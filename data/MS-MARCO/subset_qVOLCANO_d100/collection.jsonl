Over at Priceonomics, Mark Sandusky, one half of the music duo The Dirty Little Blondes, has made his financials public. During 12.5 hours of performing, the pair made a total of $532, which works out to $21.22 per hour each. Assuming a 40-hour work week, that's an annual salary of $44,137. But before you quit your day job, know that even the pros can't hit the streets and pull in that much cash every day.
