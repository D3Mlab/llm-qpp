Amella Hair 8A Brazilian Human Hair Body Wave Bundles with Closure Brazilian Body Wave Bundles 100% Unprocessed Body Wave Human Hair Care Suggestions Q1:Is it 100% Human Hair? A: Yes, Testing by BURNING - Human hair will show white smoke while burning and will turn to ash ; Synthetic hair will show black smoke and will be a sticky ball after burning. Q2:How to avoid tangling/shedding? A: Usually gets tangled because of a build-up of dirt, salt water, chlorine or dryness . Washing your hair regularly by tooth comb with high quality Shampoo and Conditioner, and combing your hair daily . Please always consult your stylist before attempting any styling techniques you are unsure. Q3:Why the hair has grey hair? A:As remy hair, it is very normal for virgin hair to have gray hairs,especially since our virgin hair is not altered.Remy hair is cut from young and healthy donor, so you can expect any natural affects such as gray hairs,some split ends,and different curl patterns in one bundle. Q4:How long does it last? A: It depends on how you maintain it.Treat it like your own hair and take very good care of it,then normally it could last 3-6months gest you use good shampoo and conditioner to condition your hair once a week,twice a week is better ,and some hair oil is necessary. Don\u2019t Use Blow Dryer or Too Much Heat. Q5:How Many Bundles Do I Need? A: Each bundle is 95(+_5)g ,As We all know ,the longer the length is,the thinner the hair will be. For a full head, We suggest:3 Bundles for 8-16inch,4 bundles for 18-24inch,Add a Closure or Frontal can make your hair look more natural. Q6.What\u2019s Recommend Hair Care Products? A:Treat the hair as your own hair, use the good shampoo and conditioner.

Especially for the curly and wave hair ,It should be stretched to straight when you measure the length . The hair is measured by hand , So there may be small inaccuracy unavoidably . Warm Tips: Normally, The weight of 1 Bundle is 95-105g , The weight of 1 Frontal is 45-80g /piece. The longer the hair is , The thinner it is .(Especially for The Length from 20 inches-30 inches ).

You\u2019d better put the hair on a shelf for a while after receiving your hair, Keep the curl better . Do not cut the weft or tracks of your virgin hair. This will cause shedding . If the wefts must be cut, please seal with weft sealant prior to installing . Wash your wig regularly ,but don't be too frequent, usually one time or two time a week , Frequent cleaning wigs can result in decrease in service life. Before washing, brush wig remove any teasing or tangles . Place your wig in cool water ( Never use hot water). Gently hand washes with a mild detergent or shampoo. Avoid contact with chlorinated water , sea water , and hot water to avoid damage to your wig. Use a towel to dry the water on your hair .

Amella Hair 8A Brazilian Human Hair Body Wave Bundles with Closure Brazilian Body Wave Bundles 100% Unprocessed Body Wave Human Hair Care Suggestions Q1:Is it 100% Human Hair? A: Yes, Testing by BURNING - Human hair will show white smoke while burning and will turn to ash ; Synthetic hair will show black smoke and will be a sticky ball after burning. Q2:How to avoid tangling/shedding? A: Usually gets tangled because of a build-up of dirt, salt water, chlorine or dryness . Washing your hair regularly by tooth comb with high quality Shampoo and Conditioner, and combing your hair daily . Please always consult your stylist before attempting any styling techniques you are unsure. Q3:Why the hair has grey hair? A:As remy hair, it is very normal for virgin hair to have gray hairs,especially since our virgin hair is not altered.Remy hair is cut from young and healthy donor, so you can expect any natural affects such as gray hairs,some split ends,and different curl patterns in one bundle. Q4:How long does it last? A: It depends on how you maintain it.Treat it like your own hair and take very good care of it,then normally it could last 3-6months gest you use good shampoo and conditioner to condition your hair once a week,twice a week is better ,and some hair oil is necessary. Don\u2019t Use Blow Dryer or Too Much Heat. Q5:How Many Bundles Do I Need? A: Each bundle is 95(+_5)g ,As We all know ,the longer the length is,the thinner the hair will be. For a full head, We suggest:3 Bundles for 8-16inch,4 bundles for 18-24inch,Add a Closure or Frontal can make your hair look more natural. Q6.What\u2019s Recommend Hair Care Products? A:Treat the hair as your own hair, use the good shampoo and conditioner. Conditioning is very important to keep the hair soft and manageable, let it on the hair 5-10 minutes and air dry instead of blowing. Q7.Hair Smell? A: Our factory wash the hair with warm water and shampoo very very clean And we will put the hair oil on the hairs to protect the hair without any dry during the long time shipping.

Warm Tips: Normally, The weight of 1 Bundle is 95-105g , The weight of 1 Frontal is 45-80g /piece. The longer the hair is , The thinner it is .(Especially for The Length from 20 inches-30 inches ). So we let 4 Bundles as a group for a full head . The Straight /Body Wave/Loose Wave comb with wide tooth comb .But Deep Wave /Kinky Curly Comb with hand finger. How to Care It ? You\u2019d better put the hair on a shelf for a while after receiving your hair, Keep the curl better . Do not cut the weft or tracks of your virgin hair. This will cause shedding . If the wefts must be cut, please seal with weft sealant prior to installing . Wash your wig regularly ,but don't be too frequent, usually one time or two time a week , Frequent cleaning wigs can result in decrease in service life. Before washing, brush wig remove any teasing or tangles . Place your wig in cool water ( Never use hot water). Gently hand washes with a mild detergent or shampoo. Avoid contact with chlorinated water , sea water , and hot water to avoid damage to your wig. Use a towel to dry the water on your hair . It is best to allow your human hair wig to air dry on a wig stand. Do not use hair dryers . Do not to sleep with wet hair. Prior to going swimming wash and leave the conditioner on your hair. This will help prevent the salt water and chlorine from drying out your extensions. Read more Aelinsi Hair Customers Show 100% Unprocessed Brazilian Virgin Human Hair Bundles Body Wave Hair FAQ : Q1.

Warm Tips: Normally, The weight of 1 Bundle is 95-105g , The weight of 1 Frontal is 45-80g /piece. The longer the hair is , The thinner it is .(Especially for The Length from 20 inches-30 inches ).

You\u2019d better put the hair on a shelf for a while after receiving your hair, Keep the curl better . Do not cut the weft or tracks of your virgin hair. This will cause shedding . If the wefts must be cut, please seal with weft sealant prior to installing . Wash your wig regularly ,but don't be too frequent, usually one time or two time a week , Frequent cleaning wigs can result in decrease in service life. Before washing, brush wig remove any teasing or tangles . Place your wig in cool water ( Never use hot water). Gently hand washes with a mild detergent or shampoo. Avoid contact with chlorinated water , sea water , and hot water to avoid damage to your wig. Use a towel to dry the water on your hair .
