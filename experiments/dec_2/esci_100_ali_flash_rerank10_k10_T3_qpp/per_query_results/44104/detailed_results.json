Big Water Bottle with Time Marker, No Quotes. 128 oz Water Bottle with Handle and Straw, BPA Free Water Bottles\tProduct Description Made for REAL Life. For Anyone Who Has Ever Asked \u201cHow Can I Increase My Water Intake\u201d? We all know a gallon a day keeps the wrinkles and brain fog away, and of course it\u2019s necessary for weight loss, healthy body functions and, well\u2026 LIFE! But drinking water is hard. Not only do we forget to drink through the day, but even if we manage to finish a small bottle, we forget to refill it! But look, we don\u2019t need cheesy statements, we need practical REMINDING that ends at a suitable time! The Right Time Markings, for the Right Hydration When it comes to water bottles there are three things everyone agrees on. It needs to fit a day\u2019s hydration, time marks should be encouraging and it needs to be practical. Now, do you like getting up in the early hours to go bathroom? Then forget bottles that end at 9pm! Instead, Life Bottle takes care of you from 7am to 7pm so your body gets full hydration AND a full nights\u2019 rest. Fill yours to the 7am line, or the Gallon Mark. You choose because ANYTHING above half a gallon is perfect! Read more Easy To Carry Not only is Life Bottle thicker and easy to grip by the handle, but we include an O-Ring and strap for transporting your Life Bottle from work to home\u2026 and all spots in between. Filled to the top it weighs 8lbs but surprisingly easy to carry to for its size! Sip it or Pour It! The flip top lid locks in the open position for drinking without falling back in your face and the wide mouth lets you add ice or fruit and use as a water jug to pour into a glass or small bottle if you wish! The double screw top lid, features a leak-proof silicone seal. For Life, and Gifts! When your Life Bottle arrives you\u2019ll notice it comes packed in a box ready for gifting. And with various colors available, you can choose what they most love. So for anyone who has ever sighed and said \u201cI really should drink more water\u201d\u2026 then this gift makes perfect sense. Is It Smash-Proof? If you drop it, it probably won\u2019t break. But listen, it is a big bottle and how full it is and the angle it lands will determine the stress resonance and the possibility of crack. So, just make sure try not to drop the bottle! :-) Read more YES! Made from BPA Free, Food Compliant Plastic Made from PET-G Plastic (DEHP/BPA Free).

For Anyone Who Has Ever Asked \u201cHow Can I Increase My Water Intake\u201d? We all know a gallon a day keeps the wrinkles and brain fog away, and of course it\u2019s necessary for weight loss, healthy body functions and, well\u2026 LIFE! But drinking water is hard. Not only do we forget to drink through the day, but even if we manage to finish a small bottle, we forget to refill it! But look, we don\u2019t need cheesy statements, we need practical REMINDING that ends at a suitable time! The Right Time Markings, for the Right Hydration When it comes to water bottles there are three things everyone agrees on. It needs to fit a day\u2019s hydration, time marks should be encouraging and it needs to be practical. Now, do you like getting up in the early hours to go bathroom? Then forget bottles that end at 9pm! Instead, Life Bottle takes care of you from 7am to 7pm so your body gets full hydration AND a full nights\u2019 rest. Fill yours to the 7am line, or the Gallon Mark. You choose because ANYTHING above half a gallon is perfect!

The flip top lid locks in the open position for drinking without falling back in your face and the wide mouth lets you add ice or fruit and use as a water jug to pour into a glass or small bottle if you wish! The double screw top lid, features a leak-proof silicone seal. For Life, and Gifts! When your Life Bottle arrives you\u2019ll notice it comes packed in a box ready for gifting. And with various colors available, you can choose what they most love.

We all know a gallon a day keeps the wrinkles and brain fog away, and of course it\u2019s necessary for weight loss, healthy body functions and, well\u2026 LIFE! But drinking water is hard.
