And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

The G1026 3 HP Shaper comes with 1/2\", 3/4\" and 1\" spindles sizes to work efficiently in combination with different sized cutters and spacers. It also comes with three table inserts which give you four possible opening diameters in the table surface. Using the smallest opening that a particular cutter allows offers more support for the workpiece and reduces the amount of chips that fall into the machine. The 3 HP motor rotates the spindles at 7000 and 10,000 RPMs. Large cutters (3-1/2\" or greater) must be operated at 7000 RPM; smaller cutters can be operated at 10,000 RPM. The precision-ground cast-iron table of the G1026 measures 28-1/4\" x 30-1/2\". The two-piece cast-iron fence is independently adjustable for different cutting thicknesses and special shaping applications. It is also removable for easy replacement with a zero-clearance or other custom-made fence. None of our competitors can come close to this price point! Like all of the Grizzly shapers, the G1026 comes with a 1-year warranty covering parts and assuring the unit is free from factory defects. (Consumables are not covered by the warranty.) The G1026 manual was written by our U.S. based Technical Documentation Department and is packed with useful information. The complete and easy-to-read manual makes it easier to assemble and maintain your shaper. The Grizzly Customer Service and Technical Support Teams are U.S. based.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors. See more Product Description Product Description We see a future built on great brands, great products, and great people. In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class.

The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

Using the smallest opening that a particular cutter allows offers more support for the workpiece and reduces the amount of chips that fall into the machine. The 3 HP motor rotates the spindles at 7000 and 10,000 RPMs. Large cutters (3-1/2\" or greater) must be operated at 7000 RPM; smaller cutters can be operated at 10,000 RPM. The precision-ground cast-iron table of the G1026 measures 28-1/4\" x 30-1/2\". The two-piece cast-iron fence is independently adjustable for different cutting thicknesses and special shaping applications. It is also removable for easy replacement with a zero-clearance or other custom-made fence. None of our competitors can come close to this price point! Like all of the Grizzly shapers, the G1026 comes with a 1-year warranty covering parts and assuring the unit is free from factory defects. (Consumables are not covered by the warranty.) The G1026 manual was written by our U.S. based Technical Documentation Department and is packed with useful information. The complete and easy-to-read manual makes it easier to assemble and maintain your shaper. The Grizzly Customer Service and Technical Support Teams are U.S. based. Parts for the shaper may be available online and shipped from the Grizzly parts warehouse in Springfield, MO.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.
