As skin\u2019s natural ability to shed surface dead skin cells declines with age, dark spots and uneven tone become increasingly more visible, leaving skin looking older and more dull.

The products can be used alone, as an entire routine or implemented into your own skincare routine. However, newly revealed skin may be sensitive to sunlight.

We have been perfecting this formula for over 25 years & are one of the leading experts in retinol skincare. NOT ALL RETINOIDS ARE CREATED EQUAL RoC is committed to making anti-aging solutions accessible to everyone. RoC uses retinol, the most potent retinoid available without a prescription, in all of our Retinol Correxion formulations (Clinical data on file). POTENCY-PRESERVING PACKAGING RoC retinol formulas are packaged in opaque tubes, glass bottles, & jars that limit exposure to light & air. This helps preserve the integrity of the retinol formula. In 2017, RoC discovered a formula that can be packaged in a jar without compromise, currently used in MAX Daily Hydration Cr\u00e8mes.
