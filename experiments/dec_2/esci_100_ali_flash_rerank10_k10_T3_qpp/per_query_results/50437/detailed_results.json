Reclaim otherwise wasted space with ease. Customizable Storage Built to satisfy a variety of storage needs, each unit comes with adjustable retention rods and shelves (multiple adjustable, 2 fixed) with raised edges that ensure any stored items remain securely held in place. Have extra tall items? The adjustable shelves are removable, and the retention rods keep tall items secured. The hanging hardware is adjustable, spanning the entire length of the cabinet to accommodate varying hinge distances, and the cabinet is reversible for right or left hinged doors.

Reclaim otherwise wasted space with ease. Customizable Storage Built to satisfy a variety of storage needs, each unit comes with adjustable retention rods and shelves (multiple adjustable, 2 fixed) with raised edges that ensure any stored items remain securely held in place. Have extra tall items? The adjustable shelves are removable, and the retention rods keep tall items secured. The hanging hardware is adjustable, spanning the entire length of the cabinet to accommodate varying hinge distances, and the cabinet is reversible for right or left hinged doors. Quality Finishes & Materials Typical over-the-door storage options are often unsightly, or purely utilitarian with little thought placed on aesthetic design. The Cabidor uses high quality materials, with finishes more consistent with high end cabinetry. High grade steel retention rods and an oil based enamel finish compliment your decor rather than detracting from it. High grade steel hanging hardware ensures a safe, stable installation.
