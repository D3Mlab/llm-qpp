Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen.

It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods.

Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less.

The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Pre-cut and boasting eye-catching decorator prints, our beeswax covers let you wrap-up foods in record time. Save money on convenience foods that are full of fat and sodium by making low-cost and healthy lunches that will turn your coworkers\u2019 heads.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up.

Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Easy-lock Lid Transparent to let you watch the freezing process as it progresses. Lid is designed to easily lock to base. Mixing Paddle Mixes and aerates ingredients in freezer bowl to create frozen desserts or drinks. Freezer Bowl Contains cooling liquid within a double insulated wall to create fast and even freezing.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours.

Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout.

Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.From the manufacturer Cuisinart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker Cuisinart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker Cuisinart Compressor Ice Cream & Gelato Maker Cuisinart Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet & Ice Cream Maker Cuisinart Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream, Gelato & Sorbet Maker Cuisinart Flavor Duo Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker Item # ICE-20P1 ICE-21R ICE-100 ICE-30BCP1 ICE-70P1 ICE-40 Freezer Bowl Capacity 1.5-Quart 1.5-Quart 1.5-Quart 2-Quart 2-Quart 1-Quart (Double Sided) Frozen Treats Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream, Gelato & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream, Gelato & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Ingredients Feeder Spout Spout Window Spout Spout 2 Spouts Double Insulated Freezer Bowl \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 2 Bowls Auto Shut-Off \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 30-Minute \u2713 Easy Lock Lid \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Digital LCD Screen \u2713 \u2713 Color White White Black/Stainless Steel Brushed Chrome Stainless Steel Brushed Chrome/White Recipe Book Included \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\n***\n\nOutput only your reformulated query:"

Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.From the manufacturer Cuisinart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker Cuisinart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker Cuisinart Compressor Ice Cream & Gelato Maker Cuisinart Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet & Ice Cream Maker Cuisinart Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream, Gelato & Sorbet Maker Cuisinart Flavor Duo Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker Item # ICE-20P1 ICE-21R ICE-100 ICE-30BCP1 ICE-70P1 ICE-40 Freezer Bowl Capacity 1.5-Quart 1.5-Quart 1.5-Quart 2-Quart 2-Quart 1-Quart (Double Sided) Frozen Treats Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream, Gelato & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream, Gelato & Sorbet Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream & Sorbet Ingredients Feeder Spout Spout Window Spout Spout 2 Spouts Double Insulated Freezer Bowl \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 2 Bowls Auto Shut-Off \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 30-Minute \u2713 Easy Lock Lid \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Digital LCD Screen \u2713 \u2713 Color White White Black/Stainless Steel Brushed Chrome Stainless Steel Brushed Chrome/White Recipe Book Included \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\n\n",

Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods.

Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete.

Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours.

Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less. Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less.

The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods.

Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen.

Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours.

Rubber Feet Nonslip feet keep base stationary during use. Cord Storage Unused cord is easily pushed into the base to keep counter neat and safe. Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods.

The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours. Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.
