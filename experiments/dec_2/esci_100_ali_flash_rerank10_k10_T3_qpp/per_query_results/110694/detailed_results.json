It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives. Developed by our in-house chemists, our formulations are proprietary, structural, and marine grade. These epoxies have set the standard for epoxy quality in the marine industry and beyond since 1969.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats. Many of the wood/epoxy construction techniques that have made modern wooden boats so successful can also be applied to the repair of older wooden boats with excellent results. Gougeon Brothers, Inc., the company that has been formulating and manufacturing WEST SYSTEM Epoxies since 1969. They pioneered the use of epoxy to enhance wood's natural structural properties. Ease of use, ready availability, safety and easy access to instructional materials makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy a great choice for wooden boat construction and repairs. Furniture & Crafts The Eat a Peach Tribute Guitar using marquetry skills and WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Whether you're creating a river table, casting jewelry and works of art, making high-end knives, repairing sporting equipment, creating sculptures for public spaces, designing cosplay props, or building or repairing musical instruments, WEST SYSTEM Epoxy is versatile and reliable. Woodworkers and creators of all kinds depend on WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Home Repairs & Improvements The detail work on this Victorian home was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Homeowners rely on WEST SYSTEM Epoxy because it's versatile, reliable, readily available, consistent, and offers excellent instructional materials. WEST SYSTEM customers have used it to create spiral staircases, grand entry columns, and cherry wood basins. They've used it to build fences, trellises, and planter boxes, and neighborhood mini-libraries that can withstand decades outdoors. And to repair everything from porches and wooden window sashes to fiberglass tub and shower surfaces. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy an ideal adhesive and coating for lasting home repairs.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives. Developed by our in-house chemists, our formulations are proprietary, structural, and marine grade. These epoxies have set the standard for epoxy quality in the marine industry and beyond since 1969.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats. Many of the wood/epoxy construction techniques that have made modern wooden boats so successful can also be applied to the repair of older wooden boats with excellent results. Gougeon Brothers, Inc., the company that has been formulating and manufacturing WEST SYSTEM Epoxies since 1969. They pioneered the use of epoxy to enhance wood's natural structural properties. Ease of use, ready availability, safety and easy access to instructional materials makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy a great choice for wooden boat construction and repairs.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats. Many of the wood/epoxy construction techniques that have made modern wooden boats so successful can also be applied to the repair of older wooden boats with excellent results. Gougeon Brothers, Inc., the company that has been formulating and manufacturing WEST SYSTEM Epoxies since 1969. They pioneered the use of epoxy to enhance wood's natural structural properties.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.
