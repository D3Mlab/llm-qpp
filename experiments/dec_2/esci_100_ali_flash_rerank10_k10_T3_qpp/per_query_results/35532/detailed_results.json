These combine a belt driven drill press with the dual coordinate abilities of the milling machine's table for flexibility and efficiency. A locking collet prevents the cutting tool from falling away from the spindle when lateral forces are experienced against the bit. Although light in construction, the JMD Milling Drilling Machines possess the advantages of space-saving versatility, affordability and light machining capability. Amazon.com With its generously sized worktable and hinged belt cover for faster speed changing, the Jet JMD-18 Mill Drill Machine is efficient and precise, whether you're working with aluminum, wood, or even ceramic tile. Powered by a UL-listed motor, this high-performance tool has a drilling capacity of 1-1/4 inch and a 15-7/8-inch swing. It also boasts a three-inch face mill capacity, a 3/4-inch end mill capacity, and a host of innovative features, like an easy-to-read internal depth gauge and a worklamp. Extra-Large Work Table for Bigger Jobs Thanks to its extra large, 9.5 x 31.75-inch worktable, the JMD-18 gives you the freedom to tackle larger scale projects that require more space and flexibility. And the included worklamp provides ample illumination of any size work piece, even in dim conditions. 2 HP Motor and Hinged Belt Cover for Power and Fast Results The JMD-18 operates with a powerful UL-listed, 2 HP, one phase, 230-volt motor that gives the tool a range of 12 spindle speeds from 15 to 3,000 RPM. And to minimize delays and wait periods as you transition to different speeds, this motor is also supported by a hinged belt cover that offers faster speed changing. Cast Iron Column and Heavy-Duty Roller Bearings for Support and Stability The JMD-18 has a strong, supportive design. First, a one-piece cast iron column offers additional support where you need it, giving you the freedom to handle heavier material without worry. And heavy-duty, tapered roller bearings support the spindle for greater tolerance and more accurate drilling depth. Easy-Read Depth Gauge and 360-Degree Swiveling Head for Precision Easy to operate, the JMD-18 offers user-friendly features, like satin finished easy-read dials, to guide you through every step of your project. A positive quick-stop knob combines with an easy-to-read internal depth gauge for consistency, while a 360-degree swiveling head gives you the flexibility you need for precise results. The JMD-18 is backed by a two year warranty. About JET: A History of Sharing New, Feature-Rich Products Opened in 1958 after the founder of the company, Leslie P. Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, Washington to Japan, JET began as a small dealer that sold air hoists and trolleys out of a single hardware store in Seattle.

And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service.

These combine a belt driven drill press with the dual coordinate abilities of the milling machine's table for flexibility and efficiency. A locking collet prevents the cutting tool from falling away from the spindle when lateral forces are experienced against the bit. Although light in construction, the JMD Milling Drilling Machines possess the advantages of space-saving versatility, affordability and light machining capability. Amazon.com With its generously sized worktable and hinged belt cover for faster speed changing, the Jet JMD-18 Mill Drill Machine is efficient and precise, whether you're working with aluminum, wood, or even ceramic tile. Powered by a UL-listed motor, this high-performance tool has a drilling capacity of 1-1/4 inch and a 15-7/8-inch swing. It also boasts a three-inch face mill capacity, a 3/4-inch end mill capacity, and a host of innovative features, like an easy-to-read internal depth gauge and a worklamp. Extra-Large Work Table for Bigger Jobs Thanks to its extra large, 9.5 x 31.75-inch worktable, the JMD-18 gives you the freedom to tackle larger scale projects that require more space and flexibility. And the included worklamp provides ample illumination of any size work piece, even in dim conditions. 2 HP Motor and Hinged Belt Cover for Power and Fast Results The JMD-18 operates with a powerful UL-listed, 2 HP, one phase, 230-volt motor that gives the tool a range of 12 spindle speeds from 15 to 3,000 RPM. And to minimize delays and wait periods as you transition to different speeds, this motor is also supported by a hinged belt cover that offers faster speed changing. Cast Iron Column and Heavy-Duty Roller Bearings for Support and Stability The JMD-18 has a strong, supportive design. First, a one-piece cast iron column offers additional support where you need it, giving you the freedom to handle heavier material without worry. And heavy-duty, tapered roller bearings support the spindle for greater tolerance and more accurate drilling depth. Easy-Read Depth Gauge and 360-Degree Swiveling Head for Precision Easy to operate, the JMD-18 offers user-friendly features, like satin finished easy-read dials, to guide you through every step of your project. A positive quick-stop knob combines with an easy-to-read internal depth gauge for consistency, while a 360-degree swiveling head gives you the flexibility you need for precise results. The JMD-18 is backed by a two year warranty. About JET: A History of Sharing New, Feature-Rich Products Opened in 1958 after the founder of the company, Leslie P. Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, Washington to Japan, JET began as a small dealer that sold air hoists and trolleys out of a single hardware store in Seattle.

And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service.
