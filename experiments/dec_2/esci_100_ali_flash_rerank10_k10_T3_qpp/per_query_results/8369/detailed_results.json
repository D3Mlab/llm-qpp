With the easy to replace Smart Extruder+ and Flex Build Plate maintenance is quick and easy. A front facing filament drawer lets you change out colors or material types without flipping your printer around. Read more MakerBot Print What is MakerBot Print? MakerBot Print is free software that optimizes and streamlines the 3D printing process for any workflow. It allows you to discover, prepare, manage, and share 3D prints. Native CAD Support Save time by importing native CAD files, like parts and assemblies. Reduce the number of files to manage, and eliminate the need to convert files to an STL format which prevents conversion errors. Optimized Printing Our new slicer algorithm automatically adjusts slice settings for your specific printer model, software version, and Smart Extruder type. The new print preview helps verify design details before printing, and includes rafts and supports break away more easily for a cleaner print surface. Cloud-Enabled Management Auto Arrange multiple build plates at once Improved Rafts for cleaner prints Redesigned Breakaway Supports Read more MakerBot Smart Extruder+ Ease of Use, Reliability, and Superior Results with MakerBot PLA Filament.

At same time, it can minimize damages or offsets to the build plate. Read more Intelligent assisted leveling system. More precise and easier calibration Finder features an intuitive calibration detection system to assist leveling. You are directed to tighten or loosen leveling screws until a beeper barely sounds, then it detects the distance between nozzle and build plate to verify whether your leveling is at the right position. Once the first location is leveled, you\u2019re directed to next two screw locations accordingly with same operation. In this whole process, you\u2019re well instructed with clear messages on the touchscreen display. And all of these make calibration much easier and more precise than before.
