Read more Differences in Steel In metallurgy, stainless steel is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of 11.5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not stain, corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel (it 'stains less'), but it is not stain-proof. For example, mayonnaise left on a knife blade in the sink seems to stain the blade a darker color. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment to which the material will be subjected in its lifetime. Stainless steels have sufficient amount of chromium present so that a passive film of chromium oxide forms which prevents further corrosion. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and affordability make it an ideal base material for a host of commercial applications including flatware. There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. For greater hardness and strength, carbon is added. When subjected to adequate heat treatment, these steels are used as razor blades, cutlery, flatware, etc. A typical composition of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, commonly known as 18/8 stainless, is often used in flatware. 18/8 has approximately 18% chromium, and from 8-10 percent nickel. The nomenclature 18/8, and 18/10 are sometimes both used to represent the same type steel. 18/0 has 18 percent chromium, and no nickel. This common steel is often used in flatware sets as it combines the stain resistant elements of 18/8 at a lower cost. In recent years the price of nickel has increased by tenfold. Care: Most stainless steel spoons and forks are marked with their steel chemistry; usually 18/0, 18/8, or 18/10. All of these compositions should give you years of use with limited maintenance. If you notice discoloring, or small oxidation marks on your stainless, it can usually be cleaned off with hot soapy water, and a sponge. If that doesn\u2019t so the trick, use a good quality stainless polish. Often, a rust spot on your flatware is not the flatware itself, but a dissimilar steel peeler or other item leaning against it in the dishwasher. There are many unique finishes available on flatware these days. The most durable and stain resistant is a high gloss mirror finish. A smooth mirror finish leaves little for oxidizing agents to attack. Satin finish (also known as brushed) breaks the surface of the steel, so it is more prone to staining. However, satin finishes, like on our Norse pattern, can be revitalized simple by scrubbing (in the direction of the 'grain') with a scotch-brite pad, or very fine steel wool. This cleans off the surface, and adds more micro scratches. Don\u2019t try and scrub a frosted (also known as sand blast, or bead blast) finish, such as Pendulum. Just use a good stainless polish and a soft cloth. Lafayette : Our Most Popular Pattern Back in the 15th and 16th century colonial period, silver tableware was made from silver coins, since our country did not have any silver mines at this time. The coins were melted down, shaped, and hammered to their final form. Lafayette is a beautiful rendition of the hand hammered flatware of the colonial period. If a rustic, hammered look is what you're going for, look no further than Lafayette pattern. With its hammered finish and clean design, the Lafayette pattern is ready for everyday use. From kids to your most distinguished guests, the Lafayette collection is sure to please. The handles taper from a slender neck to a rounded tab end which lifts up off the table. The spoon bowls are squared off for a contemporary look, the forks feature extra-long tines, and the knife is constructed of one solid piece. We offer this pattern in a variety of ways; Set of 20, Set of 42, 5-piece place setting, 4-piece hostess set. All pieces are made from 18/0 stainless steel and are dishwasher safe.

Read more Differences in Steel In metallurgy, stainless steel is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of 11.5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not stain, corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel (it 'stains less'), but it is not stain-proof. For example, mayonnaise left on a knife blade in the sink seems to stain the blade a darker color. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment to which the material will be subjected in its lifetime. Stainless steels have sufficient amount of chromium present so that a passive film of chromium oxide forms which prevents further corrosion. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and affordability make it an ideal base material for a host of commercial applications including flatware. There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. For greater hardness and strength, carbon is added. When subjected to adequate heat treatment, these steels are used as razor blades, cutlery, flatware, etc. A typical composition of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, commonly known as 18/8 stainless, is often used in flatware. 18/8 has approximately 18% chromium, and from 8-10 percent nickel. The nomenclature 18/8, and 18/10 are sometimes both used to represent the same type steel. 18/0 has 18 percent chromium, and no nickel. This common steel is often used in flatware sets as it combines the stain resistant elements of 18/8 at a lower cost. In recent years the price of nickel has increased by tenfold. Care: Most stainless steel spoons and forks are marked with their steel chemistry; usually 18/0, 18/8, or 18/10. All of these compositions should give you years of use with limited maintenance. If you notice discoloring, or small oxidation marks on your stainless, it can usually be cleaned off with hot soapy water, and a sponge. If that doesn\u2019t so the trick, use a good quality stainless polish. Often, a rust spot on your flatware is not the flatware itself, but a dissimilar steel peeler or other item leaning against it in the dishwasher. There are many unique finishes available on flatware these days. The most durable and stain resistant is a high gloss mirror finish. A smooth mirror finish leaves little for oxidizing agents to attack. Satin finish (also known as brushed) breaks the surface of the steel, so it is more prone to staining. However, satin finishes, like on our Norse pattern, can be revitalized simple by scrubbing (in the direction of the 'grain') with a scotch-brite pad, or very fine steel wool. This cleans off the surface, and adds more micro scratches. Don\u2019t try and scrub a frosted (also known as sand blast, or bead blast) finish, such as Pendulum. Just use a good stainless polish and a soft cloth. Lafayette : Our Most Popular Pattern Back in the 15th and 16th century colonial period, silver tableware was made from silver coins, since our country did not have any silver mines at this time. The coins were melted down, shaped, and hammered to their final form. Lafayette is a beautiful rendition of the hand hammered flatware of the colonial period. If a rustic, hammered look is what you're going for, look no further than Lafayette pattern. With its hammered finish and clean design, the Lafayette pattern is ready for everyday use. From kids to your most distinguished guests, the Lafayette collection is sure to please. The handles taper from a slender neck to a rounded tab end which lifts up off the table. The spoon bowls are squared off for a contemporary look, the forks feature extra-long tines, and the knife is constructed of one solid piece. We offer this pattern in a variety of ways; Set of 20, Set of 42, 5-piece place setting, 4-piece hostess set. All pieces are made from 18/0 stainless steel and are dishwasher safe.

Read more Differences in Steel In metallurgy, stainless steel is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of 11.5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not stain, corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel (it 'stains less'), but it is not stain-proof. For example, mayonnaise left on a knife blade in the sink seems to stain the blade a darker color. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment to which the material will be subjected in its lifetime. Stainless steels have sufficient amount of chromium present so that a passive film of chromium oxide forms which prevents further corrosion. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and affordability make it an ideal base material for a host of commercial applications including flatware. There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. For greater hardness and strength, carbon is added. When subjected to adequate heat treatment, these steels are used as razor blades, cutlery, flatware, etc. A typical composition of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, commonly known as 18/8 stainless, is often used in flatware. 18/8 has approximately 18% chromium, and from 8-10 percent nickel. The nomenclature 18/8, and 18/10 are sometimes both used to represent the same type steel. 18/0 has 18 percent chromium, and no nickel. This common steel is often used in flatware sets as it combines the stain resistant elements of 18/8 at a lower cost. In recent years the price of nickel has increased by tenfold. Care: Most stainless steel spoons and forks are marked with their steel chemistry; usually 18/0, 18/8, or 18/10. All of these compositions should give you years of use with limited maintenance. If you notice discoloring, or small oxidation marks on your stainless, it can usually be cleaned off with hot soapy water, and a sponge. If that doesn\u2019t so the trick, use a good quality stainless polish. Often, a rust spot on your flatware is not the flatware itself, but a dissimilar steel peeler or other item leaning against it in the dishwasher. There are many unique finishes available on flatware these days. The most durable and stain resistant is a high gloss mirror finish. A smooth mirror finish leaves little for oxidizing agents to attack. Satin finish (also known as brushed) breaks the surface of the steel, so it is more prone to staining. However, satin finishes, like on our Norse pattern, can be revitalized simple by scrubbing (in the direction of the 'grain') with a scotch-brite pad, or very fine steel wool. This cleans off the surface, and adds more micro scratches. Don\u2019t try and scrub a frosted (also known as sand blast, or bead blast) finish, such as Pendulum. Just use a good stainless polish and a soft cloth. Lafayette : Our Most Popular Pattern Back in the 15th and 16th century colonial period, silver tableware was made from silver coins, since our country did not have any silver mines at this time. The coins were melted down, shaped, and hammered to their final form. Lafayette is a beautiful rendition of the hand hammered flatware of the colonial period. If a rustic, hammered look is what you're going for, look no further than Lafayette pattern. With its hammered finish and clean design, the Lafayette pattern is ready for everyday use. From kids to your most distinguished guests, the Lafayette collection is sure to please. The handles taper from a slender neck to a rounded tab end which lifts up off the table. The spoon bowls are squared off for a contemporary look, the forks feature extra-long tines, and the knife is constructed of one solid piece. We offer this pattern in a variety of ways; Set of 20, Set of 42, 5-piece place setting, 4-piece hostess set. All pieces are made from 18/0 stainless steel and are dishwasher safe.

Read more Differences in Steel In metallurgy, stainless steel is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of 11.5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not stain, corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel (it 'stains less'), but it is not stain-proof. For example, mayonnaise left on a knife blade in the sink seems to stain the blade a darker color. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment to which the material will be subjected in its lifetime. Stainless steels have sufficient amount of chromium present so that a passive film of chromium oxide forms which prevents further corrosion. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and affordability make it an ideal base material for a host of commercial applications including flatware. There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. For greater hardness and strength, carbon is added. When subjected to adequate heat treatment, these steels are used as razor blades, cutlery, flatware, etc. A typical composition of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, commonly known as 18/8 stainless, is often used in flatware. 18/8 has approximately 18% chromium, and from 8-10 percent nickel. The nomenclature 18/8, and 18/10 are sometimes both used to represent the same type steel. 18/0 has 18 percent chromium, and no nickel. This common steel is often used in flatware sets as it combines the stain resistant elements of 18/8 at a lower cost. In recent years the price of nickel has increased by tenfold. Care: Most stainless steel spoons and forks are marked with their steel chemistry; usually 18/0, 18/8, or 18/10. All of these compositions should give you years of use with limited maintenance. If you notice discoloring, or small oxidation marks on your stainless, it can usually be cleaned off with hot soapy water, and a sponge. If that doesn\u2019t so the trick, use a good quality stainless polish. Often, a rust spot on your flatware is not the flatware itself, but a dissimilar steel peeler or other item leaning against it in the dishwasher. There are many unique finishes available on flatware these days. The most durable and stain resistant is a high gloss mirror finish. A smooth mirror finish leaves little for oxidizing agents to attack. Satin finish (also known as brushed) breaks the surface of the steel, so it is more prone to staining. However, satin finishes, like on our Norse pattern, can be revitalized simple by scrubbing (in the direction of the 'grain') with a scotch-brite pad, or very fine steel wool. This cleans off the surface, and adds more micro scratches. Don\u2019t try and scrub a frosted (also known as sand blast, or bead blast) finish, such as Pendulum. Just use a good stainless polish and a soft cloth. Lafayette : Our Most Popular Pattern Back in the 15th and 16th century colonial period, silver tableware was made from silver coins, since our country did not have any silver mines at this time. The coins were melted down, shaped, and hammered to their final form. Lafayette is a beautiful rendition of the hand hammered flatware of the colonial period. If a rustic, hammered look is what you're going for, look no further than Lafayette pattern. With its hammered finish and clean design, the Lafayette pattern is ready for everyday use. From kids to your most distinguished guests, the Lafayette collection is sure to please. The handles taper from a slender neck to a rounded tab end which lifts up off the table. The spoon bowls are squared off for a contemporary look, the forks feature extra-long tines, and the knife is constructed of one solid piece. We offer this pattern in a variety of ways; Set of 20, Set of 42, 5-piece place setting, 4-piece hostess set. All pieces are made from 18/0 stainless steel and are dishwasher safe.

Read more Differences in Steel In metallurgy, stainless steel is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of 11.5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not stain, corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel (it 'stains less'), but it is not stain-proof. For example, mayonnaise left on a knife blade in the sink seems to stain the blade a darker color. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment to which the material will be subjected in its lifetime. Stainless steels have sufficient amount of chromium present so that a passive film of chromium oxide forms which prevents further corrosion. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and affordability make it an ideal base material for a host of commercial applications including flatware. There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. For greater hardness and strength, carbon is added. When subjected to adequate heat treatment, these steels are used as razor blades, cutlery, flatware, etc. A typical composition of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, commonly known as 18/8 stainless, is often used in flatware. 18/8 has approximately 18% chromium, and from 8-10 percent nickel. The nomenclature 18/8, and 18/10 are sometimes both used to represent the same type steel. 18/0 has 18 percent chromium, and no nickel. This common steel is often used in flatware sets as it combines the stain resistant elements of 18/8 at a lower cost. In recent years the price of nickel has increased by tenfold. Care: Most stainless steel spoons and forks are marked with their steel chemistry; usually 18/0, 18/8, or 18/10. All of these compositions should give you years of use with limited maintenance. If you notice discoloring, or small oxidation marks on your stainless, it can usually be cleaned off with hot soapy water, and a sponge. If that doesn\u2019t so the trick, use a good quality stainless polish. Often, a rust spot on your flatware is not the flatware itself, but a dissimilar steel peeler or other item leaning against it in the dishwasher. There are many unique finishes available on flatware these days. The most durable and stain resistant is a high gloss mirror finish. A smooth mirror finish leaves little for oxidizing agents to attack. Satin finish (also known as brushed) breaks the surface of the steel, so it is more prone to staining. However, satin finishes, like on our Norse pattern, can be revitalized simple by scrubbing (in the direction of the 'grain') with a scotch-brite pad, or very fine steel wool. This cleans off the surface, and adds more micro scratches. Don\u2019t try and scrub a frosted (also known as sand blast, or bead blast) finish, such as Pendulum. Just use a good stainless polish and a soft cloth. Lafayette : Our Most Popular Pattern Back in the 15th and 16th century colonial period, silver tableware was made from silver coins, since our country did not have any silver mines at this time. The coins were melted down, shaped, and hammered to their final form. Lafayette is a beautiful rendition of the hand hammered flatware of the colonial period. If a rustic, hammered look is what you're going for, look no further than Lafayette pattern. With its hammered finish and clean design, the Lafayette pattern is ready for everyday use. From kids to your most distinguished guests, the Lafayette collection is sure to please. The handles taper from a slender neck to a rounded tab end which lifts up off the table. The spoon bowls are squared off for a contemporary look, the forks feature extra-long tines, and the knife is constructed of one solid piece. We offer this pattern in a variety of ways; Set of 20, Set of 42, 5-piece place setting, 4-piece hostess set. All pieces are made from 18/0 stainless steel and are dishwasher safe.

Read more Differences in Steel In metallurgy, stainless steel is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of 11.5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not stain, corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel (it 'stains less'), but it is not stain-proof. For example, mayonnaise left on a knife blade in the sink seems to stain the blade a darker color. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment to which the material will be subjected in its lifetime. Stainless steels have sufficient amount of chromium present so that a passive film of chromium oxide forms which prevents further corrosion. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and affordability make it an ideal base material for a host of commercial applications including flatware. There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. For greater hardness and strength, carbon is added. When subjected to adequate heat treatment, these steels are used as razor blades, cutlery, flatware, etc. A typical composition of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, commonly known as 18/8 stainless, is often used in flatware. 18/8 has approximately 18% chromium, and from 8-10 percent nickel. The nomenclature 18/8, and 18/10 are sometimes both used to represent the same type steel. 18/0 has 18 percent chromium, and no nickel. This common steel is often used in flatware sets as it combines the stain resistant elements of 18/8 at a lower cost. In recent years the price of nickel has increased by tenfold. Care: Most stainless steel spoons and forks are marked with their steel chemistry; usually 18/0, 18/8, or 18/10. All of these compositions should give you years of use with limited maintenance. If you notice discoloring, or small oxidation marks on your stainless, it can usually be cleaned off with hot soapy water, and a sponge. If that doesn\u2019t so the trick, use a good quality stainless polish. Often, a rust spot on your flatware is not the flatware itself, but a dissimilar steel peeler or other item leaning against it in the dishwasher. There are many unique finishes available on flatware these days. The most durable and stain resistant is a high gloss mirror finish. A smooth mirror finish leaves little for oxidizing agents to attack. Satin finish (also known as brushed) breaks the surface of the steel, so it is more prone to staining. However, satin finishes, like on our Norse pattern, can be revitalized simple by scrubbing (in the direction of the 'grain') with a scotch-brite pad, or very fine steel wool. This cleans off the surface, and adds more micro scratches. Don\u2019t try and scrub a frosted (also known as sand blast, or bead blast) finish, such as Pendulum. Just use a good stainless polish and a soft cloth. Lafayette : Our Most Popular Pattern Back in the 15th and 16th century colonial period, silver tableware was made from silver coins, since our country did not have any silver mines at this time. The coins were melted down, shaped, and hammered to their final form. Lafayette is a beautiful rendition of the hand hammered flatware of the colonial period. If a rustic, hammered look is what you're going for, look no further than Lafayette pattern. With its hammered finish and clean design, the Lafayette pattern is ready for everyday use. From kids to your most distinguished guests, the Lafayette collection is sure to please. The handles taper from a slender neck to a rounded tab end which lifts up off the table. The spoon bowls are squared off for a contemporary look, the forks feature extra-long tines, and the knife is constructed of one solid piece. We offer this pattern in a variety of ways; Set of 20, Set of 42, 5-piece place setting, 4-piece hostess set. All pieces are made from 18/0 stainless steel and are dishwasher safe.
