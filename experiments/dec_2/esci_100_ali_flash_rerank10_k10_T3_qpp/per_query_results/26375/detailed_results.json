Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder. A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men\u2019s (1919) and ladies\u2019 (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931).
