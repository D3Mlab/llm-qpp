Icecap for Migraines, Chemo, Sinus Relief, Head Tension, Menopause and More (X-Large)\tProduct Description All Over Relief That Lasts, At Last! Imagine finally leaving the house to do the things you love without the burden of migraine. That was the case for Mary when she discovered Icekap. After 10-years of not being able to go to the gym, she finally could! And while it\u2019s certainly not a miracle, it IS the patented therapeutic, drug-free headache relief the world loves right now. Soft fleece, adjustable occipital band, ponytail loop, all-over ice coverage, reversible and more! Read more First of Its Kind \u2013 Patented Headache Therapy Since its release, ICEKAP has reached global medical support including recommendations from Natural Health Practitioners, Neurologists and Registered MD\u2019s. ICEKAP Therapeutics Inc. is also proud to support the National Children's Cancer Society and is used in their hospitals all over the world. But what makes Icekap unique? Well, the soft micro-fleece and adjustable occipital tension band allows your head to melt into the fabric while also creating the correct compression. The special ponytail loop gets hair out of the way. It is this patented trio that creates the optimized therapeutic compression you\u2019ve been looking for. 200% Longer Cooling for Longer Lasting Relief We all know it can take longer than an hour to soothe a migraine, yet many other headache icepacks only last that long! As a medically recognized device, Icekap comes with 5 Therapy Grade Non-Toxic Gel Ice Packs that last up to 3 hours! They remain soft when frozen, and can be heated OR cooled for your needs. Icekap lets you customize how many ice packs to wear. Finally, each ice pocket is strategically placed for targeted relief to a key area, or soothing all over coverage. Customizable to Fit Your Changing Needs Best Who can know exactly how pain or tension will manifest on any given day? Often the occiput needs a little TLC, while other days it\u2019s those aching eye sockets. But with Icekap, you can meet those variations head on \u2026 so to speak. Fill it with 5 ice packs for all-over coverage, or just a few for target relief. For the sinuses or eyes, pull forwards or better still\u2026 wear Icekap backwards! Our advanced design also means Icekap conforms to your head so you can sink in for a comfortable sleep. Read more Tension Melting Materials, and Design Icekap comes in 5 sizes with an easy-to-use adjustable strap for the perfect compression.

Read more Won\u2019t Fall Off Overnight, Or Any Other Time! You\u2019d think 5 gel packs might slip around and create uneven weight tension.

Next, you get to choose the size most fitted to your head to prevent bunching or \u2018riding up\u2019\u2026 \u2026 And finally, the \u201cbeanie\u201d shape combined with adjustable straps keeps Icekap fully conformed to the shape of your head \u2013 no matter how restless you sleep!

Imagine finally leaving the house to do the things you love without the burden of migraine. That was the case for Mary when she discovered Icekap. After 10-years of not being able to go to the gym, she finally could! And while it\u2019s certainly not a miracle, it IS the patented therapeutic, drug-free headache relief the world loves right now.

ICEKAP Therapeutics Inc. is also proud to support the National Children's Cancer Society and is used in their hospitals all over the world. But what makes Icekap unique? Well, the soft micro-fleece and adjustable occipital tension band allows your head to melt into the fabric while also creating the correct compression. The special ponytail loop gets hair out of the way. It is this patented trio that creates the optimized therapeutic compression you\u2019ve been looking for. 200% Longer Cooling for Longer Lasting Relief We all know it can take longer than an hour to soothe a migraine, yet many other headache icepacks only last that long! As a medically recognized device, Icekap comes with 5 Therapy Grade Non-Toxic Gel Ice Packs that last up to 3 hours! They remain soft when frozen, and can be heated OR cooled for your needs. Icekap lets you customize how many ice packs to wear. Finally, each ice pocket is strategically placed for targeted relief to a key area, or soothing all over coverage. Customizable to Fit Your Changing Needs Best Who can know exactly how pain or tension will manifest on any given day? Often the occiput needs a little TLC, while other days it\u2019s those aching eye sockets. But with Icekap, you can meet those variations head on \u2026 so to speak. Fill it with 5 ice packs for all-over coverage, or just a few for target relief. For the sinuses or eyes, pull forwards or better still\u2026 wear Icekap backwards!
