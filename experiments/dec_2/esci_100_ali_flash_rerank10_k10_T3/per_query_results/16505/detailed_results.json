For ceilings 9 feet and higher, an extension down rod is recommended to place ceiling fan at correct height for optimum performance. Combo Mount This ceiling fan can be installed with or without the included down rod. In rooms with low ceilings, installing the fan without the down rod will increase the distance between the floor and the fan blades.

Summer Mode - In the Summer, Westinghouse ceiling fans keep you pleasantly cool. Run your ceiling fan counterclockwise in the Summer to set air in motion. Winter Mode - In the Winter, Westinghouse ceiling fans can be reversed to rotate in the clockwise direction. As a result, the warm air that collects near the ceiling is distributed evenly throughout the room, eliminating cold spots and drafts. Ceiling fan blades should be at least 7 feet from the floor, but no higher than 8 - 9 feet. For ceilings 9 feet and higher, an extension down rod is recommended to place ceiling fan at correct height for optimum performance. Combo Mount This ceiling fan can be installed with or without the included down rod. In rooms with low ceilings, installing the fan without the down rod will increase the distance between the floor and the fan blades. It can also be installed with an extension down rod (sold separately). Read more Since 1946, Westinghouse Lighting has built and maintained a solid reputation as a trusted global brand.

Summer Mode - In the Summer, Westinghouse ceiling fans keep you pleasantly cool. Run your ceiling fan counterclockwise in the Summer to set air in motion. Winter Mode - In the Winter, Westinghouse ceiling fans can be reversed to rotate in the clockwise direction. As a result, the warm air that collects near the ceiling is distributed evenly throughout the room, eliminating cold spots and drafts. Ceiling fan blades should be at least 7 feet from the floor, but no higher than 8 - 9 feet. For ceilings 9 feet and higher, an extension down rod is recommended to place ceiling fan at correct height for optimum performance. Combo Mount This ceiling fan can be installed with or without the included down rod. In rooms with low ceilings, installing the fan without the down rod will increase the distance between the floor and the fan blades. It can also be installed with an extension down rod (sold separately). Read more Since 1946, Westinghouse Lighting has built and maintained a solid reputation as a trusted global brand.

Summer Mode - In the Summer, Westinghouse ceiling fans keep you pleasantly cool. Run your ceiling fan counterclockwise in the Summer to set air in motion. Winter Mode - In the Winter, Westinghouse ceiling fans can be reversed to rotate in the clockwise direction. As a result, the warm air that collects near the ceiling is distributed evenly throughout the room, eliminating cold spots and drafts. Ceiling fan blades should be at least 7 feet from the floor, but no higher than 8 - 9 feet. For ceilings 9 feet and higher, an extension down rod is recommended to place ceiling fan at correct height for optimum performance. Combo Mount This ceiling fan can be installed with or without the included down rod. In rooms with low ceilings, installing the fan without the down rod will increase the distance between the floor and the fan blades. It can also be installed with an extension down rod (sold separately). Read more Since 1946, Westinghouse Lighting has built and maintained a solid reputation as a trusted global brand.

Fan Performance on High Speed Airflow: 4789 Cubic Feet Per Minute Energy Usage: 59 Watts (excludes lights) Airflow Efficiency: 81 Cubic Feet Per Minute Per Watt Read more Summer Mode In the summer, Westinghouse ceiling fans keep your home pleasantly cool. The ceiling fan runs counterclockwise, and sets the air in motion. The airflow creates a wind chill effect on your skin. Using a ceiling fan and air conditioning unit simultaneously allows you to raise your thermostat setting without a change in comfort. Winter Mode In winter, Westinghouse ceiling fans can be switched to the clockwise direction. As a result, the warm air that collects near the ceiling is distributed evenly throughout the room eliminating cold spots and drafts. Turn fans on only when using rooms in which they\u2019re located to dramatically increase your comfort level and decrease energy costs.

For ceilings 9 feet and higher, an extension down rod is recommended to place ceiling fan at correct height for optimum performance.

Fan Performance on High Speed Airflow: 4789 Cubic Feet Per Minute Energy Usage: 59 Watts (excludes lights) Airflow Efficiency: 81 Cubic Feet Per Minute Per Watt Read more Summer Mode In the summer, Westinghouse ceiling fans keep your home pleasantly cool. The ceiling fan runs counterclockwise, and sets the air in motion. The airflow creates a wind chill effect on your skin. Using a ceiling fan and air conditioning unit simultaneously allows you to raise your thermostat setting without a change in comfort. Winter Mode In winter, Westinghouse ceiling fans can be switched to the clockwise direction. As a result, the warm air that collects near the ceiling is distributed evenly throughout the room eliminating cold spots and drafts. Turn fans on only when using rooms in which they\u2019re located to dramatically increase your comfort level and decrease energy costs.
