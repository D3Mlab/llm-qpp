It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives. Developed by our in-house chemists, our formulations are proprietary, structural, and marine grade. These epoxies have set the standard for epoxy quality in the marine industry and beyond since 1969.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats. Many of the wood/epoxy construction techniques that have made modern wooden boats so successful can also be applied to the repair of older wooden boats with excellent results. Gougeon Brothers, Inc., the company that has been formulating and manufacturing WEST SYSTEM Epoxies since 1969. They pioneered the use of epoxy to enhance wood's natural structural properties. Ease of use, ready availability, safety and easy access to instructional materials makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy a great choice for wooden boat construction and repairs. Furniture & Crafts The Eat a Peach Tribute Guitar using marquetry skills and WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Whether you're creating a river table, casting jewelry and works of art, making high-end knives, repairing sporting equipment, creating sculptures for public spaces, designing cosplay props, or building or repairing musical instruments, WEST SYSTEM Epoxy is versatile and reliable. Woodworkers and creators of all kinds depend on WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Home Repairs & Improvements The detail work on this Victorian home was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Homeowners rely on WEST SYSTEM Epoxy because it's versatile, reliable, readily available, consistent, and offers excellent instructional materials. WEST SYSTEM customers have used it to create spiral staircases, grand entry columns, and cherry wood basins. They've used it to build fences, trellises, and planter boxes, and neighborhood mini-libraries that can withstand decades outdoors. And to repair everything from porches and wooden window sashes to fiberglass tub and shower surfaces. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy an ideal adhesive and coating for lasting home repairs.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth.

Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

Accurate Ratio & Proper Mixing Are Paramount To Successful Pours Impact Resistant & Superior Air Release Popular uses include river tables, embedding pictures or embedding solid objects into a desired surface, casting figurines, jewelry making and more. Because this is a thick pour epoxy resin, it cures very slowly. Cure times can be 36-48 hours depending on temperature, which is quite a bit longer compared to a coating epoxy like our Table Top & Bar Top Epoxy. Colored Epoxy Compatible How To Color Epoxy: Our epoxy mixes well with mica pigment powders for colored epoxy applications. River tables, resin art canvas and more may require tinted epoxy. Epoxy is not meant to be mixed with or poured over oil-based products. Do not pour over oil-based paint or stain.

However, epoxy is not flexible. River tables must be supported to prevent flexing which could cause cracking. *Do not pour over oil-based paint or stain. Common Question: My project is painted or stained with an oil based product, what can I do? A: You can apply a water based clear coat (must be water based). Once the water based clear coat has fully cured, you can apply the epoxy. If the clear coat leaves a shine/gloss you may want to scuff the surface to ensure the epoxy properly sticks. We recommend using 320 grit sandpaper. If you do sand, be sure to thoroughly clean the surface prior to applying the epoxy. We recommend using Isopropyl Alcohol 99% (be sure it is 99%) to clean. Some of the most common uses for our epoxy are outlined below. Penny Table Top Bottle Cap Project Encapsulation Project River Tables Live Edges Fake & Faux Water Customers are continually exploring new applications for epoxy. When in doubt, reach out to our technical support to assess the suitability of product for particular projects. Although most epoxies will yellow over time, some resist yellowing caused by exposure to ultraviolet light better than others. Our epoxy contains UV Inhibitors which help to resist yellowing. *Although our epoxy is UV resistant, which resists yellowing, we do not recommend leaving finished projects in direct sunlight or for permanent outdoor applications. Common Question: Can I use this on a table that will be outside on a covered patio? A: It is possible to leave the epoxy outdoors if not exposed to direct UV exposure. If the epoxy is exposed to direct UV, the epoxy can yellow. This will be more noticeable on white or lightly colored substrates/surface. We recommend exercising caution when considering use over white or light-colored surfaces. It is also important to consider temperature fluctuations. Materials such as metal and glass can expand and contract at a different rate from the epoxy. This could cause glass to crack or the epoxy to peel away from a metal surface.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener.

THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. .

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats. Many of the wood/epoxy construction techniques that have made modern wooden boats so successful can also be applied to the repair of older wooden boats with excellent results. Gougeon Brothers, Inc., the company that has been formulating and manufacturing WEST SYSTEM Epoxies since 1969. They pioneered the use of epoxy to enhance wood's natural structural properties. Ease of use, ready availability, safety and easy access to instructional materials makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy a great choice for wooden boat construction and repairs.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats. Many of the wood/epoxy construction techniques that have made modern wooden boats so successful can also be applied to the repair of older wooden boats with excellent results. Gougeon Brothers, Inc., the company that has been formulating and manufacturing WEST SYSTEM Epoxies since 1969. They pioneered the use of epoxy to enhance wood's natural structural properties.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats. Many of the wood/epoxy construction techniques that have made modern wooden boats so successful can also be applied to the repair of older wooden boats with excellent results. Gougeon Brothers, Inc., the company that has been formulating and manufacturing WEST SYSTEM Epoxies since 1969. They pioneered the use of epoxy to enhance wood's natural structural properties. Ease of use, ready availability, safety and easy access to instructional materials makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy a great choice for wooden boat construction and repairs.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It is a clear, pale yellow, low-viscosity liquid epoxy resin. Blended with hardener at the proper ratio, it cures to a hard, solid plastic with superior physical properties. Based on which hardener you choose, it cures at a wide range of temperatures. Once cured, it forms a high-strength solid that is functionally waterproof, and highly resistant to moisture. The West System 105B Epoxy Resin is designed to wet out and bond with wood fiber, fiberglass, and reinforcing fabrics. It also bonds well with a variety of metals when mixed at the proper ratio with a West System Epoxy hardener. No Strong Solvent Odor 105 Epoxy Resin is formulated without volatile solvents and does not shrink after curing. It has a relatively high flash point and no strong solvent odor, making it safer to work with than polyester or vinylester resins. Resin viscosity is approximately 1000 centipoise (cP) at 72-degree-F. Thickening Epoxy Modifying this epoxy with West System fillers creates an excellent structural adhesive or fairing compound. You choose the filler that suits your project. Epoxy thickened with adhesive (high-density) fillers makes structural bonds, bridges gaps, and fills voids. Epoxy thickened with fairing (low-density) fillers is easily sanded and shaped after it cures.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

At Incredible Solutions, we pride ourselves not only on a superior product but on dedicated and competent technical support. Whether this is your first resin art project or you are a seasoned epoxy pro, we have a quality product to offer. We provide detailed Instructions For Use with every kit as well as encourage users to reach out and ask questions specifically relating to their project. We are here to help! Easy To Use 2:1 By Volume Mixture . Accurate Ratio & Proper Mixing Are Paramount To Successful Pours Impact Resistant & Superior Air Release Popular uses include river tables, embedding pictures or embedding solid objects into a desired surface, casting figurines, jewelry making and more. Because this is a thick pour epoxy resin, it cures very slowly. Cure times can be 36-48 hours depending on temperature, which is quite a bit longer compared to a coating epoxy like our Table Top & Bar Top Epoxy. Colored Epoxy Compatible How To Color Epoxy: Our epoxy mixes well with mica pigment powders for colored epoxy applications. River tables, resin art canvas and more may require tinted epoxy. Epoxy is not meant to be mixed with or poured over oil-based products. Do not pour over oil-based paint or stain.

Knowledgable Technical Support helps plan and troubleshoot even the most complicated projects. Read more Read more High gloss, ultra clear finish makes our Pourable Plastic Epoxy Resin perfect for River Tables, Live Edge Tables, Jewelry, figurines, and other Castings. However, epoxy is not flexible. River tables must be supported to prevent flexing which could cause cracking. *Do not pour over oil-based paint or stain. Common Question: My project is painted or stained with an oil based product, what can I do? A: You can apply a water based clear coat (must be water based). Once the water based clear coat has fully cured, you can apply the epoxy. If the clear coat leaves a shine/gloss you may want to scuff the surface to ensure the epoxy properly sticks. We recommend using 320 grit sandpaper. If you do sand, be sure to thoroughly clean the surface prior to applying the epoxy. We recommend using Isopropyl Alcohol 99% (be sure it is 99%) to clean. Some of the most common uses for our epoxy are outlined below. Penny Table Top Bottle Cap Project Encapsulation Project River Tables Live Edges Fake & Faux Water Customers are continually exploring new applications for epoxy. When in doubt, reach out to our technical support to assess the suitability of product for particular projects. Although most epoxies will yellow over time, some resist yellowing caused by exposure to ultraviolet light better than others. Our epoxy contains UV Inhibitors which help to resist yellowing. *Although our epoxy is UV resistant, which resists yellowing, we do not recommend leaving finished projects in direct sunlight or for permanent outdoor applications. Common Question: Can I use this on a table that will be outside on a covered patio? A: It is possible to leave the epoxy outdoors if not exposed to direct UV exposure. If the epoxy is exposed to direct UV, the epoxy can yellow. This will be more noticeable on white or lightly colored substrates/surface. We recommend exercising caution when considering use over white or light-colored surfaces. It is also important to consider temperature fluctuations. Materials such as metal and glass can expand and contract at a different rate from the epoxy. This could cause glass to crack or the epoxy to peel away from a metal surface.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer.

That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

At Incredible Solutions, we pride ourselves not only on a superior product but on dedicated and competent technical support. Whether this is your first resin art project or you are a seasoned epoxy pro, we have a quality product to offer. We provide detailed Instructions For Use with every kit as well as encourage users to reach out and ask questions specifically relating to their project. We are here to help! Easy To Use 2:1 By Volume Mixture . Accurate Ratio & Proper Mixing Are Paramount To Successful Pours Impact Resistant & Superior Air Release Popular uses include river tables, embedding pictures or embedding solid objects into a desired surface, casting figurines, jewelry making and more. Because this is a thick pour epoxy resin, it cures very slowly. Cure times can be 36-48 hours depending on temperature, which is quite a bit longer compared to a coating epoxy like our Table Top & Bar Top Epoxy. Colored Epoxy Compatible How To Color Epoxy: Our epoxy mixes well with mica pigment powders for colored epoxy applications. River tables, resin art canvas and more may require tinted epoxy. Epoxy is not meant to be mixed with or poured over oil-based products. Do not pour over oil-based paint or stain.

However, epoxy is not flexible. River tables must be supported to prevent flexing which could cause cracking. *Do not pour over oil-based paint or stain. Common Question: My project is painted or stained with an oil based product, what can I do? A: You can apply a water based clear coat (must be water based). Once the water based clear coat has fully cured, you can apply the epoxy. If the clear coat leaves a shine/gloss you may want to scuff the surface to ensure the epoxy properly sticks. We recommend using 320 grit sandpaper. If you do sand, be sure to thoroughly clean the surface prior to applying the epoxy. We recommend using Isopropyl Alcohol 99% (be sure it is 99%) to clean. Some of the most common uses for our epoxy are outlined below. Penny Table Top Bottle Cap Project Encapsulation Project River Tables Live Edges Fake & Faux Water Customers are continually exploring new applications for epoxy. When in doubt, reach out to our technical support to assess the suitability of product for particular projects. Although most epoxies will yellow over time, some resist yellowing caused by exposure to ultraviolet light better than others. Our epoxy contains UV Inhibitors which help to resist yellowing. *Although our epoxy is UV resistant, which resists yellowing, we do not recommend leaving finished projects in direct sunlight or for permanent outdoor applications. Common Question: Can I use this on a table that will be outside on a covered patio? A: It is possible to leave the epoxy outdoors if not exposed to direct UV exposure. If the epoxy is exposed to direct UV, the epoxy can yellow. This will be more noticeable on white or lightly colored substrates/surface. We recommend exercising caution when considering use over white or light-colored surfaces. It is also important to consider temperature fluctuations. Materials such as metal and glass can expand and contract at a different rate from the epoxy. This could cause glass to crack or the epoxy to peel away from a metal surface.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made.

Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through.

COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy.

Because this is a thick pour epoxy resin, it cures very slowly. Cure times can be 36-48 hours depending on temperature, which is quite a bit longer compared to a coating epoxy like our Table Top & Bar Top Epoxy. Colored Epoxy Compatible How To Color Epoxy: Our epoxy mixes well with mica pigment powders for colored epoxy applications. River tables, resin art canvas and more may require tinted epoxy. Epoxy is not meant to be mixed with or poured over oil-based products. Do not pour over oil-based paint or stain.

However, epoxy is not flexible. River tables must be supported to prevent flexing which could cause cracking. *Do not pour over oil-based paint or stain. Common Question: My project is painted or stained with an oil based product, what can I do? A: You can apply a water based clear coat (must be water based). Once the water based clear coat has fully cured, you can apply the epoxy. If the clear coat leaves a shine/gloss you may want to scuff the surface to ensure the epoxy properly sticks. We recommend using 320 grit sandpaper. If you do sand, be sure to thoroughly clean the surface prior to applying the epoxy. We recommend using Isopropyl Alcohol 99% (be sure it is 99%) to clean. Some of the most common uses for our epoxy are outlined below. Penny Table Top Bottle Cap Project Encapsulation Project River Tables Live Edges Fake & Faux Water Customers are continually exploring new applications for epoxy. When in doubt, reach out to our technical support to assess the suitability of product for particular projects. Although most epoxies will yellow over time, some resist yellowing caused by exposure to ultraviolet light better than others. Our epoxy contains UV Inhibitors which help to resist yellowing. *Although our epoxy is UV resistant, which resists yellowing, we do not recommend leaving finished projects in direct sunlight or for permanent outdoor applications. Common Question: Can I use this on a table that will be outside on a covered patio? A: It is possible to leave the epoxy outdoors if not exposed to direct UV exposure. If the epoxy is exposed to direct UV, the epoxy can yellow. This will be more noticeable on white or lightly colored substrates/surface. We recommend exercising caution when considering use over white or light-colored surfaces. It is also important to consider temperature fluctuations. Materials such as metal and glass can expand and contract at a different rate from the epoxy. This could cause glass to crack or the epoxy to peel away from a metal surface.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.
