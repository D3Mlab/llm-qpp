As skin\u2019s natural ability to shed surface dead skin cells declines with age, dark spots and uneven tone become increasingly more visible, leaving skin looking older and more dull. Revitalift Bright Reveal consists of four unique products to complete your daily routine: Brightening Daily Facial Cleanser, Brightening Peel Pads, Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer, and Brightening Day Moisturizer with SPF 30. The products can be used alone, as an entire routine or implemented into your own skincare routine. However, newly revealed skin may be sensitive to sunlight.

Beyond wrinkles, dull, uneven tone can make skin look older. Daily UV exposure, aging and past acne marks can cause skin to overproduce skin darkening pigment below the surface. As skin\u2019s natural ability to shed surface dead skin cells declines with age, dark spots and uneven tone become increasingly more visible, leaving skin looking older and more dull. Revitalift Bright Reveal consists of four unique products to complete your daily routine: Brightening Daily Facial Cleanser, Brightening Peel Pads, Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer, and Brightening Day Moisturizer with SPF 30. The products can be used alone, as an entire routine or implemented into your own skincare routine. However, newly revealed skin may be sensitive to sunlight. Be sure to use Broad Spectrum protection.
