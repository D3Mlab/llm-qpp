It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way.

About Thule Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.

Fits Thule rack systems, round bars and most factory racks. Review The Thule 624 Force L Roof Box is a new addition in Thule's hard-shelled cargo carrier product line that features a winning combination of value and space, while still offering key conveniences important to every user. The roof box has a 13 cubic foot interior capacity, and utilizes AeroSkin technology that results in a durable and the aerodynamic shape. Additional features include: tool-free Quick-Grip mounting, oversized SecureLock, dual-side lid opening, and four size choices to fit the vehicle and hauling needs of different users. An affordable and dependable rack top cargo box option blending value and space options. View larger A Blend of Design, Convenience and Style The Thule Force Roof Box product line is designed from the ground up to provide users with a dependable and durable product that can be counted on to last for the long haul. It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way. Diamond-textured AeroSkin lid design decreases wind-resistance, producing a quieter ride, and perhaps improved MPG. View larger QuickGrip mounting knobs allow for box installation in minutes on virtually any rack configuration. View larger The convenience of hands-free access to gear from either side of the box . View larger Simple Quick-Grip Mounting Hardware and Varied Box Sizes Thule Force cargo boxes attach easily to roof racks via Quick-Grip knob hardware along raised grooves in the floor of the box. The tool-free mounting capability of Quick-Grip hardware, and the range of the box's floor grooves make installation of the box a snap, literally installing in less than 5 minutes in many applications. The downward/inward clamping mechanism of the Quick-Grip hardware also makes the Thule Force compatible with virtually any Thule rack system, and most factory racks. Finally, the Thule force does not skimp on style or stowage capacity. All versions of the box are designed exclusively in a sleek, low-profile matte black AeroSkin finish that complements any vehicle.

About Thule Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.

Fits Thule rack systems, round bars and most factory racks. Review The Thule 624 Force L Roof Box is a new addition in Thule's hard-shelled cargo carrier product line that features a winning combination of value and space, while still offering key conveniences important to every user. The roof box has a 13 cubic foot interior capacity, and utilizes AeroSkin technology that results in a durable and the aerodynamic shape. Additional features include: tool-free Quick-Grip mounting, oversized SecureLock, dual-side lid opening, and four size choices to fit the vehicle and hauling needs of different users. An affordable and dependable rack top cargo box option blending value and space options. View larger A Blend of Design, Convenience and Style The Thule Force Roof Box product line is designed from the ground up to provide users with a dependable and durable product that can be counted on to last for the long haul. It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way. Diamond-textured AeroSkin lid design decreases wind-resistance, producing a quieter ride, and perhaps improved MPG. View larger QuickGrip mounting knobs allow for box installation in minutes on virtually any rack configuration. View larger The convenience of hands-free access to gear from either side of the box . View larger Simple Quick-Grip Mounting Hardware and Varied Box Sizes Thule Force cargo boxes attach easily to roof racks via Quick-Grip knob hardware along raised grooves in the floor of the box. The tool-free mounting capability of Quick-Grip hardware, and the range of the box's floor grooves make installation of the box a snap, literally installing in less than 5 minutes in many applications. The downward/inward clamping mechanism of the Quick-Grip hardware also makes the Thule Force compatible with virtually any Thule rack system, and most factory racks. Finally, the Thule force does not skimp on style or stowage capacity. All versions of the box are designed exclusively in a sleek, low-profile matte black AeroSkin finish that complements any vehicle. The Thule Force 624 L version provides 13 cubic feet of storage space. All told, it is available in four different Thule size categories.

It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way.
