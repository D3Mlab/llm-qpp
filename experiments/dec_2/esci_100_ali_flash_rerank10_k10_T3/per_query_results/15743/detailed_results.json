Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his family's bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities. Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns over three-dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dick's son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and has products sold in more than a dozen countries around the world.

Swagman was one of the first companies worldwide to design and market a hitch style bike rack. Over the years, that small bike rack company based in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia grew to include numerous other ground breaking designs in the North American Bicycle, RV and Automobile markets. Amazon.com The XTC Cross-Country 2-Bike Rack is designed to make it easy to carry two bikes securely on your car's hitch with no risk of bike-on-car, or bike-on-bike damage. Thanks to a built-in anti-wobble device, the platform-style rack secures solidly to 2 or 1.25-inch hitches. To load the bikes, simply lift them into the wheel platforms, secure the wheels with the integrated wheel straps, and secure the grip arms over the frames. With push button ratcheting arms and sliding wheel platforms, the rack provides a custom fit for bikes with 20 to 29-inch wheels and can accommodate multiple frame types. The soft frame-friendly coating on the grip arms, ensures that your bikes' finishes remain unmarred. In comparison to roof mounted bike racks that generally require you to remove the bike's front wheel and hitch-mounted cradle carriers that don't support the bikes from the base, the XTC Cross-Country is easy to use and worry free. Whether your rack is fully loaded or not in use, the rack provides ready access to your car's trunk. The rack folds up for easy storage when not in use and the center arm folds down to allow access to the rear of vehicle without removing the rack. Built to last, the XTC Cross-Country 2-Bike Rack carries a limited lifetime warranty from Swagman. Please note: an optional locking hitch pin and 10-millimeter security cable can be used with this rack and are sold separately.

Swagman was one of the first companies worldwide to design and market a hitch style bike rack. Over the years, that small bike rack company based in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia grew to include numerous other ground breaking designs in the North American Bicycle, RV and Automobile markets. Amazon.com The XTC Cross-Country 2-Bike Rack is designed to make it easy to carry two bikes securely on your car's hitch with no risk of bike-on-car, or bike-on-bike damage. Thanks to a built-in anti-wobble device, the platform-style rack secures solidly to 2 or 1.25-inch hitches. To load the bikes, simply lift them into the wheel platforms, secure the wheels with the integrated wheel straps, and secure the grip arms over the frames. With push button ratcheting arms and sliding wheel platforms, the rack provides a custom fit for bikes with 20 to 29-inch wheels and can accommodate multiple frame types. The soft frame-friendly coating on the grip arms, ensures that your bikes' finishes remain unmarred.

Whether your rack is fully loaded or not in use, the rack provides ready access to your car's trunk. The rack folds up for easy storage when not in use and the center arm folds down to allow access to the rear of vehicle without removing the rack. Built to last, the XTC Cross-Country 2-Bike Rack carries a limited lifetime warranty from Swagman. Please note: an optional locking hitch pin and 10-millimeter security cable can be used with this rack and are sold separately.

Amazon.com Carry your bicycles securely and avoid the hassles of piled bikes or high threshold rooftop mounts, with the Allen Deluxe 4-Bike Hitch Mount Rack. Fitting vehicles with a 2-inch trailer hitch, the Allen Deluxe Hitch Mount Rack is both easy to operate and super secure for your bikes. Constructed out of steel with a durable black powder finish, the rack is built to last and is backed up by a lifetime warranty by Allen. The Allen rack boasts a patented tie-down system and individually cradles up to four bikes in the 22-inch carry arms. As easy to install as it is to use, the rack sets up in less than 5 minutes with a no-wobble bolt that holds it still within the hitch. When the rack is not in use, the carry arms quickly drop out of the way and fold down flat with a patented single pin mechanism and the rack tilts up to allow easy access to the lift gate.

Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his family's bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities. Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns over three-dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dick's son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and has products sold in more than a dozen countries around the world.

Fitting vehicles with a 2-inch trailer hitch, the Allen Deluxe Hitch Mount Rack is both easy to operate and super secure for your bikes. Constructed out of steel with a durable black powder finish, the rack is built to last and is backed up by a lifetime warranty by Allen. The Allen rack boasts a patented tie-down system and individually cradles up to four bikes in the 22-inch carry arms.

Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his family's bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities. Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns over three-dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dick's son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and has products sold in more than a dozen countries around the world.

Since its founding, the company has been committed to producing the highest-quality, easiest-to-use bike racks and bicycle-related products on the market. Allen, a onetime aerospace engineer, opened Allen Sports after building a prototype bike carrier in his Lincoln, Massachusetts shop in his free time. The first-ever trunk-mounted bicycle carrier made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding) was refined on weekend excursions to Cape Cod. Shortly afterward, Allen took his design to market, and by 1971 had established a national presence for his product. Today, the family-owned company owns more than three dozen patents, operates four warehouses nationally, six factories abroad, and sells products in countries around the world including USA, Mexico, Canada, and China.

Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his family's bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities. Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns over three-dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dick's son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and has products sold in more than a dozen countries around the world.

The first-ever trunk-mounted bicycle carrier made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding) was refined on weekend excursions to Cape Cod. Shortly afterward, Allen took his design to market, and by 1971 had established a national presence for his product. Today, the family-owned company owns more than three dozen patents, operates four warehouses nationally, six factories abroad, and sells products in countries around the world including USA, Mexico, Canada, and China.

Swagman was one of the first companies worldwide to design and market a hitch style bike rack. Over the years, that small bike rack company based in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia grew to include numerous other ground breaking designs in the North American Bicycle, RV and Automobile markets. Amazon.com The XTC Cross-Country 2-Bike Rack is designed to make it easy to carry two bikes securely on your car's hitch with no risk of bike-on-car, or bike-on-bike damage. Thanks to a built-in anti-wobble device, the platform-style rack secures solidly to 2 or 1.25-inch hitches. To load the bikes, simply lift them into the wheel platforms, secure the wheels with the integrated wheel straps, and secure the grip arms over the frames.

Since its founding, the company has been committed to producing the highest-quality, easiest-to-use bike racks and bicycle-related products on the market. Allen, a onetime aerospace engineer, opened Allen Sports after building a prototype bike carrier in his Lincoln, Massachusetts shop in his free time.

Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his family's bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities. Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns over three-dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dick's son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and has products sold in more than a dozen countries around the world.

Constructed out of steel with a durable black powder finish, the rack is built to last and is backed up by a lifetime warranty by Allen. The Allen rack boasts a patented tie-down system and individually cradles up to four bikes in the 22-inch carry arms.

Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his family's bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities. Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns over three-dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dick's son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and has products sold in more than a dozen countries around the world.
