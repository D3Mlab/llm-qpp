(1 Shoulder Clip Only)\tProduct Description The Problem: Carrying your rifle requires one or more hands Since the creation of the rifle we have continuously looked for a better way to carry it. The rifle sling was created to make carrying your rifle more comfortable for extended periods of time. For any of you who have ever carried a Rifle, Shotgun, or Muzzleloader with a sling, you know it is not as convenient as it should be. As you move the sling gradually works its way off of your shoulder. Because of this you may end up holding your rifle sling with your hands to keep it secure on your shoulder. This can be extremely annoying, especially if you need your hands to climb out, use your binoculars, use trekking poles, etc. You may have even experienced your rifle falling off of your shoulder and hitting the ground. This can be devastating to your rifle, your scope, or those that are around you. The last thing you want to do on a hunt is to have to validate your rifle scope is still sighted in properly after dropping it. This is why we created the Sling Saddle. Read more The Sling Saddle was created to allow you to carry your rifle hands free THE SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM The Shoulder Clip integrates directly into your existing backpack strap, Hydration pack strap, etc. after clipping it onto your pack, it will secure your rifle on your shoulder and solve the problem of it continually trying to fall off. ISN'T THE SHOULDER CLIP ENOUGH TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM? (Not included when you buy the Shoulder clip only) While the shoulder clip solves a major issue and helps to secure your rifle on your shoulder. It doesn't eliminate the movement of the rifle stock as you walk, run, climb, etc. The Belt Clip attaches easily to your belt, or to your backpack waist strap when you use our pack adapter (included). This secures your rifle at your hip and limits its overall movement. BEING HANDS FREE IS THE SOLUTION The Shoulder Clip and the belt clip combined limit the overall movement of your weapon.

(1 Shoulder Clip Only)\tProduct Description The Problem: Carrying your rifle requires one or more hands Since the creation of the rifle we have continuously looked for a better way to carry it. The rifle sling was created to make carrying your rifle more comfortable for extended periods of time. For any of you who have ever carried a Rifle, Shotgun, or Muzzleloader with a sling, you know it is not as convenient as it should be. As you move the sling gradually works its way off of your shoulder. Because of this you may end up holding your rifle sling with your hands to keep it secure on your shoulder. This can be extremely annoying, especially if you need your hands to climb out, use your binoculars, use trekking poles, etc. You may have even experienced your rifle falling off of your shoulder and hitting the ground.

As you move the sling gradually works its way off of your shoulder. Because of this you may end up holding your rifle sling with your hands to keep it secure on your shoulder. This can be extremely annoying, especially if you need your hands to climb out, use your binoculars, use trekking poles, etc. You may have even experienced your rifle falling off of your shoulder and hitting the ground.
