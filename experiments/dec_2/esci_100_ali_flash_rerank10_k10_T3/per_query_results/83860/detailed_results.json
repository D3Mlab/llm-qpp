It also helps the printer achieve a very high quality with 50 micron layer height. You can pause a print and change filament to print in multiple colors, too! You can print using the included cloud software, the included Dremel Digilab 3D Slicer for Windows or Mac, or your favorite 3D software that supports . gcode, . g or . g3drem files such as Cura, Simplify3D, Craftware, KISSlicer, Slic3r or Repetier, and the large 3D printer features a 6\" x 10\" x 6.7\" (402 cu in) build volume. The Dremel Slicer can be used to print multiple objects at a time, add supports, change layer height, change infill and even access advanced settings for the best prints.From the manufacturer A 3D Printer that fits your needs The Award Winning Dremel DigiLab 3D45 3D Printer This flagship printer is Dremel\u2019s 3rd generation and is engineered for anyone from a first-time user to advanced professional to operate. Backed by Dremel\u2019s lifetime support, the 3D45 is incredibly reliable and built for heavy usage. With easy-to-use features, a quick start guide, and everything you need in the box, you can go from unboxing to printing in minutes. Reliable Printing starts with the Extruder Designed for high quality and reliability, this is the engine that powers the 3D45 forward. The direct drive, all-metal extruder is clog resistant and delivers smooth 3D prints. This high-powered extruder heats up to 280\u00b0C for flexibility in different print materials. The Filament Run-out detection resumes printing where you left off when filament runs out. The Built-in automatic Leveling Sensor adds precision leveling for even more reliable printing. Heated Build Plate heats up to 100 degrees Celsius, allowing you to print different filament types, including PLA, PETG, ECO-ABS, and Nylon. Automated 9-Point Leveling Sensor detects any variation in the print bed and automatically accounts for it for more successful printing Built-in HD Camera for remote print monitoring. Watch how your print is progressing in real-time from a computer or mobile device. 4.5\" Full Color Touch Screen makes it easy and intuitive to navigate and operate the printer functions and settings Previous page Fully Enclosed Housing improves print quality while delivering a quiet operation environment.

From WIFI connectivity, an onboard streaming camera, smart sensors in the extruder, and an automated Z-homing build plate, this is how 3D printing is supposed to be. EASY TO CHANGE CONSUMABLES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY Our 3D printers and materials have been tested by the CDC NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) so you can breathe a little easier in your classroom or office. With the easy to replace Smart Extruder+ and Flex Build Plate maintenance is quick and easy. A front facing filament drawer lets you change out colors or material types without flipping your printer around. Read more MakerBot Print What is MakerBot Print? MakerBot Print is free software that optimizes and streamlines the 3D printing process for any workflow. It allows you to discover, prepare, manage, and share 3D prints. Native CAD Support Save time by importing native CAD files, like parts and assemblies. Reduce the number of files to manage, and eliminate the need to convert files to an STL format which prevents conversion errors. Optimized Printing Our new slicer algorithm automatically adjusts slice settings for your specific printer model, software version, and Smart Extruder type. The new print preview helps verify design details before printing, and includes rafts and supports break away more easily for a cleaner print surface. Cloud-Enabled Management Auto Arrange multiple build plates at once Improved Rafts for cleaner prints Redesigned Breakaway Supports Read more MakerBot Smart Extruder+ Ease of Use, Reliability, and Superior Results with MakerBot PLA Filament.

It has an assisted level sensor on its magnetic extruder assembly, allowing easy changes to the Z offset in the menu for easy and perfect first layers. Wiring is no issue, as all of the components are already prewired and ready to go, with the connections hidden in the cable management sleeve. Most importantly, prints are crisp and clean. EASILY ACCESSIBLE MAGNETIC EXTRUDER The removable magnetic carriage provides an easy launch point for changing to an extruder system of your choice. Working on your machine is more convenient than ever. 2 SCREW HOTEND REMOVAL Access to your hot end is easy, making quick changes to the tool head possible. Switch from a 0. 4mm to a 0. 6mm nozzle without the hassle of actually changing the nozzle. Quick, convenient, and easy. HEATED, REMOVABLE, & FLEXIBLE PRINT BED Capable of easily hitting 100C, this large 300 x 300 print bed makes removing prints easier than ever. The magnetic platform also makes cleaning and removing the bed itself simple and straightforward. ASSISTED BED LEVEL SENSOR Leveling is easy with the level sensor. It will detect differences in the bed, which allows you to set an accurate Z offset to make first layers a breeze. DUAL Y GANTRY The dual Y gantry provides a stable base for the print bed, minimizing wobble found in simple Y gantry models of 3D printers. This results in cleaner prints and prevents the need to level over and over again.

Read more Tips about Levelling If you happened to receive a severely bowed bed plate after unboxing, please reach our support team for a replacement. If it is a slight curve (\u00b10.2mm), you could manage to fix it through the following steps. Adjust the bed step-by-step according to the User Manual (see page 20).
