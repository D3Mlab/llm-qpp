Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Please note, it may take 5-7 minutes to feel the heat. My product is not turning on or no longer works. What should I do? Make sure your product's cord connection is secure as it should snap (*clicks*) into place.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

How can I order one? We can provide you with a new cover, power adapter or sleeve for free! No cost to you. Is this cordless and rechargeable? No, this version is NOT rechargeable. It needs to be plugged in with the included power adapter for it to power on. For our rechargeable version, search \"Zyllion ZMA-13RB.\" I work from home and in the office, is there a way to secure the massager onto my chair? Yes, the massager has adjustable Velcro straps located on the back of the massager. Wrap the straps around the back of your chair and secure with the Velcro. Now you can enjoy a hands-free massage while you work. My product does not heat up as much as I'd like. Is it possible to make it hotter? Unfortunately not. Since friction from the mesh combined with the heat function can create more heat sensitivity, we've erred on the side of caution to ensure our customers are safe. Please note, it may take 5-7 minutes to feel the heat. My product is not turning on or no longer works. What should I do? Make sure your product's cord connection is secure as it should snap (*clicks*) into place. We also recommend using the car adapter and if it powers on, we can provide you with a new replacement power adapter at no cost to you.\n\n1194940: AMEISEYE Handheld Massager Deep Tissue Cellulite Electric Body Massager with 3 Massage Heads\tProduct Description Product Features: This body sculpting machine unique oscillating feature penetrates deeply into the inner layers of skin for muscle toning and deep tissue massage.360 degree off centered axis design oscillates over 2500 times per minute will help you relax stiff muscles effectively.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car).

For our rechargeable version, search \"Zyllion ZMA-13RB.\" I work from home and in the office, is there a way to secure the massager onto my chair? Yes, the massager has adjustable Velcro straps located on the back of the massager. Wrap the straps around the back of your chair and secure with the Velcro. Now you can enjoy a hands-free massage while you work. My product does not heat up as much as I'd like. Is it possible to make it hotter? Unfortunately not. Since friction from the mesh combined with the heat function can create more heat sensitivity, we've erred on the side of caution to ensure our customers are safe. Please note, it may take 5-7 minutes to feel the heat. My product is not turning on or no longer works. What should I do? Make sure your product's cord connection is secure as it should snap (*clicks*) into place.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Now you can enjoy a hands-free massage while you work. My product does not heat up as much as I'd like. Is it possible to make it hotter? Unfortunately not. Since friction from the mesh combined with the heat function can create more heat sensitivity, we've erred on the side of caution to ensure our customers are safe. Please note, it may take 5-7 minutes to feel the heat. My product is not turning on or no longer works. What should I do? Make sure your product's cord connection is secure as it should snap (*clicks*) into place.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Please note, it may take 5-7 minutes to feel the heat. My product is not turning on or no longer works. What should I do? Make sure your product's cord connection is secure as it should snap (*clicks*) into place.
