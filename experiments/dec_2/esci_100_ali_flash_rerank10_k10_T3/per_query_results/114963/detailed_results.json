Next page Product Description The Best For Meal Prep Part of successful meal prep is having a grown-up carrier that\u2019s multi-functional and built to travel. ThinkFit\u2019s bags are specifically designed for meal prep so you can let go of your kids lunch box and retire the old plastic grocery bags you\u2019ve been making due with. You and your meals deserve this upgrade. Perfect For Work ThinkFit\u2019s bag design bridges the gap between home and work. It has everything needed to get your meals safely into the office without spilling or spoiling your car, clothes, or work materials during the commute and the bag doubles as a cooler if your office or work-site lacks a fridge. Great for long shifts and travel. At The Gym Making it to the gym as a part of your wellness routine? Our meal prep system comes with a unique shaker cup, supplement dispensers, and extra pockets to hold your keys, phone, wallet, and anything else you might need while you are at the gym. We keep it in reach so you can keep reaching for those gains. Read more 2 XL Ice Packs With our heavy-duty XL ice packs, 2 included with each bag , you can keep your prepped meals at a safe temperature for us to 12 hours in a temperate environment; an essential feature for those that are in the car all day, out at a work site, or just trying to avoid the horror that is a shared office fridge. 6 BPA Free Containers We\u2019ve taken the guesswork out of portion control for you, each bag comes standard with two 1.5 cup capacity containers and four 2.5 cup capacity containers. In addition, ThinkFit's BPA Free Containers are microwave, freezer, dishwasher safe and come standard with snap lock lids and silicone seals to maintain freshness and reduce spoilage. 23oz Innovative Shaker Cup The BPA free shaker bottle has 3 storage containers that screw onto the bottom of the bottle. Load up your pre-workout and protein in the bottom compartments, and then easily add them into your shaker bottle when you\u2019re ready. The stainless steel whisk attachment, superior to standard spheres, ensures complete mixing. 7 Day Pill Dispenser Prefer to take your supplements and vitamins during your meals? With our smart supplement pill box you can bring them on the go and have them available at all times. The dispenser has 7 compartments, a clear lid for easy identification, and a push-button activated carousel for quick dispensing.

Adjustable Shoulder Strap We include our 48\u201d inch adjustable shoulder strap that makes carrying around a ThinkFit meal prep bag simple, streamlined, and most importantly - comfortable. The shoulder strap is also removable if you prefer to use the grab and go handle! Heavy Duty YKK Zippers Zippers are a common weak point for meal prep bags, failing to hold up to the daily use that\u2019s expected. YKK zippers, prized in the garment industry, are known for their durability, high-quality construction, and long-lasting quality. That\u2019s why our ThinkFit bags come standard with them for both the main compartment and side pocket to make sure you can use and enjoy your bag for years to come.

Next page Product Description The Best For Meal Prep Part of successful meal prep is having a grown-up carrier that\u2019s multi-functional and built to travel. ThinkFit\u2019s bags are specifically designed for meal prep so you can let go of your kids lunch box and retire the old plastic grocery bags you\u2019ve been making due with. You and your meals deserve this upgrade. Perfect For Work ThinkFit\u2019s bag design bridges the gap between home and work. It has everything needed to get your meals safely into the office without spilling or spoiling your car, clothes, or work materials during the commute and the bag doubles as a cooler if your office or work-site lacks a fridge. Great for long shifts and travel. At The Gym Making it to the gym as a part of your wellness routine? Our meal prep system comes with a unique shaker cup, supplement dispensers, and extra pockets to hold your keys, phone, wallet, and anything else you might need while you are at the gym. We keep it in reach so you can keep reaching for those gains. Read more 2 XL Ice Packs With our heavy-duty XL ice packs, 2 included with each bag , you can keep your prepped meals at a safe temperature for us to 12 hours in a temperate environment; an essential feature for those that are in the car all day, out at a work site, or just trying to avoid the horror that is a shared office fridge. 6 BPA Free Containers We\u2019ve taken the guesswork out of portion control for you, each bag comes standard with two 1.5 cup capacity containers and four 2.5 cup capacity containers. In addition, ThinkFit's BPA Free Containers are microwave, freezer, dishwasher safe and come standard with snap lock lids and silicone seals to maintain freshness and reduce spoilage. 23oz Innovative Shaker Cup The BPA free shaker bottle has 3 storage containers that screw onto the bottom of the bottle.

YKK zippers, prized in the garment industry, are known for their durability, high-quality construction, and long-lasting quality. That\u2019s why our ThinkFit bags come standard with them for both the main compartment and side pocket to make sure you can use and enjoy your bag for years to come.

Product innovation and firsthand experience in the field continue to be our basis of expansion into designing ultra-durable and portable soft coolers, insulated drinkware, waterproof and everyday bags and backpacks, dog bowls and beds, and other outdoor gear, each with its own line of accessories. Every YETI product performs when it matters most\u2014whether that be a trip into the remote Alaskan wilderness, chasing tarpon on the Florida coast, even just in the backyard with friends.\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\n***\n\nOutput only your reformulated query:"

It has everything needed to get your meals safely into the office without spilling or spoiling your car, clothes, or work materials during the commute and the bag doubles as a cooler if your office or work-site lacks a fridge. Great for long shifts and travel. At The Gym Making it to the gym as a part of your wellness routine?

ThinkFit\u2019s bags are specifically designed for meal prep so you can let go of your kids lunch box and retire the old plastic grocery bags you\u2019ve been making due with. You and your meals deserve this upgrade. Perfect For Work ThinkFit\u2019s bag design bridges the gap between home and work. It has everything needed to get your meals safely into the office without spilling or spoiling your car, clothes, or work materials during the commute and the bag doubles as a cooler if your office or work-site lacks a fridge. Great for long shifts and travel. At The Gym Making it to the gym as a part of your wellness routine?

Next page Product Description The Best For Meal Prep Part of successful meal prep is having a grown-up carrier that\u2019s multi-functional and built to travel. ThinkFit\u2019s bags are specifically designed for meal prep so you can let go of your kids lunch box and retire the old plastic grocery bags you\u2019ve been making due with. You and your meals deserve this upgrade. Perfect For Work ThinkFit\u2019s bag design bridges the gap between home and work. It has everything needed to get your meals safely into the office without spilling or spoiling your car, clothes, or work materials during the commute and the bag doubles as a cooler if your office or work-site lacks a fridge. Great for long shifts and travel. At The Gym Making it to the gym as a part of your wellness routine? Our meal prep system comes with a unique shaker cup, supplement dispensers, and extra pockets to hold your keys, phone, wallet, and anything else you might need while you are at the gym. We keep it in reach so you can keep reaching for those gains.

In addition, ThinkFit's BPA Free Containers are microwave, freezer, dishwasher safe and come standard with snap lock lids and silicone seals to maintain freshness and reduce spoilage. 23oz Innovative Shaker Cup The BPA free shaker bottle has 3 storage containers that screw onto the bottom of the bottle.

ThinkFit\u2019s bags are specifically designed for meal prep so you can let go of your kids lunch box and retire the old plastic grocery bags you\u2019ve been making due with. You and your meals deserve this upgrade. Perfect For Work ThinkFit\u2019s bag design bridges the gap between home and work. It has everything needed to get your meals safely into the office without spilling or spoiling your car, clothes, or work materials during the commute and the bag doubles as a cooler if your office or work-site lacks a fridge. Great for long shifts and travel. At The Gym Making it to the gym as a part of your wellness routine? Our meal prep system comes with a unique shaker cup, supplement dispensers, and extra pockets to hold your keys, phone, wallet, and anything else you might need while you are at the gym. We keep it in reach so you can keep reaching for those gains.
