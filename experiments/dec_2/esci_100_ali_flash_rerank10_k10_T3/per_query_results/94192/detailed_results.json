It is often associated with northern shamans and immersion in a alternative state of consciousness. Many people notice that playing the harp helps them relax, escape from the daily routine and enter a state of light trance. The harp, like no other instrument, is great for improvising a expirementing with various sounds. The mouth harp by MUARO is a great way to introduce yourself to the world of music and improvisation! AUTHENTIC CASE This mouth harp comes with a protective case to store it and carry it with you while you are traveling or on the go. The case has a cord attached to it so you can hang it on your wrist. The case is crafted from cedar and the cord from premium leather. HIGH QUALITY All our mouth harps are made of high-quality materials, like steel and brass, to ensure that they will stand the test of time. ORIGINAL SOUND Limitless new sounds: our mouth harp is specifically designed to produce clear and crisp sounds! Depending on your breathing technique and movement, it can produce a unique variety of melodies. Read more MASTERING THE SOUND By hitting the tongue with your fingers, you create vibrations that are transmitted to the oral cavity, which serves as a resonator: by changing its contour, you can achieve a different timbral color of the sound of the instrument. The frame to which the tongue is attached is designed to fix the instrument in front of the teeth playing with the fingers of the other hand. The harp should be pressed tightly against the front teeth, but there should be a gap between the teeth that allows the tongue of the instrument to pass freely.

Reinvented art brings new life to this deceptively simple game. An easy-to-learn party game of bluffing, deducing and strategy. You must bluff, lie and pierce through the deceptions to expose the roses. Be wary, though - if you happen across a skull, the consequences are dire! Read more Players will hold three rose cards and one skull. Add a card to the pile in front of you and when you feel lucky, announce your challenge and declare how many cards you will flip. Cards that show a rose are safe, but if you expose your opponent's hidden skull, you lose one of your own cards. Practice your bluffing skills by trying to catch other players with your skull. Keep your cards to the bitter end to win this clever game of deception and perception!

It is often associated with northern shamans and immersion in a alternative state of consciousness. Many people notice that playing the harp helps them relax, escape from the daily routine and enter a state of light trance. The harp, like no other instrument, is great for improvising a expirementing with various sounds. The mouth harp by MUARO is a great way to introduce yourself to the world of music and improvisation! AUTHENTIC CASE This mouth harp comes with a protective case to store it and carry it with you while you are traveling or on the go. The case has a cord attached to it so you can hang it on your wrist. The case is crafted from cedar and the cord from premium leather. HIGH QUALITY All our mouth harps are made of high-quality materials, like steel and brass, to ensure that they will stand the test of time. ORIGINAL SOUND Limitless new sounds: our mouth harp is specifically designed to produce clear and crisp sounds! Depending on your breathing technique and movement, it can produce a unique variety of melodies. Read more MASTERING THE SOUND By hitting the tongue with your fingers, you create vibrations that are transmitted to the oral cavity, which serves as a resonator: by changing its contour, you can achieve a different timbral color of the sound of the instrument. The frame to which the tongue is attached is designed to fix the instrument in front of the teeth playing with the fingers of the other hand. The harp should be pressed tightly against the front teeth, but there should be a gap between the teeth that allows the tongue of the instrument to pass freely.

The side impact protection sets it apart from its competitors and makes it arguably the safest climbing helmet ever brought to market. Integrated hearing protection with low-profile design (no prominent parts to get caught on branches). \"Swept back\" design of the helmet allows for optimal field of view. The adjustable pressure fitting of the hearing protectors allows for a perfect fit. Even weight distribution design and the adjustable neck piece allow for a perfect, secure and comfortable fit, even without the chin strap. Adjustable vent flow on helmet (vents can be opened or closed) allows for use in wet, hot or cold work conditions. Discrete channel for the chin strap was designed to prevent the chin strap from slipping under the ear protector. Extraordinary wicking of perspiration via large and exchangeable pads with Klima-AIR technology. All functions of the helmet (hearing protection, face shield, helmet adjustment, and helmet vents) can be activated with just two fingers... making operation of the helmet easy. One of the only arborist helmets offering side and rear impact protection. Designed over a 15 year period with two things in mind: total head protection and working arborists. Includes chinstrap for work aloft. Certified to EN397 and EN 12492.\n\n890110: HAIREALM 26\" Mannequin Head Hair Styling Training Head Manikin Cosmetology Doll Head Synthetic Fiber Hair (Table Clamp Stand Included) SACH2P\tProduct Description Hairealm Limited specializes in various hair series products such as mannequin head, makeup head, canvas head, bald head and other hairdressing tools.

It is often associated with northern shamans and immersion in a alternative state of consciousness. Many people notice that playing the harp helps them relax, escape from the daily routine and enter a state of light trance. The harp, like no other instrument, is great for improvising a expirementing with various sounds. The mouth harp by MUARO is a great way to introduce yourself to the world of music and improvisation! AUTHENTIC CASE This mouth harp comes with a protective case to store it and carry it with you while you are traveling or on the go. The case has a cord attached to it so you can hang it on your wrist. The case is crafted from cedar and the cord from premium leather. HIGH QUALITY All our mouth harps are made of high-quality materials, like steel and brass, to ensure that they will stand the test of time. ORIGINAL SOUND Limitless new sounds: our mouth harp is specifically designed to produce clear and crisp sounds! Depending on your breathing technique and movement, it can produce a unique variety of melodies. Read more MASTERING THE SOUND By hitting the tongue with your fingers, you create vibrations that are transmitted to the oral cavity, which serves as a resonator: by changing its contour, you can achieve a different timbral color of the sound of the instrument. The frame to which the tongue is attached is designed to fix the instrument in front of the teeth playing with the fingers of the other hand. The harp should be pressed tightly against the front teeth, but there should be a gap between the teeth that allows the tongue of the instrument to pass freely.

The harp, like no other instrument, is great for improvising a expirementing with various sounds. The mouth harp by MUARO is a great way to introduce yourself to the world of music and improvisation! AUTHENTIC CASE This mouth harp comes with a protective case to store it and carry it with you while you are traveling or on the go. The case has a cord attached to it so you can hang it on your wrist. The case is crafted from cedar and the cord from premium leather. HIGH QUALITY All our mouth harps are made of high-quality materials, like steel and brass, to ensure that they will stand the test of time. ORIGINAL SOUND Limitless new sounds: our mouth harp is specifically designed to produce clear and crisp sounds! Depending on your breathing technique and movement, it can produce a unique variety of melodies. Read more MASTERING THE SOUND By hitting the tongue with your fingers, you create vibrations that are transmitted to the oral cavity, which serves as a resonator: by changing its contour, you can achieve a different timbral color of the sound of the instrument. The frame to which the tongue is attached is designed to fix the instrument in front of the teeth playing with the fingers of the other hand. The harp should be pressed tightly against the front teeth, but there should be a gap between the teeth that allows the tongue of the instrument to pass freely.
