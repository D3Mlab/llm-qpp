PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

Step 1 Measure your table. There is a simple calculation you can use to determine the measurements of your tablecloth. To start, you'll need to know the measurements of your table. For a rectangular or square-shaped table, use a measuring tape to measure your table's length and width. For a round table, you'll need to measure the diameter of your table. A diameter is the straight line going through the center of a circle. Step 2 Calculate the proper size for a square or rectangle table. If you have a rectangular table, you'll need to know your desired drop. Remember, this depends on the type of event you're planning. To start, add twice the desired drop to both the length and width of the table. For example, say your table is 48 inches wide and 72 inches long. You want a 6-inch drop. You would add 12 to 48, to get 60. You would then add 12 to 72, to get 84. The resulting values are the dimensions of the tablecloth you should aim to purchase. In our above example, you should look for a tablecloth that is 60 X 84 inches. Step 3 Figure out the size for a round table. Calculating the dimensions of a round table is somewhat simpler. To figure out your length, you simply add twice your desired drop by your table's diameter. Say you want a 5-inch drop and your table has a diameter of 50 inches. You would add 10 to 50, getting 60. When purchasing a tablecloth, select a 60-inch round tablecloth.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.\n\n715188: Expanded PVC Sheet \u2013 Lightweight Rigid Foam \u2013 3mm (1/8 inch) \u2013 24 x 48 inches \u2013 White \u2013 Ideal for Signage, Displays, and Digital/Screen Printing\tProduct Description All of our dimensions are NOMINAL.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

Step 1 Measure your table. There is a simple calculation you can use to determine the measurements of your tablecloth. To start, you'll need to know the measurements of your table. For a rectangular or square-shaped table, use a measuring tape to measure your table's length and width. For a round table, you'll need to measure the diameter of your table. A diameter is the straight line going through the center of a circle. Step 2 Calculate the proper size for a square or rectangle table. If you have a rectangular table, you'll need to know your desired drop. Remember, this depends on the type of event you're planning. To start, add twice the desired drop to both the length and width of the table. For example, say your table is 48 inches wide and 72 inches long. You want a 6-inch drop. You would add 12 to 48, to get 60. You would then add 12 to 72, to get 84. The resulting values are the dimensions of the tablecloth you should aim to purchase. In our above example, you should look for a tablecloth that is 60 X 84 inches. Step 3 Figure out the size for a round table. Calculating the dimensions of a round table is somewhat simpler. To figure out your length, you simply add twice your desired drop by your table's diameter. Say you want a 5-inch drop and your table has a diameter of 50 inches. You would add 10 to 50, getting 60. When purchasing a tablecloth, select a 60-inch round tablecloth.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation.

Step 1 Measure your table. There is a simple calculation you can use to determine the measurements of your tablecloth. To start, you'll need to know the measurements of your table. For a rectangular or square-shaped table, use a measuring tape to measure your table's length and width. For a round table, you'll need to measure the diameter of your table. A diameter is the straight line going through the center of a circle. Step 2 Calculate the proper size for a square or rectangle table. If you have a rectangular table, you'll need to know your desired drop. Remember, this depends on the type of event you're planning. To start, add twice the desired drop to both the length and width of the table. For example, say your table is 48 inches wide and 72 inches long. You want a 6-inch drop. You would add 12 to 48, to get 60. You would then add 12 to 72, to get 84. The resulting values are the dimensions of the tablecloth you should aim to purchase. In our above example, you should look for a tablecloth that is 60 X 84 inches. Step 3 Figure out the size for a round table. Calculating the dimensions of a round table is somewhat simpler. To figure out your length, you simply add twice your desired drop by your table's diameter. Say you want a 5-inch drop and your table has a diameter of 50 inches. You would add 10 to 50, getting 60. When purchasing a tablecloth, select a 60-inch round tablecloth.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.

Step 1 Measure your table. There is a simple calculation you can use to determine the measurements of your tablecloth. To start, you'll need to know the measurements of your table. For a rectangular or square-shaped table, use a measuring tape to measure your table's length and width. For a round table, you'll need to measure the diameter of your table. A diameter is the straight line going through the center of a circle. Step 2 Calculate the proper size for a square or rectangle table. If you have a rectangular table, you'll need to know your desired drop. Remember, this depends on the type of event you're planning. To start, add twice the desired drop to both the length and width of the table. For example, say your table is 48 inches wide and 72 inches long. You want a 6-inch drop. You would add 12 to 48, to get 60. You would then add 12 to 72, to get 84. The resulting values are the dimensions of the tablecloth you should aim to purchase. In our above example, you should look for a tablecloth that is 60 X 84 inches. Step 3 Figure out the size for a round table. Calculating the dimensions of a round table is somewhat simpler. To figure out your length, you simply add twice your desired drop by your table's diameter. Say you want a 5-inch drop and your table has a diameter of 50 inches. You would add 10 to 50, getting 60. When purchasing a tablecloth, select a 60-inch round tablecloth.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, is a durable plastic that provides an excellent balance of strength and weight, and is typically resistant to acids, alkalis, and most other inorganic chemicals. The material is also dimensionally stable, due in part to its low moisture absorption. Plastic refers to a group of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have been engineered to achieve specific properties. The most notable characteristics of plastics are its low weight, machinability, corrosion resistance, and typically good thermal and electrical insulating properties. Certain plastic grades also offer optical transparency similar to glass, low-friction or self-lubricating surfaces, and exceptional impact resistance. Depending on their properties, certain plastic grades can be used as alternatives to metal, glass, and ceramic. Unlike metal, plastic may experience creep, which is deformation caused by longtime exposure to a constant load. Tensile strength, used to indicate the material\u2019s overall strength, is the peak stress it can withstand before it breaks. Corrosion resistance describes the material's ability to prevent deterioration caused by atmosphere, moisture, or other medium. Wear resistance indicates the ability to prevent surface damage caused by contact with other surfaces. Toughness describes the material's ability to absorb energy before breaking, while hardness (commonly measured as indentation hardness) describes its resistance to permanent surface deformation. Impact resistance is the measure of a material\u2019s ability to absorb a shock of energy before breaking.
