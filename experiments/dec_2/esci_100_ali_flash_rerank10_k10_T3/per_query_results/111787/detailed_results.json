We recommend applying Glass Plus to a cool surface, out of direct sunlight. Re-spray entire surface and re-wipe with a paper towel or lint-free cloth.

We recommend applying Glass Plus to a cool surface, out of direct sunlight. Re-spray entire surface and re-wipe with a paper towel or lint-free cloth.

We recommend applying Glass Plus to a cool surface, out of direct sunlight. Re-spray entire surface and re-wipe with a paper towel or lint-free cloth.

We recommend applying Glass Plus to a cool surface, out of direct sunlight. Re-spray entire surface and re-wipe with a paper towel or lint-free cloth.
