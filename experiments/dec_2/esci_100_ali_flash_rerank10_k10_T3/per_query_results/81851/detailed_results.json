We currently offer thousands of different parts and accessories on our website, all designed to make your ride better. So you could say we have a little experience when it comes to giving off-roaders what they want. SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too. Next page Product Description Replaces OEM Part #: 2202015 3235500 3235616 FEATURES Heavy-Duty U-Series U-Joint Direct Polaris OEM replacement needle bearing U-joint Twice as strong as stock For riders that are tired of breaking weak OEM U-joints 4340 chromoly steel body 3-month replacement against breakage Polaris Heavy Duty Replacement U-Joint Bigger, Better U-Joints We were tired of blowing U-joints and ruining our ride, that\u2019s why we built better, stronger U-joints that can handle the power of any Polaris UTV or ATV. Our heavy-duty U-joint is twice as strong as stock. Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts. Heavy-Duty U-Series: A Super Strong U-Joint Upgrade We make our replacement Heavy-Duty U-joint with 4340 chromoly steel whereas stock is made from plain carbon steel. That change alone makes our U-joint twice as strong as stock, so you can count on it to keep you going. You\u2019ll get that confidence back to drive harder and keep the pedal down longer without worrying about damaging your drive-train or prop shaft.

It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts.

SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

Our heavy-duty U-joint is twice as strong as stock. Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts. Heavy-Duty U-Series: A Super Strong U-Joint Upgrade We make our replacement Heavy-Duty U-joint with 4340 chromoly steel whereas stock is made from plain carbon steel. That change alone makes our U-joint twice as strong as stock, so you can count on it to keep you going. You\u2019ll get that confidence back to drive harder and keep the pedal down longer without worrying about damaging your drive-train or prop shaft.

SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts.

And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

We currently offer thousands of different parts and accessories on our website, all designed to make your ride better. So you could say we have a little experience when it comes to giving off-roaders what they want. SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too. Next page Product Description Replaces OEM Part #: 2202015 3235500 3235616 FEATURES Heavy-Duty U-Series U-Joint Direct Polaris OEM replacement needle bearing U-joint Twice as strong as stock For riders that are tired of breaking weak OEM U-joints 4340 chromoly steel body 3-month replacement against breakage Polaris Heavy Duty Replacement U-Joint Bigger, Better U-Joints We were tired of blowing U-joints and ruining our ride, that\u2019s why we built better, stronger U-joints that can handle the power of any Polaris UTV or ATV. Our heavy-duty U-joint is twice as strong as stock. Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts. Heavy-Duty U-Series: A Super Strong U-Joint Upgrade We make our replacement Heavy-Duty U-joint with 4340 chromoly steel whereas stock is made from plain carbon steel. That change alone makes our U-joint twice as strong as stock, so you can count on it to keep you going. You\u2019ll get that confidence back to drive harder and keep the pedal down longer without worrying about damaging your drive-train or prop shaft.

And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

Our heavy-duty U-joint is twice as strong as stock. Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts. Heavy-Duty U-Series: A Super Strong U-Joint Upgrade We make our replacement Heavy-Duty U-joint with 4340 chromoly steel whereas stock is made from plain carbon steel. That change alone makes our U-joint twice as strong as stock, so you can count on it to keep you going. You\u2019ll get that confidence back to drive harder and keep the pedal down longer without worrying about damaging your drive-train or prop shaft.

And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

Suspension Products Road Armor Road Armor helps you say goodbye to uncomfortable rides.

We currently offer thousands of different parts and accessories on our website, all designed to make your ride better. So you could say we have a little experience when it comes to giving off-roaders what they want. SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

Our heavy-duty U-joint is twice as strong as stock. Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts. Heavy-Duty U-Series: A Super Strong U-Joint Upgrade We make our replacement Heavy-Duty U-joint with 4340 chromoly steel whereas stock is made from plain carbon steel. That change alone makes our U-joint twice as strong as stock, so you can count on it to keep you going. You\u2019ll get that confidence back to drive harder and keep the pedal down longer without worrying about damaging your drive-train or prop shaft.

SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

We currently offer thousands of different parts and accessories on our website, all designed to make your ride better. So you could say we have a little experience when it comes to giving off-roaders what they want. SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too. Next page Product Description Replaces OEM Part #: 2202015 3235500 3235616 FEATURES Heavy-Duty U-Series U-Joint Direct Polaris OEM replacement needle bearing U-joint Twice as strong as stock For riders that are tired of breaking weak OEM U-joints 4340 chromoly steel body 3-month replacement against breakage Polaris Heavy Duty Replacement U-Joint Bigger, Better U-Joints We were tired of blowing U-joints and ruining our ride, that\u2019s why we built better, stronger U-joints that can handle the power of any Polaris UTV or ATV. Our heavy-duty U-joint is twice as strong as stock. Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts. Heavy-Duty U-Series: A Super Strong U-Joint Upgrade We make our replacement Heavy-Duty U-joint with 4340 chromoly steel whereas stock is made from plain carbon steel.

SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.

SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too.
