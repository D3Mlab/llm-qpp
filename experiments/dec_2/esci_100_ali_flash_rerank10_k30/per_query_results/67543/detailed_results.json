Sharp & Classy My son is 5'11, 205lbs . Chose an XL with plenty of room . Mostly worried about the length which was perfect. A large might have worked for him. We tighted with the slide buckle on the back. He used the vest for a Roaring 20s themed dance at school , but this classy look he will use again for any event he needs the wear a tie for. The vest is all one piece and is very nice and made well. I recommend it Great piece for a costume or night out I ordered this for an event costume . Ordered a small for a tall thin boy. Perfect fit. This will be used for performance . I\u2019m 178 cm and 79 kg . Size on picture is Large . Good value for money. Will purcase again. GREAT DESIGN FOR WARM WEATHER AND GREATER ARM MOVEMENT This is the best design I have ever worn, it is a one piece vest and sleeveless \u201cappearing \u201c suit coat. It was so much cooler for a 90 degree outdoor wedding than a full 3 piece suite. The best was being able to have full range of motion for full arm reaching with no pulling or tightness. It washes great and only needs a quick light drying. The lapels give the appearance of a formal tux or suit. The compliments were great, I was asked we\u2019re I got it from and couldn\u2019t believe the low cost for a must have highly recommended unique addition to any guys closet. This looks great on any age and fits perfectly to scale. I am looking for other colors it may come in. Very sharp and perfect for that special occasion It came good with my blue suits.

Sam Rosenberg wanted to have his own successful business before he retired. Earlier in his adulthood he experienced a few failed start ups. Fun World started out working with factories in Japan and then moved to Korea and Taiwan and Hong Kong. We are one of the large Halloween creators and suppliers in the world. With our dedicated and talented team, we look forward to new developments in the years ahead.

Sharp & Classy My son is 5'11, 205lbs . Chose an XL with plenty of room . Mostly worried about the length which was perfect. A large might have worked for him. We tighted with the slide buckle on the back. He used the vest for a Roaring 20s themed dance at school , but this classy look he will use again for any event he needs the wear a tie for. The vest is all one piece and is very nice and made well. I recommend it Great piece for a costume or night out I ordered this for an event costume . Ordered a small for a tall thin boy. Perfect fit. This will be used for performance . I\u2019m 178 cm and 79 kg . Size on picture is Large . Good value for money. Will purcase again. GREAT DESIGN FOR WARM WEATHER AND GREATER ARM MOVEMENT This is the best design I have ever worn, it is a one piece vest and sleeveless \u201cappearing \u201c suit coat. It was so much cooler for a 90 degree outdoor wedding than a full 3 piece suite. The best was being able to have full range of motion for full arm reaching with no pulling or tightness. It washes great and only needs a quick light drying. The lapels give the appearance of a formal tux or suit. The compliments were great, I was asked we\u2019re I got it from and couldn\u2019t believe the low cost for a must have highly recommended unique addition to any guys closet.

Sharp & Classy My son is 5'11, 205lbs . Chose an XL with plenty of room . Mostly worried about the length which was perfect. A large might have worked for him. We tighted with the slide buckle on the back. He used the vest for a Roaring 20s themed dance at school , but this classy look he will use again for any event he needs the wear a tie for. The vest is all one piece and is very nice and made well. I recommend it Great piece for a costume or night out I ordered this for an event costume . Ordered a small for a tall thin boy. Perfect fit. This will be used for performance . I\u2019m 178 cm and 79 kg . Size on picture is Large . Good value for money. Will purcase again. GREAT DESIGN FOR WARM WEATHER AND GREATER ARM MOVEMENT This is the best design I have ever worn, it is a one piece vest and sleeveless \u201cappearing \u201c suit coat. It was so much cooler for a 90 degree outdoor wedding than a full 3 piece suite. The best was being able to have full range of motion for full arm reaching with no pulling or tightness. It washes great and only needs a quick light drying. The lapels give the appearance of a formal tux or suit. The compliments were great, I was asked we\u2019re I got it from and couldn\u2019t believe the low cost for a must have highly recommended unique addition to any guys closet. This looks great on any age and fits perfectly to scale. I am looking for other colors it may come in. Very sharp and perfect for that special occasion It came good with my blue suits.
