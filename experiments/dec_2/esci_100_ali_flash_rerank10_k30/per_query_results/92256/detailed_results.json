And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service.

The G1026 3 HP Shaper comes with 1/2\", 3/4\" and 1\" spindles sizes to work efficiently in combination with different sized cutters and spacers. It also comes with three table inserts which give you four possible opening diameters in the table surface. Using the smallest opening that a particular cutter allows offers more support for the workpiece and reduces the amount of chips that fall into the machine. The 3 HP motor rotates the spindles at 7000 and 10,000 RPMs. Large cutters (3-1/2\" or greater) must be operated at 7000 RPM; smaller cutters can be operated at 10,000 RPM. The precision-ground cast-iron table of the G1026 measures 28-1/4\" x 30-1/2\". The two-piece cast-iron fence is independently adjustable for different cutting thicknesses and special shaping applications. It is also removable for easy replacement with a zero-clearance or other custom-made fence. None of our competitors can come close to this price point! Like all of the Grizzly shapers, the G1026 comes with a 1-year warranty covering parts and assuring the unit is free from factory defects. (Consumables are not covered by the warranty.) The G1026 manual was written by our U.S. based Technical Documentation Department and is packed with useful information. The complete and easy-to-read manual makes it easier to assemble and maintain your shaper. The Grizzly Customer Service and Technical Support Teams are U.S. based.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

The wooden massage tool is used in maderotherapy and is designed to suit specific parts of the body. Eastern cultures have already been using it for centuries for therapeutic purposes. Classic maderotherapy is a completely natural massage technique in which we stimulate lymphatic drainage with the help of a wooden board. Consequently, we eliminate cellulite, break fat cells, and improve blood and lymph flow throughout the body. By speeding up the lymphatic system, maderotherapy increases the secretion of all toxins and waste materials from the body. Lymph capillary flow increases. Using the vacuum of lymph capillaries to suck up large amounts of lymph, lymphatic capillaries absorb larger amounts of lymph, thus achieving effective detoxification of the body and an immediate result \u2013 a significant loss of centimeters. Maderotherapy is recommended for: Reducing or eliminating cellulite. Stimulation of the lymphatic system. Detoxification and stimulation of metabolism. Fat burning. Improving skin tone and tension. Reduction in volume. Relaxation of body and mind. How to use Mr. Woodware Massage tool properly First, apply the oil to the area you want to massage.

Beautiful Looking Joinery Doesn't Have To Be Difficult When building doors and drawers for kitchen and bathroom cabinets we want everything to be just right. This includes the style and rail joinery the can be seen from the top and bottom of the doors and drawers. While the style cut runs the entire length of the work piece, the rail is usually a very small run of a couple of inches. In the past, many of us used to attempt this cut freehanded. The end grain cut of such a small section is not only dangerous, it often times produced less than desirable results. With the Fulton Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO, you will be able to not only make the cut with confidence, you will also produce wonderful looking rail end grain profiles with minimal tear-out. This makes for the ideal fit into the style piece Clear Acrylic Guide Fence The Clear Acrylic Guide Fence essentially pull double duty. First and foremost it provides you with a reference contact point to your router table fence. This means that when you are placing your stock on to the jig you simply align with the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence. An easy way to do this is to place the Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO against your router table fence with the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence flat against the router table fence. Then slide your stock piece on to the Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO with the end up against your router table fence and secure your work piece. This essentially aligns your stock with the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence. Please follow the instructions that come with the sled before making any cuts on your router table with the Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO. The second duty that the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence does is it acts as a shield to keep debris from flying up at you while making your cuts. Since the guide is clear, you can see exactly what you are doing while still being protected. Keep Your Stock Secure With a solid base platform, a large toggle with an oversized hold down pad and an adjustable fence with a holdfast abrasive strip, you stock won't lift, dip or slide out of place when making your coping cuts. The large toggle with hold down pads provides more than enough pressure to keep your stock from popping up our out of the sled. The adjustable fence is pushed up against the front side of your stock to keep your stock from moving front to back. With the addition of a simple abrasive strip to the adjustable fence, your stock piece won't shimmy side to side either. This jig has got all the bases covered when it comes to securing your stock in place for safer, cleaner and smoother coping cuts. Its Time!

Visit the Store Precision Miter Gauge & Fence Visit the Store Next page Product Description Control stock while keeping your fingers away from danger... Push blocks are an essential part of workshop safety. Whenever we need to push stock through on router tables, band saws, jointers, shapers and in some cases table saws, it is always a good idea to keep our fingers away from the blade or cutter. This push block has been designed with exactly that in mind. The block is made from a heavy polyethylene plastic that absorbs any sort of shock. It won't crack or shatter if dropped and it won't crack or shatter if it comes into contact with a blade or cutter. This makes the push block the perfect safety accessory for any work shop environment. Push Blocks can be used on multiple machines, in multiple ways Router Table One of the more common uses, the push block works exceptionally well when feeding stock through on a router table. Simple downward and inward pressure keeps the stock up against the fence while at the same time keeping your fingers away from harm. Free Hand Routing with Two Push Blocks Free hand routing can be a little tricky. Typically free hand routing is done on curved or round stock and keeping your fingers away from the cutter can prove to be a challenge. Using two push blocks not only keeps your fingers away from danger, but allows you to control your stock when feeding it though the cutter. Band Saw Re-Saw Applications Re-sawing is a common use for band saws. Using a push block to feed your stock through the blade makes this process safer by keeping your fingers away from the blade at all times. Double Up for More Power on the Jointer When jointing or planing wider stock on a jointer, it can be tough to feed the stock through the cutters. The jointer generates a lot of power. Using two push blocks at a time on your stock helps you place the much needed downward force to feed your stock through the cutters. Read more Heavy Duty Material for Everyday Workshop Use! Stands up to the everyday workshop environment! The push block is made from a heavy duty, injected molded, polyethylene plastic material. This material is very thick or dense and provides the user with a substantial feel in there hand when using it. This along with the angled, molded handle grip gives you more leverage than straight vertical style push blocks. Soft, Receptive Foam Rubber Pad for Gripping Your Stock Soft, receptive, rubber foam pads line the base of the push block. The rubber pads make pushing, gripping and controlling your stock much easier and safer than doing it free handed. The pad is is approximately 3/16\" thick and works on many different types of materials Read more Keep it clean The rubber pads are easily washable with warm water. The pad must be completely dry before using again Do not use paper towels to wipe off the pad. We recommend using a microfiber or cotton cloth.

The G1026 3 HP Shaper comes with 1/2\", 3/4\" and 1\" spindles sizes to work efficiently in combination with different sized cutters and spacers. It also comes with three table inserts which give you four possible opening diameters in the table surface.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class.

The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

The wooden massage tool is used in maderotherapy and is designed to suit specific parts of the body. Eastern cultures have already been using it for centuries for therapeutic purposes. Classic maderotherapy is a completely natural massage technique in which we stimulate lymphatic drainage with the help of a wooden board. Consequently, we eliminate cellulite, break fat cells, and improve blood and lymph flow throughout the body. By speeding up the lymphatic system, maderotherapy increases the secretion of all toxins and waste materials from the body. Lymph capillary flow increases. Using the vacuum of lymph capillaries to suck up large amounts of lymph, lymphatic capillaries absorb larger amounts of lymph, thus achieving effective detoxification of the body and an immediate result \u2013 a significant loss of centimeters. Maderotherapy is recommended for: Reducing or eliminating cellulite. Stimulation of the lymphatic system. Detoxification and stimulation of metabolism. Fat burning. Improving skin tone and tension. Reduction in volume. Relaxation of body and mind. How to use Mr. Woodware Massage tool properly First, apply the oil to the area you want to massage. Then start performing a special massage \u2013 maderotherapy. To reduce friction, any kind of oil can be used, however, it has to be of sufficient quality to avoid allergic reactions.

No longer worry about your piece dipping to far into the router bit and even worse losing control. This sled will help you produce wonderful looking and fitting end grain cuts each and every time you use it! Beautiful Looking Joinery Doesn't Have To Be Difficult When building doors and drawers for kitchen and bathroom cabinets we want everything to be just right. This includes the style and rail joinery the can be seen from the top and bottom of the doors and drawers. While the style cut runs the entire length of the work piece, the rail is usually a very small run of a couple of inches. In the past, many of us used to attempt this cut freehanded. The end grain cut of such a small section is not only dangerous, it often times produced less than desirable results. With the Fulton Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO, you will be able to not only make the cut with confidence, you will also produce wonderful looking rail end grain profiles with minimal tear-out. This makes for the ideal fit into the style piece Clear Acrylic Guide Fence The Clear Acrylic Guide Fence essentially pull double duty.

This means that when you are placing your stock on to the jig you simply align with the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence. An easy way to do this is to place the Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO against your router table fence with the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence flat against the router table fence. Then slide your stock piece on to the Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO with the end up against your router table fence and secure your work piece. This essentially aligns your stock with the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence. Please follow the instructions that come with the sled before making any cuts on your router table with the Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO. The second duty that the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence does is it acts as a shield to keep debris from flying up at you while making your cuts. Since the guide is clear, you can see exactly what you are doing while still being protected. Keep Your Stock Secure With a solid base platform, a large toggle with an oversized hold down pad and an adjustable fence with a holdfast abrasive strip, you stock won't lift, dip or slide out of place when making your coping cuts. The large toggle with hold down pads provides more than enough pressure to keep your stock from popping up our out of the sled. The adjustable fence is pushed up against the front side of your stock to keep your stock from moving front to back. With the addition of a simple abrasive strip to the adjustable fence, your stock piece won't shimmy side to side either. This jig has got all the bases covered when it comes to securing your stock in place for safer, cleaner and smoother coping cuts. Its Time! Now that you know that there is a much better and safer way to make end grain coping cuts on you cabinet door and drawer rails, there's nothing holding you back!

Visit the Store Precision Miter Gauge & Fence Visit the Store Next page Product Description Control stock while keeping your fingers away from danger... Push blocks are an essential part of workshop safety. Whenever we need to push stock through on router tables, band saws, jointers, shapers and in some cases table saws, it is always a good idea to keep our fingers away from the blade or cutter. This push block has been designed with exactly that in mind. The block is made from a heavy polyethylene plastic that absorbs any sort of shock. It won't crack or shatter if dropped and it won't crack or shatter if it comes into contact with a blade or cutter. This makes the push block the perfect safety accessory for any work shop environment. Push Blocks can be used on multiple machines, in multiple ways Router Table One of the more common uses, the push block works exceptionally well when feeding stock through on a router table. Simple downward and inward pressure keeps the stock up against the fence while at the same time keeping your fingers away from harm. Free Hand Routing with Two Push Blocks Free hand routing can be a little tricky. Typically free hand routing is done on curved or round stock and keeping your fingers away from the cutter can prove to be a challenge. Using two push blocks not only keeps your fingers away from danger, but allows you to control your stock when feeding it though the cutter. Band Saw Re-Saw Applications Re-sawing is a common use for band saws. Using a push block to feed your stock through the blade makes this process safer by keeping your fingers away from the blade at all times. Double Up for More Power on the Jointer When jointing or planing wider stock on a jointer, it can be tough to feed the stock through the cutters. The jointer generates a lot of power. Using two push blocks at a time on your stock helps you place the much needed downward force to feed your stock through the cutters. Read more Heavy Duty Material for Everyday Workshop Use! Stands up to the everyday workshop environment! The push block is made from a heavy duty, injected molded, polyethylene plastic material. This material is very thick or dense and provides the user with a substantial feel in there hand when using it. This along with the angled, molded handle grip gives you more leverage than straight vertical style push blocks. Soft, Receptive Foam Rubber Pad for Gripping Your Stock Soft, receptive, rubber foam pads line the base of the push block. The rubber pads make pushing, gripping and controlling your stock much easier and safer than doing it free handed. The pad is is approximately 3/16\" thick and works on many different types of materials Read more Keep it clean The rubber pads are easily washable with warm water. The pad must be completely dry before using again Do not use paper towels to wipe off the pad. We recommend using a microfiber or cotton cloth.

As the market for automotive refurbishing began to take off in the 1970s, Curt realized that proper tools and techniques could save enthusiasts like him time and money. So in the fall of 1978, Curt launched a business to better serve the burgeoning market of auto restoration and customization hobbyists, and he called it Eastwood. Since its inception, Eastwood recognizes that change constantly takes place in the marketplace, and so strives to stay abreast of these developments by placing customers' wants and needs at the forefront.

The G1026 3 HP Shaper comes with 1/2\", 3/4\" and 1\" spindles sizes to work efficiently in combination with different sized cutters and spacers. It also comes with three table inserts which give you four possible opening diameters in the table surface. Using the smallest opening that a particular cutter allows offers more support for the workpiece and reduces the amount of chips that fall into the machine. The 3 HP motor rotates the spindles at 7000 and 10,000 RPMs. Large cutters (3-1/2\" or greater) must be operated at 7000 RPM; smaller cutters can be operated at 10,000 RPM. The precision-ground cast-iron table of the G1026 measures 28-1/4\" x 30-1/2\". The two-piece cast-iron fence is independently adjustable for different cutting thicknesses and special shaping applications. It is also removable for easy replacement with a zero-clearance or other custom-made fence. None of our competitors can come close to this price point! Like all of the Grizzly shapers, the G1026 comes with a 1-year warranty covering parts and assuring the unit is free from factory defects. (Consumables are not covered by the warranty.) The G1026 manual was written by our U.S. based Technical Documentation Department and is packed with useful information. The complete and easy-to-read manual makes it easier to assemble and maintain your shaper. The Grizzly Customer Service and Technical Support Teams are U.S. based.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

The wooden massage tool is used in maderotherapy and is designed to suit specific parts of the body. Eastern cultures have already been using it for centuries for therapeutic purposes. Classic maderotherapy is a completely natural massage technique in which we stimulate lymphatic drainage with the help of a wooden board. Consequently, we eliminate cellulite, break fat cells, and improve blood and lymph flow throughout the body. By speeding up the lymphatic system, maderotherapy increases the secretion of all toxins and waste materials from the body. Lymph capillary flow increases. Using the vacuum of lymph capillaries to suck up large amounts of lymph, lymphatic capillaries absorb larger amounts of lymph, thus achieving effective detoxification of the body and an immediate result \u2013 a significant loss of centimeters. Maderotherapy is recommended for: Reducing or eliminating cellulite. Stimulation of the lymphatic system. Detoxification and stimulation of metabolism. Fat burning. Improving skin tone and tension.

No longer worry about your piece dipping to far into the router bit and even worse losing control. This sled will help you produce wonderful looking and fitting end grain cuts each and every time you use it! Beautiful Looking Joinery Doesn't Have To Be Difficult When building doors and drawers for kitchen and bathroom cabinets we want everything to be just right. This includes the style and rail joinery the can be seen from the top and bottom of the doors and drawers. While the style cut runs the entire length of the work piece, the rail is usually a very small run of a couple of inches. In the past, many of us used to attempt this cut freehanded. The end grain cut of such a small section is not only dangerous, it often times produced less than desirable results. With the Fulton Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO, you will be able to not only make the cut with confidence, you will also produce wonderful looking rail end grain profiles with minimal tear-out. This makes for the ideal fit into the style piece Clear Acrylic Guide Fence The Clear Acrylic Guide Fence essentially pull double duty.

This means that when you are placing your stock on to the jig you simply align with the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence. An easy way to do this is to place the Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO against your router table fence with the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence flat against the router table fence. Then slide your stock piece on to the Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO with the end up against your router table fence and secure your work piece. This essentially aligns your stock with the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence. Please follow the instructions that come with the sled before making any cuts on your router table with the Rail Guide Coping Sled PRO. The second duty that the Clear Acrylic Guide Fence does is it acts as a shield to keep debris from flying up at you while making your cuts. Since the guide is clear, you can see exactly what you are doing while still being protected. Keep Your Stock Secure With a solid base platform, a large toggle with an oversized hold down pad and an adjustable fence with a holdfast abrasive strip, you stock won't lift, dip or slide out of place when making your coping cuts. The large toggle with hold down pads provides more than enough pressure to keep your stock from popping up our out of the sled. The adjustable fence is pushed up against the front side of your stock to keep your stock from moving front to back. With the addition of a simple abrasive strip to the adjustable fence, your stock piece won't shimmy side to side either. This jig has got all the bases covered when it comes to securing your stock in place for safer, cleaner and smoother coping cuts. Its Time! Now that you know that there is a much better and safer way to make end grain coping cuts on you cabinet door and drawer rails, there's nothing holding you back!

Visit the Store Precision Miter Gauge & Fence Visit the Store Next page Product Description Control stock while keeping your fingers away from danger... Push blocks are an essential part of workshop safety. Whenever we need to push stock through on router tables, band saws, jointers, shapers and in some cases table saws, it is always a good idea to keep our fingers away from the blade or cutter. This push block has been designed with exactly that in mind. The block is made from a heavy polyethylene plastic that absorbs any sort of shock. It won't crack or shatter if dropped and it won't crack or shatter if it comes into contact with a blade or cutter. This makes the push block the perfect safety accessory for any work shop environment. Push Blocks can be used on multiple machines, in multiple ways Router Table One of the more common uses, the push block works exceptionally well when feeding stock through on a router table. Simple downward and inward pressure keeps the stock up against the fence while at the same time keeping your fingers away from harm. Free Hand Routing with Two Push Blocks Free hand routing can be a little tricky. Typically free hand routing is done on curved or round stock and keeping your fingers away from the cutter can prove to be a challenge. Using two push blocks not only keeps your fingers away from danger, but allows you to control your stock when feeding it though the cutter. Band Saw Re-Saw Applications Re-sawing is a common use for band saws. Using a push block to feed your stock through the blade makes this process safer by keeping your fingers away from the blade at all times. Double Up for More Power on the Jointer When jointing or planing wider stock on a jointer, it can be tough to feed the stock through the cutters. The jointer generates a lot of power. Using two push blocks at a time on your stock helps you place the much needed downward force to feed your stock through the cutters. Read more Heavy Duty Material for Everyday Workshop Use! Stands up to the everyday workshop environment! The push block is made from a heavy duty, injected molded, polyethylene plastic material. This material is very thick or dense and provides the user with a substantial feel in there hand when using it. This along with the angled, molded handle grip gives you more leverage than straight vertical style push blocks. Soft, Receptive Foam Rubber Pad for Gripping Your Stock Soft, receptive, rubber foam pads line the base of the push block. The rubber pads make pushing, gripping and controlling your stock much easier and safer than doing it free handed. The pad is is approximately 3/16\" thick and works on many different types of materials Read more Keep it clean The rubber pads are easily washable with warm water. The pad must be completely dry before using again Do not use paper towels to wipe off the pad. We recommend using a microfiber or cotton cloth.
