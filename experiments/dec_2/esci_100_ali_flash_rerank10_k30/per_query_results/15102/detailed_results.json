It is the VLCD that causes the weight loss.. There is NO magic pill that one could take and then just sit back and watch tv while the weight melts off. The Transformation drops are an appetite suppressant. They help maintain your energy levels while on the VLCD (calories are fuel - energy for your body). Most important benefit of the Transformation drops by BSkinny Global are that when you lose weight rapidly, your body thinks it's starving and will rid itself of fat AND MUSCLE - (think metabolism). We want to protect this muscle (one pound of muscle is much more dense than one pound of fat AND burns many more calories/day than one pound of fat) Because of its density (MORE DENSE) muscle takes up less room in the body than its counterpart (fat). So a person could hypothetically stay the same weight on the scale while looking smaller and dropping pant/dress sizes. (all while increasing their metabolism - gaining fat burning muscle) The TRANSFORMATION drops help minimize the loss of muscle during this VLCD. Your body need to burn approximately 2500 additional calories per day than you consume (eat or drink) to lose one pound. The drops help maintain your metabolism (the rate you burn calories) to help prevent the yo yo effect of dieting. They Work! But you must Work too. We wish you wellness.

A 'Pregnant' result may appear in 1 minute when testing from the day of your missed period. You should wait 3 minutes to confirm a 'Not Pregnant' result.

Read more Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test: Features A 'Pregnant' result may appear in as little as 1 minute when testing from the day of the missed period.[3] Results are over 99% accurate from the day of your expected period [2], giving you a clear, accurate result when you need it most. With Clearblue Rapid Detection, you can even test from 5 days before your missed period (which is 4 days before your expected period).[4] Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test features unique Floodguard Technology inside to help keep excess urine from entering the device. It helps reduce the No. 1 reported cause of user error by over 70%.[5] Our easy-to-use design is so innovative it was awarded a prestigious RedDot Design award in 2012 and in a US study was found to be the easiest to use line test.[6] Read more Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test FAQs Q1. How accurate is Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test? Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test is more than 99% accurate in laboratory tests, when used from the day you expect your period to start. If you are testing earlier than the day of your expected period, the accuracy of Clearblue Digital will be lower. In lab testing, 99% of 'Pregnant' results were detected 1 day before the expected period, 98% at 2 days before, 95% at 3 days before, and 75% at 4 days before. Q2. When can I test with Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test with Smart Countdown? The pregnancy hormone hCG increases rapidly in early pregnancy and Clearblue Digital can be used to test 5 days before your missed period (which is 4 days before you expect your period). If testing before your expected period, you must use the first urine of the day; otherwise you can test at any time of the day. Q3. Can any medication or medical conditions affect the result? Always read manufacturer\u2019s instructions for any medication you are taking before testing. Fertility medications containing hCG (such as Pregnyl and Profasi) can give misleading results (these fertility medications are usually given by injection) and testing too soon after administration may give a false 'Pregnant' result. Other fertility therapies (such as Clomid), painkillers and hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pills) are unlikely to affect the result. If you have recently stopped using hormonal contraception or are using fertility therapies like Clomid, your periods may be irregular, leading you to test too soon. If you have recently been pregnant (even if not carried to full term), you may get a false 'Pregnant' result. If you are in or approaching menopause, you may obtain a false positive result even though you are not pregnant. In a study of women tested with different lots of Clearblue, an average of 0.3% of results were positive, with a range from 0% to 1% for different lots. All false positive results were from women aged over 50 years. Ectopic pregnancy and ovarian cysts can give misleading results. If you have a \u2018Pregnant\u2019 result, it is possible that you may later find that you are not pregnant due to a natural loss of the pregnancy, which can occur in the early stages. If you get unexpected results, you should discuss them with your doctor. Q4. The Smart Countdown went much faster than I expected, what does this mean? Some results can be displayed in as little as 1 minute. In such cases the Smart Countdown segments will appear more rapidly. A 'Pregnant' result is displayed on the screen for up to 6 months, for your use when you\u2019re ready to share the news. A 'Not Pregnant' result lasts for approximately 24 hours. Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test FAQs Q1. How accurate is it? Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test is over 99% accurate from the day you expect your period [2], giving you a clear and accurate result when you need it most. Q2. When can I test? You can use Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test from 5 days before your missed period (which is 4 days before your expected period) [4]. If testing before your expected period, you must use the first urine of the day; otherwise you can test at any time of the day. Q3. Can any medication or medical conditions affect the result? Always read the manufacturer's instructions for any medication you are taking before conducting a test. Fertility medications containing hCG can give misleading results (these fertility medications are usually given by injection, and testing too soon after administration may give a false 'Pregnant' result). Other fertility therapies (such as clomiphene citrate), painkillers and hormonal contraceptives (e.g., contraceptive pill) should not affect the result. If you have recently stopped using hormonal contraception or are using fertility therapies like clomiphene citrate, your periods may be irregular, leading you to test too soon. If you have recently been pregnant (even if not carried to full term), you may get a false 'Pregnant' result. _____________________ [1] Data on file. Clearblue recommends that women test from the day of the expected period. However, the pregnancy hormone increases rapidly in early pregnancy and Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test can be used to test up to 4 days before the expected period, which is 5 days sooner than waiting for the missed period. In clinical testing, Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test detected the pregnancy hormone in 51% of women when testing 4 days before their expected period, 82% at 3 days before their expected period, 90% at 2 days before their expected period, and 95% at 1 day before their expected period. [2] 99% accurate at detecting typical pregnancy hormone levels. Note that hormone levels vary. See insert. [3] Wait 3 minutes to confirm a 'Not Pregnant' result or if testing early.

Drop leg holsters are primarily a military item that were designed for the battlefield. The point is to disperse your necessary equipment over a larger part of your body, making it easier to carry. Additionally, a drop leg holster makes it much easier to draw your firearm.It also comes into its own when you're wearing a rappelling harness.

Here is a brief look at what each of the phases will be like: 1st Phase: The initiation phase of the Diet Drops Plan is concentrated around teaching you how to make proper use of the Diet Drops. The phase really lasts only two days, and you are actually encouraged to eat to your heart's content while drinking up to one gallon of water per day (no less than half a gallon though). 2nd Phase: Once the first phase has been completed things will be set in full motion. As the phase continues the amount of calories you eat will gradually decrease, allowing you to shed extra fat and continue on your way to a healthy body. 3rd Phase: This is the phase where the plan sets itself apart from the myriad of fad diets saturating the market these days. After 45 days (or when you reach your target weight), you will start to follow the maintenance cycle. In other words, once you have dropped the weight, you will be given the means to keep it that way and prevent yourself from going back to square one. While you are in maintenance mode there is no longer a calorie limit for you to abide by; you will have to drink lots of water and carefully watch what you eat.

Read more Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test: Features A 'Pregnant' result may appear in as little as 1 minute when testing from the day of the missed period.[3] Results are over 99% accurate from the day of your expected period [2], giving you a clear, accurate result when you need it most. With Clearblue Rapid Detection, you can even test from 5 days before your missed period (which is 4 days before your expected period).[4] Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test features unique Floodguard Technology inside to help keep excess urine from entering the device. It helps reduce the No. 1 reported cause of user error by over 70%.[5] Our easy-to-use design is so innovative it was awarded a prestigious RedDot Design award in 2012 and in a US study was found to be the easiest to use line test.[6] Read more Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test FAQs Q1. How accurate is Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test? Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test is more than 99% accurate in laboratory tests, when used from the day you expect your period to start. If you are testing earlier than the day of your expected period, the accuracy of Clearblue Digital will be lower. In lab testing, 99% of 'Pregnant' results were detected 1 day before the expected period, 98% at 2 days before, 95% at 3 days before, and 75% at 4 days before. Q2. When can I test with Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test with Smart Countdown? The pregnancy hormone hCG increases rapidly in early pregnancy and Clearblue Digital can be used to test 5 days before your missed period (which is 4 days before you expect your period). If testing before your expected period, you must use the first urine of the day; otherwise you can test at any time of the day. Q3. Can any medication or medical conditions affect the result? Always read manufacturer\u2019s instructions for any medication you are taking before testing. Fertility medications containing hCG (such as Pregnyl and Profasi) can give misleading results (these fertility medications are usually given by injection) and testing too soon after administration may give a false 'Pregnant' result. Other fertility therapies (such as Clomid), painkillers and hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pills) are unlikely to affect the result. If you have recently stopped using hormonal contraception or are using fertility therapies like Clomid, your periods may be irregular, leading you to test too soon. If you have recently been pregnant (even if not carried to full term), you may get a false 'Pregnant' result. If you are in or approaching menopause, you may obtain a false positive result even though you are not pregnant. In a study of women tested with different lots of Clearblue, an average of 0.3% of results were positive, with a range from 0% to 1% for different lots. All false positive results were from women aged over 50 years. Ectopic pregnancy and ovarian cysts can give misleading results. If you have a \u2018Pregnant\u2019 result, it is possible that you may later find that you are not pregnant due to a natural loss of the pregnancy, which can occur in the early stages. If you get unexpected results, you should discuss them with your doctor. Q4. The Smart Countdown went much faster than I expected, what does this mean? Some results can be displayed in as little as 1 minute. In such cases the Smart Countdown segments will appear more rapidly. A 'Pregnant' result is displayed on the screen for up to 6 months, for your use when you\u2019re ready to share the news. A 'Not Pregnant' result lasts for approximately 24 hours. Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test FAQs Q1. How accurate is it? Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test is over 99% accurate from the day you expect your period [2], giving you a clear and accurate result when you need it most. Q2. When can I test? You can use Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test from 5 days before your missed period (which is 4 days before your expected period) [4]. If testing before your expected period, you must use the first urine of the day; otherwise you can test at any time of the day. Q3. Can any medication or medical conditions affect the result? Always read the manufacturer's instructions for any medication you are taking before conducting a test. Fertility medications containing hCG can give misleading results (these fertility medications are usually given by injection, and testing too soon after administration may give a false 'Pregnant' result). Other fertility therapies (such as clomiphene citrate), painkillers and hormonal contraceptives (e.g., contraceptive pill) should not affect the result. If you have recently stopped using hormonal contraception or are using fertility therapies like clomiphene citrate, your periods may be irregular, leading you to test too soon. If you have recently been pregnant (even if not carried to full term), you may get a false 'Pregnant' result. _____________________ [1] Data on file. Clearblue recommends that women test from the day of the expected period. However, the pregnancy hormone increases rapidly in early pregnancy and Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test can be used to test up to 4 days before the expected period, which is 5 days sooner than waiting for the missed period. In clinical testing, Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test detected the pregnancy hormone in 51% of women when testing 4 days before their expected period, 82% at 3 days before their expected period, 90% at 2 days before their expected period, and 95% at 1 day before their expected period. [2] 99% accurate at detecting typical pregnancy hormone levels. Note that hormone levels vary. See insert. [3] Wait 3 minutes to confirm a 'Not Pregnant' result or if testing early. [4] Can be used 5 days before your missed period (4 days before your expected period). In lab testing, 98% of 'Pregnant' results were detected the day before the expected period, 97% were detected 2 days before, 88% were detected 3 days before and 56% were detected 4 days before.

Additionally, a drop leg holster makes it much easier to draw your firearm.It also comes into its own when you're wearing a rappelling harness. There is no point in extending your draw stroke and adding unnecessary weight to your legs (when your hips are better at carrying it) unless you're going to gain something from it. This style of holster definitely has distinct advantages, but they will only be realized when used in the right circumstances.

Here is a brief look at what each of the phases will be like: 1st Phase: The initiation phase of the Diet Drops Plan is concentrated around teaching you how to make proper use of the Diet Drops. The phase really lasts only two days, and you are actually encouraged to eat to your heart's content while drinking up to one gallon of water per day (no less than half a gallon though). 2nd Phase: Once the first phase has been completed things will be set in full motion. As the phase continues the amount of calories you eat will gradually decrease, allowing you to shed extra fat and continue on your way to a healthy body. 3rd Phase: This is the phase where the plan sets itself apart from the myriad of fad diets saturating the market these days. After 45 days (or when you reach your target weight), you will start to follow the maintenance cycle. In other words, once you have dropped the weight, you will be given the means to keep it that way and prevent yourself from going back to square one. While you are in maintenance mode there is no longer a calorie limit for you to abide by; you will have to drink lots of water and carefully watch what you eat.

It is the VLCD that causes the weight loss.. There is NO magic pill that one could take and then just sit back and watch tv while the weight melts off. The Transformation drops are an appetite suppressant. They help maintain your energy levels while on the VLCD (calories are fuel - energy for your body). Most important benefit of the Transformation drops by BSkinny Global are that when you lose weight rapidly, your body thinks it's starving and will rid itself of fat AND MUSCLE - (think metabolism). We want to protect this muscle (one pound of muscle is much more dense than one pound of fat AND burns many more calories/day than one pound of fat) Because of its density (MORE DENSE) muscle takes up less room in the body than its counterpart (fat). So a person could hypothetically stay the same weight on the scale while looking smaller and dropping pant/dress sizes. (all while increasing their metabolism - gaining fat burning muscle) The TRANSFORMATION drops help minimize the loss of muscle during this VLCD. Your body need to burn approximately 2500 additional calories per day than you consume (eat or drink) to lose one pound. The drops help maintain your metabolism (the rate you burn calories) to help prevent the yo yo effect of dieting. They Work! But you must Work too. We wish you wellness.

A 'Pregnant' result may appear in 1 minute when testing from the day of your missed period. You should wait 3 minutes to confirm a 'Not Pregnant' result. Read more Digital Pregnancy Test with Smart Countdown: Features Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test with Smart Countdown features our unique progress indicator that reassures you from start to finish the test is working correctly as it counts down to your result.

Read more Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test: Features A 'Pregnant' result may appear in as little as 1 minute when testing from the day of the missed period.[3] Results are over 99% accurate from the day of your expected period [2], giving you a clear, accurate result when you need it most. With Clearblue Rapid Detection, you can even test from 5 days before your missed period (which is 4 days before your expected period).[4] Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test features unique Floodguard Technology inside to help keep excess urine from entering the device. It helps reduce the No. 1 reported cause of user error by over 70%.[5] Our easy-to-use design is so innovative it was awarded a prestigious RedDot Design award in 2012 and in a US study was found to be the easiest to use line test.[6] Read more Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test FAQs Q1. How accurate is Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test? Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test is more than 99% accurate in laboratory tests, when used from the day you expect your period to start. If you are testing earlier than the day of your expected period, the accuracy of Clearblue Digital will be lower. In lab testing, 99% of 'Pregnant' results were detected 1 day before the expected period, 98% at 2 days before, 95% at 3 days before, and 75% at 4 days before. Q2. When can I test with Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test with Smart Countdown? The pregnancy hormone hCG increases rapidly in early pregnancy and Clearblue Digital can be used to test 5 days before your missed period (which is 4 days before you expect your period). If testing before your expected period, you must use the first urine of the day; otherwise you can test at any time of the day. Q3. Can any medication or medical conditions affect the result? Always read manufacturer\u2019s instructions for any medication you are taking before testing. Fertility medications containing hCG (such as Pregnyl and Profasi) can give misleading results (these fertility medications are usually given by injection) and testing too soon after administration may give a false 'Pregnant' result. Other fertility therapies (such as Clomid), painkillers and hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pills) are unlikely to affect the result. If you have recently stopped using hormonal contraception or are using fertility therapies like Clomid, your periods may be irregular, leading you to test too soon. If you have recently been pregnant (even if not carried to full term), you may get a false 'Pregnant' result. If you are in or approaching menopause, you may obtain a false positive result even though you are not pregnant. In a study of women tested with different lots of Clearblue, an average of 0.3% of results were positive, with a range from 0% to 1% for different lots. All false positive results were from women aged over 50 years. Ectopic pregnancy and ovarian cysts can give misleading results. If you have a \u2018Pregnant\u2019 result, it is possible that you may later find that you are not pregnant due to a natural loss of the pregnancy, which can occur in the early stages. If you get unexpected results, you should discuss them with your doctor. Q4. The Smart Countdown went much faster than I expected, what does this mean? Some results can be displayed in as little as 1 minute. In such cases the Smart Countdown segments will appear more rapidly. A 'Pregnant' result is displayed on the screen for up to 6 months, for your use when you\u2019re ready to share the news. A 'Not Pregnant' result lasts for approximately 24 hours. Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test FAQs Q1. How accurate is it? Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test is over 99% accurate from the day you expect your period [2], giving you a clear and accurate result when you need it most. Q2. When can I test? You can use Clearblue Rapid Detection Pregnancy Test from 5 days before your missed period (which is 4 days before your expected period) [4]. If testing before your expected period, you must use the first urine of the day; otherwise you can test at any time of the day. Q3. Can any medication or medical conditions affect the result? Always read the manufacturer's instructions for any medication you are taking before conducting a test. Fertility medications containing hCG can give misleading results (these fertility medications are usually given by injection, and testing too soon after administration may give a false 'Pregnant' result). Other fertility therapies (such as clomiphene citrate), painkillers and hormonal contraceptives (e.g., contraceptive pill) should not affect the result. If you have recently stopped using hormonal contraception or are using fertility therapies like clomiphene citrate, your periods may be irregular, leading you to test too soon. If you have recently been pregnant (even if not carried to full term), you may get a false 'Pregnant' result. _____________________ [1] Data on file. Clearblue recommends that women test from the day of the expected period. However, the pregnancy hormone increases rapidly in early pregnancy and Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test can be used to test up to 4 days before the expected period, which is 5 days sooner than waiting for the missed period. In clinical testing, Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test detected the pregnancy hormone in 51% of women when testing 4 days before their expected period, 82% at 3 days before their expected period, 90% at 2 days before their expected period, and 95% at 1 day before their expected period. [2] 99% accurate at detecting typical pregnancy hormone levels. Note that hormone levels vary. See insert. [3] Wait 3 minutes to confirm a 'Not Pregnant' result or if testing early.

Drop leg holsters are primarily a military item that were designed for the battlefield. The point is to disperse your necessary equipment over a larger part of your body, making it easier to carry. Additionally, a drop leg holster makes it much easier to draw your firearm.It also comes into its own when you're wearing a rappelling harness. There is no point in extending your draw stroke and adding unnecessary weight to your legs (when your hips are better at carrying it) unless you're going to gain something from it. This style of holster definitely has distinct advantages, but they will only be realized when used in the right circumstances.

Here is a brief look at what each of the phases will be like: 1st Phase: The initiation phase of the Diet Drops Plan is concentrated around teaching you how to make proper use of the Diet Drops. The phase really lasts only two days, and you are actually encouraged to eat to your heart's content while drinking up to one gallon of water per day (no less than half a gallon though). 2nd Phase: Once the first phase has been completed things will be set in full motion. As the phase continues the amount of calories you eat will gradually decrease, allowing you to shed extra fat and continue on your way to a healthy body. 3rd Phase: This is the phase where the plan sets itself apart from the myriad of fad diets saturating the market these days. After 45 days (or when you reach your target weight), you will start to follow the maintenance cycle. In other words, once you have dropped the weight, you will be given the means to keep it that way and prevent yourself from going back to square one. While you are in maintenance mode there is no longer a calorie limit for you to abide by; you will have to drink lots of water and carefully watch what you eat.
