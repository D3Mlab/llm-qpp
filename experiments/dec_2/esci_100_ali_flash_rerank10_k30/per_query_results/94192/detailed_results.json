AUTHENTIC CASE This mouth harp comes with a protective case to store it and carry it with you while you are traveling or on the go. The case has a cord attached to it so you can hang it on your wrist. The case is crafted from cedar and the cord from premium leather. HIGH QUALITY All our mouth harps are made of high-quality materials, like steel and brass, to ensure that they will stand the test of time. ORIGINAL SOUND Limitless new sounds: our mouth harp is specifically designed to produce clear and crisp sounds! Depending on your breathing technique and movement, it can produce a unique variety of melodies. Read more MASTERING THE SOUND By hitting the tongue with your fingers, you create vibrations that are transmitted to the oral cavity, which serves as a resonator: by changing its contour, you can achieve a different timbral color of the sound of the instrument. The frame to which the tongue is attached is designed to fix the instrument in front of the teeth playing with the fingers of the other hand. The harp should be pressed tightly against the front teeth, but there should be a gap between the teeth that allows the tongue of the instrument to pass freely.

It is often associated with northern shamans and immersion in a alternative state of consciousness. Many people notice that playing the harp helps them relax, escape from the daily routine and enter a state of light trance. The harp, like no other instrument, is great for improvising a expirementing with various sounds. The mouth harp by MUARO is a great way to introduce yourself to the world of music and improvisation! AUTHENTIC CASE This mouth harp comes with a protective case to store it and carry it with you while you are traveling or on the go. The case has a cord attached to it so you can hang it on your wrist. The case is crafted from cedar and the cord from premium leather. HIGH QUALITY All our mouth harps are made of high-quality materials, like steel and brass, to ensure that they will stand the test of time. ORIGINAL SOUND Limitless new sounds: our mouth harp is specifically designed to produce clear and crisp sounds! Depending on your breathing technique and movement, it can produce a unique variety of melodies. Read more MASTERING THE SOUND By hitting the tongue with your fingers, you create vibrations that are transmitted to the oral cavity, which serves as a resonator: by changing its contour, you can achieve a different timbral color of the sound of the instrument. The frame to which the tongue is attached is designed to fix the instrument in front of the teeth playing with the fingers of the other hand. The harp should be pressed tightly against the front teeth, but there should be a gap between the teeth that allows the tongue of the instrument to pass freely.
