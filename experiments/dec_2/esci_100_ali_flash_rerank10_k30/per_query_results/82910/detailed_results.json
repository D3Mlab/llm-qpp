Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, Washington to Japan, JET began as a small dealer that sold air hoists and trolleys out of a single hardware store in Seattle. Over the years, JET has carried everything from snowmobiles, transmitter radios, and forklifts to nylon stockings, but by the early 1970s, metalworking had become the base of their business line. And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service. What's in the Box JMD-18 Mill Drill Machine, one worklamp, adjustable carbide facemill, drill press angle vise, 1/2-inch drill chuck, chuck arbor, and draw bar. Product Description Product Description Mill drills are a lighter alternative to a milling machine. These combine a belt driven drill press with the dual coordinate abilities of the milling machine's table for flexibility and efficiency. A locking collet prevents the cutting tool from falling away from the spindle when lateral forces are experienced against the bit. Although light in construction, the JMD Milling Drilling Machines possess the advantages of space-saving versatility, affordability and light machining capability. Amazon.com With its generously sized worktable and hinged belt cover for faster speed changing, the Jet JMD-18 Mill Drill Machine is efficient and precise, whether you're working with aluminum, wood, or even ceramic tile. Powered by a UL-listed motor, this high-performance tool has a drilling capacity of 1-1/4 inch and a 15-7/8-inch swing. It also boasts a three-inch face mill capacity, a 3/4-inch end mill capacity, and a host of innovative features, like an easy-to-read internal depth gauge and a worklamp. Extra-Large Work Table for Bigger Jobs Thanks to its extra large, 9.5 x 31.75-inch worktable, the JMD-18 gives you the freedom to tackle larger scale projects that require more space and flexibility. And the included worklamp provides ample illumination of any size work piece, even in dim conditions. 2 HP Motor and Hinged Belt Cover for Power and Fast Results The JMD-18 operates with a powerful UL-listed, 2 HP, one phase, 230-volt motor that gives the tool a range of 12 spindle speeds from 15 to 3,000 RPM. And to minimize delays and wait periods as you transition to different speeds, this motor is also supported by a hinged belt cover that offers faster speed changing. Cast Iron Column and Heavy-Duty Roller Bearings for Support and Stability The JMD-18 has a strong, supportive design. First, a one-piece cast iron column offers additional support where you need it, giving you the freedom to handle heavier material without worry. And heavy-duty, tapered roller bearings support the spindle for greater tolerance and more accurate drilling depth. Easy-Read Depth Gauge and 360-Degree Swiveling Head for Precision Easy to operate, the JMD-18 offers user-friendly features, like satin finished easy-read dials, to guide you through every step of your project.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

Plane away chips, splinters and misshapen edges with the WEN 6 Amp 3-1/4 Inch Electric Hand Planer. Perfect for fixing stubborn doors and fitting wood. This power planer\u2019s 6-Amp motor delivers over 34,000 cuts per minute to your workpiece, slicing away any irregularities until the surface of your boards are aligned and smooth. With a cutting width of 3-1/4 inches and a maximum cutting depth of 1/8 inch, you\u2019ll have the perfect companion for fitting and squaring boards. The 16 positive stops increase in increments of 1/128 inch anywhere from 0 all the way up to 1/8 inches. The base plate shoe even includes a v-shaped groove for easily flattening sharp post corners. Aside from the power planer, this package also includes a dust bag, a rabbeting guide, a kickstand and a parallel fence bracket. The included rabbeting guide adjusts anywhere from 0 to 7/10 inches to allow for rabbets up to an inch deep in size. The parallel fence provides an accurate and straight cut by making sure your strokes are directly parallel to the edge of the wood (a must have for planing door edges, wood trim and boards). The kickstand protects both the blade and the workpiece in between uses by keeping the blade elevated and out of contact from the surface of your project. Finally, the dust bag collects all of your loose shavings to keep your work space clean and sawdust free. The bag attaches to both the left or right hand side of the planer to fit whatever your preference may be. And because this is a WEN Product, your 6 Amp 3-1/4 Inch Electric Hand Planer comes backed by a 2-year warranty, a friendly customer help line, and a nationwide network of skilled service technicians.

The result of their research went into the creation of the Milwaukee 6391-21, arguably the best-built circular saw on the market. For starters, the 6391 has a monster 15-amp, 5,800-rpm motor that produces 3-1/4 horsepower; that\u0092s nearly as powerful as a worm-drive saw, yet this 7-1/4-inch Milwaukee model is more than one third lighter. Look closely and you\u0092ll notice that the blade is mounted on the left side of the motor. That southpaw position gives right-handed users a much clearer view of the cutting line since they no longer have to lean over their arm to see the blade. The 10.4-pound saw\u0092s thick aluminum shoe tilts up to 50 degrees for bevel cutting. The 6391 is also equipped with Milwaukee\u0092s exclusive Tilt-Lok handle that can be adjusted to the most comfortable cutting position: to the rear for vertical cutting, on top for horizontal cutting, or anywhere in between.

These combine a belt driven drill press with the dual coordinate abilities of the milling machine's table for flexibility and efficiency. A locking collet prevents the cutting tool from falling away from the spindle when lateral forces are experienced against the bit. Although light in construction, the JMD Milling Drilling Machines possess the advantages of space-saving versatility, affordability and light machining capability. Amazon.com With its generously sized worktable and hinged belt cover for faster speed changing, the Jet JMD-18 Mill Drill Machine is efficient and precise, whether you're working with aluminum, wood, or even ceramic tile. Powered by a UL-listed motor, this high-performance tool has a drilling capacity of 1-1/4 inch and a 15-7/8-inch swing. It also boasts a three-inch face mill capacity, a 3/4-inch end mill capacity, and a host of innovative features, like an easy-to-read internal depth gauge and a worklamp. Extra-Large Work Table for Bigger Jobs Thanks to its extra large, 9.5 x 31.75-inch worktable, the JMD-18 gives you the freedom to tackle larger scale projects that require more space and flexibility. And the included worklamp provides ample illumination of any size work piece, even in dim conditions. 2 HP Motor and Hinged Belt Cover for Power and Fast Results The JMD-18 operates with a powerful UL-listed, 2 HP, one phase, 230-volt motor that gives the tool a range of 12 spindle speeds from 15 to 3,000 RPM. And to minimize delays and wait periods as you transition to different speeds, this motor is also supported by a hinged belt cover that offers faster speed changing. Cast Iron Column and Heavy-Duty Roller Bearings for Support and Stability The JMD-18 has a strong, supportive design. First, a one-piece cast iron column offers additional support where you need it, giving you the freedom to handle heavier material without worry. And heavy-duty, tapered roller bearings support the spindle for greater tolerance and more accurate drilling depth. Easy-Read Depth Gauge and 360-Degree Swiveling Head for Precision Easy to operate, the JMD-18 offers user-friendly features, like satin finished easy-read dials, to guide you through every step of your project. A positive quick-stop knob combines with an easy-to-read internal depth gauge for consistency, while a 360-degree swiveling head gives you the flexibility you need for precise results. The JMD-18 is backed by a two year warranty. About JET: A History of Sharing New, Feature-Rich Products Opened in 1958 after the founder of the company, Leslie P. Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, Washington to Japan, JET began as a small dealer that sold air hoists and trolleys out of a single hardware store in Seattle. Over the years, JET has carried everything from snowmobiles, transmitter radios, and forklifts to nylon stockings, but by the early 1970s, metalworking had become the base of their business line. And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

Plane away chips, splinters and misshapen edges with the WEN 6 Amp 3-1/4 Inch Electric Hand Planer. Perfect for fixing stubborn doors and fitting wood. This power planer\u2019s 6-Amp motor delivers over 34,000 cuts per minute to your workpiece, slicing away any irregularities until the surface of your boards are aligned and smooth. With a cutting width of 3-1/4 inches and a maximum cutting depth of 1/8 inch, you\u2019ll have the perfect companion for fitting and squaring boards. The 16 positive stops increase in increments of 1/128 inch anywhere from 0 all the way up to 1/8 inches. The base plate shoe even includes a v-shaped groove for easily flattening sharp post corners. Aside from the power planer, this package also includes a dust bag, a rabbeting guide, a kickstand and a parallel fence bracket. The included rabbeting guide adjusts anywhere from 0 to 7/10 inches to allow for rabbets up to an inch deep in size. The parallel fence provides an accurate and straight cut by making sure your strokes are directly parallel to the edge of the wood (a must have for planing door edges, wood trim and boards). The kickstand protects both the blade and the workpiece in between uses by keeping the blade elevated and out of contact from the surface of your project. Finally, the dust bag collects all of your loose shavings to keep your work space clean and sawdust free. The bag attaches to both the left or right hand side of the planer to fit whatever your preference may be. And because this is a WEN Product, your 6 Amp 3-1/4 Inch Electric Hand Planer comes backed by a 2-year warranty, a friendly customer help line, and a nationwide network of skilled service technicians.

Blade, 5800 rpm, Red (6391-21)\tProduct Description Product Description Circular Saw, Blade Dia. 7-1/4 In., Blade Side Left, No Load RPM 5800, Arbor Size 5/8 In., Depth of Cut @ 90 Deg. 2-7/16 In., Depth of Cut @ 45 Deg. 1-13/16 In., Amps 15.0, Tool Length 13-3/4 In., Tool Weight 10.4 lb., Bevel Capacity 50 Degrees, Shoe Material Aircraft Aluminum, Cord Length 9 ft., Number of Conductors 2, Brake Type None, Handle Type Tilt, Voltage 120VAC, Features Superior Visibility, Adjustable Main Handle, Standards UL Listed, CSA Certified When the inquisitive engineers at Milwaukee Tools started asking professional carpenters what they wanted in a portable circular saw, they consistently heard the same three things: pure cutting power, maximum control, and all-day comfort. The result of their research went into the creation of the Milwaukee 6391-21, arguably the best-built circular saw on the market. For starters, the 6391 has a monster 15-amp, 5,800-rpm motor that produces 3-1/4 horsepower; that\u0092s nearly as powerful as a worm-drive saw, yet this 7-1/4-inch Milwaukee model is more than one third lighter. Look closely and you\u0092ll notice that the blade is mounted on the left side of the motor. That southpaw position gives right-handed users a much clearer view of the cutting line since they no longer have to lean over their arm to see the blade. The 10.4-pound saw\u0092s thick aluminum shoe tilts up to 50 degrees for bevel cutting. The 6391 is also equipped with Milwaukee\u0092s exclusive Tilt-Lok handle that can be adjusted to the most comfortable cutting position: to the rear for vertical cutting, on top for horizontal cutting, or anywhere in between. The saw comes with a carbide-tipped saw blade, blade wrench, storage case and owner\u0092s manual. -- Joseph Truini What\u0092s in the BoxCircular saw, carbide-tipped saw blade, blade wrench, storage case, and owner\u0092s manual.

It also boasts a three-inch face mill capacity, a 3/4-inch end mill capacity, and a host of innovative features, like an easy-to-read internal depth gauge and a worklamp. Extra-Large Work Table for Bigger Jobs Thanks to its extra large, 9.5 x 31.75-inch worktable, the JMD-18 gives you the freedom to tackle larger scale projects that require more space and flexibility. And the included worklamp provides ample illumination of any size work piece, even in dim conditions. 2 HP Motor and Hinged Belt Cover for Power and Fast Results The JMD-18 operates with a powerful UL-listed, 2 HP, one phase, 230-volt motor that gives the tool a range of 12 spindle speeds from 15 to 3,000 RPM.

Cast Iron Column and Heavy-Duty Roller Bearings for Support and Stability The JMD-18 has a strong, supportive design. First, a one-piece cast iron column offers additional support where you need it, giving you the freedom to handle heavier material without worry.

Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, Washington to Japan, JET began as a small dealer that sold air hoists and trolleys out of a single hardware store in Seattle. Over the years, JET has carried everything from snowmobiles, transmitter radios, and forklifts to nylon stockings, but by the early 1970s, metalworking had become the base of their business line. And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors. See more Product Description Product Description We see a future built on great brands, great products, and great people. In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty.

Plane away chips, splinters and misshapen edges with the WEN 6 Amp 3-1/4 Inch Electric Hand Planer. Perfect for fixing stubborn doors and fitting wood. This power planer\u2019s 6-Amp motor delivers over 34,000 cuts per minute to your workpiece, slicing away any irregularities until the surface of your boards are aligned and smooth. With a cutting width of 3-1/4 inches and a maximum cutting depth of 1/8 inch, you\u2019ll have the perfect companion for fitting and squaring boards. The 16 positive stops increase in increments of 1/128 inch anywhere from 0 all the way up to 1/8 inches. The base plate shoe even includes a v-shaped groove for easily flattening sharp post corners. Aside from the power planer, this package also includes a dust bag, a rabbeting guide, a kickstand and a parallel fence bracket. The included rabbeting guide adjusts anywhere from 0 to 7/10 inches to allow for rabbets up to an inch deep in size. The parallel fence provides an accurate and straight cut by making sure your strokes are directly parallel to the edge of the wood (a must have for planing door edges, wood trim and boards). The kickstand protects both the blade and the workpiece in between uses by keeping the blade elevated and out of contact from the surface of your project. Finally, the dust bag collects all of your loose shavings to keep your work space clean and sawdust free. The bag attaches to both the left or right hand side of the planer to fit whatever your preference may be. And because this is a WEN Product, your 6 Amp 3-1/4 Inch Electric Hand Planer comes backed by a 2-year warranty, a friendly customer help line, and a nationwide network of skilled service technicians.

Blade, 5800 rpm, Red (6391-21)\tProduct Description Product Description Circular Saw, Blade Dia. 7-1/4 In., Blade Side Left, No Load RPM 5800, Arbor Size 5/8 In., Depth of Cut @ 90 Deg. 2-7/16 In., Depth of Cut @ 45 Deg. 1-13/16 In., Amps 15.0, Tool Length 13-3/4 In., Tool Weight 10.4 lb., Bevel Capacity 50 Degrees, Shoe Material Aircraft Aluminum, Cord Length 9 ft., Number of Conductors 2, Brake Type None, Handle Type Tilt, Voltage 120VAC, Features Superior Visibility, Adjustable Main Handle, Standards UL Listed, CSA Certified When the inquisitive engineers at Milwaukee Tools started asking professional carpenters what they wanted in a portable circular saw, they consistently heard the same three things: pure cutting power, maximum control, and all-day comfort. The result of their research went into the creation of the Milwaukee 6391-21, arguably the best-built circular saw on the market. For starters, the 6391 has a monster 15-amp, 5,800-rpm motor that produces 3-1/4 horsepower; that\u0092s nearly as powerful as a worm-drive saw, yet this 7-1/4-inch Milwaukee model is more than one third lighter. Look closely and you\u0092ll notice that the blade is mounted on the left side of the motor. That southpaw position gives right-handed users a much clearer view of the cutting line since they no longer have to lean over their arm to see the blade. The 10.4-pound saw\u0092s thick aluminum shoe tilts up to 50 degrees for bevel cutting. The 6391 is also equipped with Milwaukee\u0092s exclusive Tilt-Lok handle that can be adjusted to the most comfortable cutting position: to the rear for vertical cutting, on top for horizontal cutting, or anywhere in between. The saw comes with a carbide-tipped saw blade, blade wrench, storage case and owner\u0092s manual. -- Joseph Truini What\u0092s in the BoxCircular saw, carbide-tipped saw blade, blade wrench, storage case, and owner\u0092s manual.
