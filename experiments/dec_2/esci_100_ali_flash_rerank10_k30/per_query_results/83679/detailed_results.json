In its first year the company employed 4 people and built approximately 2,000 fans. As sales continued to grow, the company moved to a larger facility in Capac, Michigan, in 1995. In an unfortunate turn of events, a devastating fire followed the move in January of 1997, resulting in a total loss. Incredibly, the company rebounded much faster than the industry or the community anticipated. In just eleven days Fan-Tastic Vent was able to resume production. In 2010, Fan-Tastic Vent was acquired by Atwood Mobile Products LLC, a leading supplier to the recreation vehicle industry. Today Fan-Tastic Vent continues to be one of the most recognized brand names in the industry and has sold over 3 million fans. Product Description About Fan-Tastic Vent: Fan-Tastic Vent was chartered as a stock corporation in 1984 and in 1985 began production of a 12-volt high efficiency ceiling fan in Burton, Michigan. In its first year the company employed 4 people and built approximately 2,000 fans. As sales continued to grow, the company moved to a larger facility in Capac, Michigan, in 1995. In an unfortunate turn of events, a devastating fire followed the move in January of 1997, resulting in a total loss. Incredibly, the company rebounded much faster than the industry or the community anticipated. In just eleven days Fan-Tastic Vent was able to resume production. In 2010, Fan-Tastic Vent was acquired by Atwood Mobile Products LLC, a leading supplier to the recreation vehicle industry. Today Fan-Tastic Vent continues to be one of the most recognized brand names in the industry and has sold over 3 million fans.From the manufacturer Read more Read more Model 1200 Model 1250 Model 2250 Model 7350 10 blade fan \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Self sealing vent cover \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Multiple fan speeds \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Reversible air flow \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Automated temperature control \u2713 \u2713 Remote control \u2713 Motorized vent cover \u2713 Motorized vent cover \u2713\n\n1270759: Kuuma Stow and Go Propane Tabletop and Mountable Grill - Stainless Steel Gas Grill with Foldable Legs | Great for Camping, Boating, Picnics, Barbeques & More |13,000 BTUs - (58130)\tProduct Description 58130 Features: -Designed for high pressure propane- disposable or larger refillable tanks.

In its first year the company employed 4 people and built approximately 2,000 fans. As sales continued to grow, the company moved to a larger facility in Capac, Michigan, in 1995. In an unfortunate turn of events, a devastating fire followed the move in January of 1997, resulting in a total loss. Incredibly, the company rebounded much faster than the industry or the community anticipated. In just eleven days Fan-Tastic Vent was able to resume production. In 2010, Fan-Tastic Vent was acquired by Atwood Mobile Products LLC, a leading supplier to the recreation vehicle industry. Today Fan-Tastic Vent continues to be one of the most recognized brand names in the industry and has sold over 3 million fans.
