Put on an unpadded bra, grab your tape measure and let's find your bust and band sizes! Fit solutions for bra malfunctions Band Riding Up.If your brand doesn't sit just below your shoulder blades, try tightening the band or losening the straps. If that doesn't help, you need a smaller band. Band Digging In. If your band is digging into your ribs, chest or back, try loosening the band. If that doesn't fix it, you need to go up a band size or try a wider band. Straps Digging In. If your straps are digging in, try loosening them or switching to a bra with padded straps. If that doesn't help, your band \u2013 which should be doing most of the support work \u2013 is too big and it's time to downsize. Slipping Straps. If your straps are sliding around or off the shoulders, they might be stretched out (which happens over time). Or you might be in the wrong cup size causing the straps to sit too wide and slip more easily. Bulging Sides. If you're squeezing out the sides, your band is too small and confining your bust. Go up a band size or try a bra with more cup coverage. Overflowing Cups. If you're spilling out the side, top or bottom of your cups, it's time to trade up. Bigger cups will help keep your bust securely (and comfortably) contained. Gapping Cups. If your cups are gaping a lot or a little, try a smaller cup size so they sit flush with your skin. Dropping Bustline. If your bustline is pulling down, shorten your straps (but not so much they dig) and check your cups (there shouldn't be any gap if they're the right size). If you want even more lift, look to non-stretchy bras with firmer support and rigid straps. Poking Underwires. If your wire pokes, you might be in the wrong cup size. Too small can make the underwire too tight while too big can cause the wire to move around.

Put on an unpadded bra, grab your tape measure and let's find your bust and band sizes! Fit solutions for bra malfunctions Band Riding Up.If your brand doesn't sit just below your shoulder blades, try tightening the band or losening the straps. If that doesn't help, you need a smaller band. Band Digging In. If your band is digging into your ribs, chest or back, try loosening the band. If that doesn't fix it, you need to go up a band size or try a wider band. Straps Digging In. If your straps are digging in, try loosening them or switching to a bra with padded straps. If that doesn't help, your band \u2013 which should be doing most of the support work \u2013 is too big and it's time to downsize. Slipping Straps. If your straps are sliding around or off the shoulders, they might be stretched out (which happens over time). Or you might be in the wrong cup size causing the straps to sit too wide and slip more easily. Bulging Sides. If you're squeezing out the sides, your band is too small and confining your bust. Go up a band size or try a bra with more cup coverage. Overflowing Cups. If you're spilling out the side, top or bottom of your cups, it's time to trade up. Bigger cups will help keep your bust securely (and comfortably) contained. Gapping Cups. If your cups are gaping a lot or a little, try a smaller cup size so they sit flush with your skin. Dropping Bustline. If your bustline is pulling down, shorten your straps (but not so much they dig) and check your cups (there shouldn't be any gap if they're the right size). If you want even more lift, look to non-stretchy bras with firmer support and rigid straps. Poking Underwires. If your wire pokes, you might be in the wrong cup size. Too small can make the underwire too tight while too big can cause the wire to move around. Both lead to uncomfortable poking or prodding.\n\n128941: RUNNING GIRL Stappy Sports Bra for Women Sexy Open Back Medium Support Yoga Bra with Removable Cups\tFrom the brand RUNNING GIRL Yoga bra for women Previous page Workout tops for women Shoulder straps never break\uff01\uff01\uff01 Next page Product Description About us:It\u2019s the freedom of fitness~Mindfully constructed with organic cottons and recycled polyester.Our women\u2019s premium quality bottoms excel with the innovative style you want, and the durability you need.

Put on an unpadded bra, grab your tape measure and let's find your bust and band sizes! Fit solutions for bra malfunctions Band Riding Up.If your brand doesn't sit just below your shoulder blades, try tightening the band or losening the straps. If that doesn't help, you need a smaller band. Band Digging In. If your band is digging into your ribs, chest or back, try loosening the band. If that doesn't fix it, you need to go up a band size or try a wider band. Straps Digging In. If your straps are digging in, try loosening them or switching to a bra with padded straps. If that doesn't help, your band \u2013 which should be doing most of the support work \u2013 is too big and it's time to downsize. Slipping Straps. If your straps are sliding around or off the shoulders, they might be stretched out (which happens over time). Or you might be in the wrong cup size causing the straps to sit too wide and slip more easily. Bulging Sides. If you're squeezing out the sides, your band is too small and confining your bust. Go up a band size or try a bra with more cup coverage. Overflowing Cups. If you're spilling out the side, top or bottom of your cups, it's time to trade up. Bigger cups will help keep your bust securely (and comfortably) contained. Gapping Cups. If your cups are gaping a lot or a little, try a smaller cup size so they sit flush with your skin. Dropping Bustline. If your bustline is pulling down, shorten your straps (but not so much they dig) and check your cups (there shouldn't be any gap if they're the right size). If you want even more lift, look to non-stretchy bras with firmer support and rigid straps. Poking Underwires. If your wire pokes, you might be in the wrong cup size. Too small can make the underwire too tight while too big can cause the wire to move around. Both lead to uncomfortable poking or prodding.\n\n438889: Bali Comfort Revolution Wireless Bra, Full-Coverage Wirefree Bra, Wireless Everyday Bra with Cool Comfort Fabric\tProduct Description Customers tell us that Bali's Comfort Revolution\u00ae full-coverage wireless bra is the most comfortable bra they've ever worn.

Put on an unpadded bra, grab your tape measure and let's find your bust and band sizes! Fit solutions for bra malfunctions Band Riding Up.If your brand doesn't sit just below your shoulder blades, try tightening the band or losening the straps. If that doesn't help, you need a smaller band. Band Digging In. If your band is digging into your ribs, chest or back, try loosening the band. If that doesn't fix it, you need to go up a band size or try a wider band. Straps Digging In. If your straps are digging in, try loosening them or switching to a bra with padded straps. If that doesn't help, your band \u2013 which should be doing most of the support work \u2013 is too big and it's time to downsize. Slipping Straps. If your straps are sliding around or off the shoulders, they might be stretched out (which happens over time). Or you might be in the wrong cup size causing the straps to sit too wide and slip more easily. Bulging Sides. If you're squeezing out the sides, your band is too small and confining your bust. Go up a band size or try a bra with more cup coverage. Overflowing Cups. If you're spilling out the side, top or bottom of your cups, it's time to trade up. Bigger cups will help keep your bust securely (and comfortably) contained. Gapping Cups. If your cups are gaping a lot or a little, try a smaller cup size so they sit flush with your skin. Dropping Bustline. If your bustline is pulling down, shorten your straps (but not so much they dig) and check your cups (there shouldn't be any gap if they're the right size). If you want even more lift, look to non-stretchy bras with firmer support and rigid straps. Poking Underwires. If your wire pokes, you might be in the wrong cup size. Too small can make the underwire too tight while too big can cause the wire to move around. Both lead to uncomfortable poking or prodding.\n\n438889: Bali Comfort Revolution Wireless Bra, Full-Coverage Wirefree Bra, Wireless Everyday Bra with Cool Comfort Fabric\tProduct Description Customers tell us that Bali's Comfort Revolution\u00ae full-coverage wireless bra is the most comfortable bra they've ever worn.
