Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, Washington to Japan, JET began as a small dealer that sold air hoists and trolleys out of a single hardware store in Seattle. Over the years, JET has carried everything from snowmobiles, transmitter radios, and forklifts to nylon stockings, but by the early 1970s, metalworking had become the base of their business line. And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service.

Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, Washington to Japan, JET began as a small dealer that sold air hoists and trolleys out of a single hardware store in Seattle. Over the years, JET has carried everything from snowmobiles, transmitter radios, and forklifts to nylon stockings, but by the early 1970s, metalworking had become the base of their business line. And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service.

NOTE: Pilot hole should be 1/2\u2033 diameter for the Small Bolt and 3/4\u2033 diameter for the Large Bolt. Place the 1/2\u2033 Die over the Small Drive Bolt, with the flat side against the bearing. Insert the Small Drive Bolt through the hole. Note: On some materials it may be helpful to apply light oil to the Punch to help it move freely. Thread the 1/2\u2033 Punch onto the Bolt on the other side of the material, with the blade side facing the material to be cut. Finger-tighten until the Punch is snug against the material. Use a wrench, ratchet, or power tool (not included) to turn the Drive Bolt, driving the Punch into the material. CAUTION! The tool may slip when breaking through. Unthread the Punch to remove the material. If a larger hole is desired, after the hole is opened up using the smaller Punch and Die, repeat the above steps using the Large Drive Screw with a larger Punch and Die pair. After use, clean the Punch, Die, and Bolt by oiling them lightly and carefully wiping them with a dry cloth. Store them in the case in a dry, cool area, out of children\u2019s reach.\n\n1593772: AVID POWER 12V Cordless Drill, Power Drill Set with 22pcs Impact Driver/Drill Bits, 2 Variable Speed, 3/8-Inch Keyless Chuck, 15+1 Torque Setting (Red)\tFrom the brand Previous page 20V Cordless Drills Visit the Store Drill Driver & Screwdrivers Visit the Store Pink Power Tools Visit the Store More Drills/Drill Bit Set Visit the Store Next page Product Description Be Your Excellent Helper for Your Various Home Projects Perfect for tasks around the home, garage, garden and workshop, including drilling holes in wood, plastic and metalas well as driving in/out screw.

These combine a belt driven drill press with the dual coordinate abilities of the milling machine's table for flexibility and efficiency.

NOTE: Pilot hole should be 1/2\u2033 diameter for the Small Bolt and 3/4\u2033 diameter for the Large Bolt. Place the 1/2\u2033 Die over the Small Drive Bolt, with the flat side against the bearing. Insert the Small Drive Bolt through the hole. Note: On some materials it may be helpful to apply light oil to the Punch to help it move freely. Thread the 1/2\u2033 Punch onto the Bolt on the other side of the material, with the blade side facing the material to be cut. Finger-tighten until the Punch is snug against the material. Use a wrench, ratchet, or power tool (not included) to turn the Drive Bolt, driving the Punch into the material. CAUTION! The tool may slip when breaking through. Unthread the Punch to remove the material. If a larger hole is desired, after the hole is opened up using the smaller Punch and Die, repeat the above steps using the Large Drive Screw with a larger Punch and Die pair. After use, clean the Punch, Die, and Bolt by oiling them lightly and carefully wiping them with a dry cloth. Store them in the case in a dry, cool area, out of children\u2019s reach.\n\n1593772: AVID POWER 12V Cordless Drill, Power Drill Set with 22pcs Impact Driver/Drill Bits, 2 Variable Speed, 3/8-Inch Keyless Chuck, 15+1 Torque Setting (Red)\tFrom the brand Previous page 20V Cordless Drills Visit the Store Drill Driver & Screwdrivers Visit the Store Pink Power Tools Visit the Store More Drills/Drill Bit Set Visit the Store Next page Product Description Be Your Excellent Helper for Your Various Home Projects Perfect for tasks around the home, garage, garden and workshop, including drilling holes in wood, plastic and metalas well as driving in/out screw.
