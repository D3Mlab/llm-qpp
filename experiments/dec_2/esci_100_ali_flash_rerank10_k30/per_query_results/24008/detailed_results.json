In 1997 it surpassed \"A Chorus Line\" as the longest running show in Broadway history. On September 10, 2000, after 7,485 shows and a run of nearly 18 years, the show closed - a Broadway record. For the first time ever, an Andrew Lloyd Webber show has been specially filmed and made available on video. With a star cast including Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills, and its stunning production values, Cats will no doubt set a new standard for the filming of all future musicals. Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, the most famous musical of all time, first exploded onto the West End stage in 1981. 'Memory', one of its many classic songs, became an instant worldwide hit. Since then Cats has smashed records and conquered the world. Using the latest technology, all the excitement, thrill, romance and intimacy of this theatrical legend has been captured on screen. Breathtaking visuals and full digital sound (that has been completely re-recorded with a seventy piece orchestra) will lead you deep into the mysterious world of Cats. Cats - as you'll never see it again - more intoxicating and magical than you could possibly imagine. Set Contains: The 30-minute documentary \"What's a Jellicle Cat? The Making of Cats the Video\" provides a backstage look at the video version of the longest-running show in Broadway history. After a brief discussion of the original show's start in 1981, the bulk of the time is spent on the creation of the video and the advantages it had over a stage production--a larger orchestra, clearer lyrics, and close-ups for better story-telling. There's plenty of rehearsal footage, plus comments by Lloyd Webber, director-choreographer Gillian Lynne, Elaine Paige (Grizabella), and other cast members. Of course \"Memory\" is discussed, and an excerpt of it played by the orchestra without vocals is positively gorgeous. --David Horiuchi Product Description Product Description \"Cats\" opened at The Winter Garden on October 7, 1982, carrying an advance of $6.2 million, the largest in Broadway history.

Things that make crinkling and rustling noises. Dangling ball-toys to swat and bat around. These durable, colorful toys will provide hours of entertainment for cats, and for the people watching those cats as well. They'll be especially fun for multiple-cat households, as cats chase each other into and out of the tunnels, have play-fights at the openings, and use them for that grand favorite of cat games: lurk-and-ambush! The layered fabric of the tunnels makes crinkling sounds with every step, adding to the fun and excitement. The spring coil that supports the tunnels allows them to be collapsed down to a small size for storage, travel, or when you want to put a few toys away while company visits. We at Pet Magasin spend countless hours in developing, sourcing, and testing our products. Our primary concerns are that everything we make is safe for pets and their owners, a quality item, and has great value. We source our materials from all over the world: Our scissor sets are made with fine Japanese steel, we buy U.S.-grown cattle hides for our rawhide dog treats, and our catnip is grown in Canada just to name a few. We strive for our products to have style as well as quality . When appropriate, we incorporate cheerful colors without sacrificing the safety and integrity of our products. The items that are used by pet owners are designed to be as ergonomic and comfortable to use as possible. And of course, all of our products are made and sold with your pet's safety, wellbeing, and enjoyment pleasure in mind. Your Order Includes Two Cat Tunnels 1 long (35\") 1 short (18\"). Both are 10\" in diameter. The longer one has a peep hole in the middle, and both of them have hanging ball-toys at one end. Bright, cheerful colors make these fun to have around. Read more A Terrific Interactive Toy For One Or Multiple Cats Cats love to dash into enclosed spaces like tunnels. If you have more than one cat, they'll probably use these to hide and play \"ambush\" with each other. The crinkly fabric adds to the fun. Read more Collapsable To A Small Size For Storage For those times when you don't want cat toys on the floor, these tunnels collapse down small. Each tunnel is actually a fabric-covered spring, so you just squeeze it down and hold it flat with the built-in toggle-ties. Read more There Is No End Of Ways A Cat Can Play With These In addition to hiding in and dashing through, cats will also love tumbling around in these, playing with the tethered ball-toys and trying to \"catch\" the fabric that crinkles under their feet.

In 1997 it surpassed \"A Chorus Line\" as the longest running show in Broadway history. On September 10, 2000, after 7,485 shows and a run of nearly 18 years, the show closed - a Broadway record. For the first time ever, an Andrew Lloyd Webber show has been specially filmed and made available on video. With a star cast including Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills, and its stunning production values, Cats will no doubt set a new standard for the filming of all future musicals. Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, the most famous musical of all time, first exploded onto the West End stage in 1981. 'Memory', one of its many classic songs, became an instant worldwide hit. Since then Cats has smashed records and conquered the world. Using the latest technology, all the excitement, thrill, romance and intimacy of this theatrical legend has been captured on screen. Breathtaking visuals and full digital sound (that has been completely re-recorded with a seventy piece orchestra) will lead you deep into the mysterious world of Cats. Cats - as you'll never see it again - more intoxicating and magical than you could possibly imagine. Set Contains: The 30-minute documentary \"What's a Jellicle Cat? The Making of Cats the Video\" provides a backstage look at the video version of the longest-running show in Broadway history. After a brief discussion of the original show's start in 1981, the bulk of the time is spent on the creation of the video and the advantages it had over a stage production--a larger orchestra, clearer lyrics, and close-ups for better story-telling. There's plenty of rehearsal footage, plus comments by Lloyd Webber, director-choreographer Gillian Lynne, Elaine Paige (Grizabella), and other cast members. Of course \"Memory\" is discussed, and an excerpt of it played by the orchestra without vocals is positively gorgeous. --David Horiuchi Product Description Product Description \"Cats\" opened at The Winter Garden on October 7, 1982, carrying an advance of $6.2 million, the largest in Broadway history.

Things that make crinkling and rustling noises. Dangling ball-toys to swat and bat around. These durable, colorful toys will provide hours of entertainment for cats, and for the people watching those cats as well. They'll be especially fun for multiple-cat households, as cats chase each other into and out of the tunnels, have play-fights at the openings, and use them for that grand favorite of cat games: lurk-and-ambush! The layered fabric of the tunnels makes crinkling sounds with every step, adding to the fun and excitement. The spring coil that supports the tunnels allows them to be collapsed down to a small size for storage, travel, or when you want to put a few toys away while company visits. We at Pet Magasin spend countless hours in developing, sourcing, and testing our products. Our primary concerns are that everything we make is safe for pets and their owners, a quality item, and has great value. We source our materials from all over the world: Our scissor sets are made with fine Japanese steel, we buy U.S.-grown cattle hides for our rawhide dog treats, and our catnip is grown in Canada just to name a few. We strive for our products to have style as well as quality . When appropriate, we incorporate cheerful colors without sacrificing the safety and integrity of our products. The items that are used by pet owners are designed to be as ergonomic and comfortable to use as possible. And of course, all of our products are made and sold with your pet's safety, wellbeing, and enjoyment pleasure in mind. Your Order Includes Two Cat Tunnels 1 long (35\") 1 short (18\"). Both are 10\" in diameter. The longer one has a peep hole in the middle, and both of them have hanging ball-toys at one end. Bright, cheerful colors make these fun to have around. Read more A Terrific Interactive Toy For One Or Multiple Cats Cats love to dash into enclosed spaces like tunnels. If you have more than one cat, they'll probably use these to hide and play \"ambush\" with each other. The crinkly fabric adds to the fun. Read more Collapsable To A Small Size For Storage For those times when you don't want cat toys on the floor, these tunnels collapse down small. Each tunnel is actually a fabric-covered spring, so you just squeeze it down and hold it flat with the built-in toggle-ties. Read more There Is No End Of Ways A Cat Can Play With These In addition to hiding in and dashing through, cats will also love tumbling around in these, playing with the tethered ball-toys and trying to \"catch\" the fabric that crinkles under their feet.

In 1997 it surpassed \"A Chorus Line\" as the longest running show in Broadway history. On September 10, 2000, after 7,485 shows and a run of nearly 18 years, the show closed - a Broadway record. For the first time ever, an Andrew Lloyd Webber show has been specially filmed and made available on video. With a star cast including Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills, and its stunning production values, Cats will no doubt set a new standard for the filming of all future musicals. Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, the most famous musical of all time, first exploded onto the West End stage in 1981. 'Memory', one of its many classic songs, became an instant worldwide hit. Since then Cats has smashed records and conquered the world. Using the latest technology, all the excitement, thrill, romance and intimacy of this theatrical legend has been captured on screen. Breathtaking visuals and full digital sound (that has been completely re-recorded with a seventy piece orchestra) will lead you deep into the mysterious world of Cats. Cats - as you'll never see it again - more intoxicating and magical than you could possibly imagine. Set Contains: The 30-minute documentary \"What's a Jellicle Cat? The Making of Cats the Video\" provides a backstage look at the video version of the longest-running show in Broadway history. After a brief discussion of the original show's start in 1981, the bulk of the time is spent on the creation of the video and the advantages it had over a stage production--a larger orchestra, clearer lyrics, and close-ups for better story-telling. There's plenty of rehearsal footage, plus comments by Lloyd Webber, director-choreographer Gillian Lynne, Elaine Paige (Grizabella), and other cast members. Of course \"Memory\" is discussed, and an excerpt of it played by the orchestra without vocals is positively gorgeous. --David Horiuchi Product Description Product Description \"Cats\" opened at The Winter Garden on October 7, 1982, carrying an advance of $6.2 million, the largest in Broadway history.

Things that make crinkling and rustling noises. Dangling ball-toys to swat and bat around. These durable, colorful toys will provide hours of entertainment for cats, and for the people watching those cats as well. They'll be especially fun for multiple-cat households, as cats chase each other into and out of the tunnels, have play-fights at the openings, and use them for that grand favorite of cat games: lurk-and-ambush! The layered fabric of the tunnels makes crinkling sounds with every step, adding to the fun and excitement. The spring coil that supports the tunnels allows them to be collapsed down to a small size for storage, travel, or when you want to put a few toys away while company visits. We at Pet Magasin spend countless hours in developing, sourcing, and testing our products. Our primary concerns are that everything we make is safe for pets and their owners, a quality item, and has great value. We source our materials from all over the world: Our scissor sets are made with fine Japanese steel, we buy U.S.-grown cattle hides for our rawhide dog treats, and our catnip is grown in Canada just to name a few. We strive for our products to have style as well as quality . When appropriate, we incorporate cheerful colors without sacrificing the safety and integrity of our products. The items that are used by pet owners are designed to be as ergonomic and comfortable to use as possible. And of course, all of our products are made and sold with your pet's safety, wellbeing, and enjoyment pleasure in mind. Your Order Includes Two Cat Tunnels 1 long (35\") 1 short (18\"). Both are 10\" in diameter. The longer one has a peep hole in the middle, and both of them have hanging ball-toys at one end. Bright, cheerful colors make these fun to have around. Read more A Terrific Interactive Toy For One Or Multiple Cats Cats love to dash into enclosed spaces like tunnels. If you have more than one cat, they'll probably use these to hide and play \"ambush\" with each other. The crinkly fabric adds to the fun. Read more Collapsable To A Small Size For Storage For those times when you don't want cat toys on the floor, these tunnels collapse down small. Each tunnel is actually a fabric-covered spring, so you just squeeze it down and hold it flat with the built-in toggle-ties.
