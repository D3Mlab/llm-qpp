We currently offer thousands of different parts and accessories on our website, all designed to make your ride better. So you could say we have a little experience when it comes to giving off-roaders what they want. SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too. Next page Product Description Replaces OEM Part #: 2202015 3235500 3235616 FEATURES Heavy-Duty U-Series U-Joint Direct Polaris OEM replacement needle bearing U-joint Twice as strong as stock For riders that are tired of breaking weak OEM U-joints 4340 chromoly steel body 3-month replacement against breakage Polaris Heavy Duty Replacement U-Joint Bigger, Better U-Joints We were tired of blowing U-joints and ruining our ride, that\u2019s why we built better, stronger U-joints that can handle the power of any Polaris UTV or ATV. Our heavy-duty U-joint is twice as strong as stock. Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts. Heavy-Duty U-Series: A Super Strong U-Joint Upgrade We make our replacement Heavy-Duty U-joint with 4340 chromoly steel whereas stock is made from plain carbon steel. That change alone makes our U-joint twice as strong as stock, so you can count on it to keep you going. You\u2019ll get that confidence back to drive harder and keep the pedal down longer without worrying about damaging your drive-train or prop shaft.

It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way.

About Thule Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since.

We currently offer thousands of different parts and accessories on our website, all designed to make your ride better.

SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career.

Our heavy-duty U-joint is twice as strong as stock. Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts. Heavy-Duty U-Series: A Super Strong U-Joint Upgrade We make our replacement Heavy-Duty U-joint with 4340 chromoly steel whereas stock is made from plain carbon steel. That change alone makes our U-joint twice as strong as stock, so you can count on it to keep you going. You\u2019ll get that confidence back to drive harder and keep the pedal down longer without worrying about damaging your drive-train or prop shaft.

It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way.

About Thule Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.

We currently offer thousands of different parts and accessories on our website, all designed to make your ride better. So you could say we have a little experience when it comes to giving off-roaders what they want. SuperATV Visit the Store Enjoy The Ride When nothing stands between you, the weekend, and your side-by-side, you're bound to catch those \"living for the next ride\" vibes. How did we get our start? It\u2019s a story of humble beginnings and a lot of passion. There\u2019s talent, perseverance, and a number of good business decisions in that story. The story of how SuperATV began is really the story of how Harold Hunt decided to take his passion and turn it into a career. He wanted a quality lift kit for his Sportsman but couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So what did he do? He made one. And after designing, fabricating, and testing his very first homemade lift kit, he thought other people might like to have it too. Next page Product Description Replaces OEM Part #: 2202015 3235500 3235616 FEATURES Heavy-Duty U-Series U-Joint Direct Polaris OEM replacement needle bearing U-joint Twice as strong as stock For riders that are tired of breaking weak OEM U-joints 4340 chromoly steel body 3-month replacement against breakage Polaris Heavy Duty Replacement U-Joint Bigger, Better U-Joints We were tired of blowing U-joints and ruining our ride, that\u2019s why we built better, stronger U-joints that can handle the power of any Polaris UTV or ATV. Our heavy-duty U-joint is twice as strong as stock. Our Super-Duty Needleless U-Joint is nearly 3X stronger than stock and is the perfect replacement or upgrade to increase the longevity of both your OEM and SuperATV Polaris prop shafts. Heavy-Duty U-Series: A Super Strong U-Joint Upgrade We make our replacement Heavy-Duty U-joint with 4340 chromoly steel whereas stock is made from plain carbon steel. That change alone makes our U-joint twice as strong as stock, so you can count on it to keep you going. You\u2019ll get that confidence back to drive harder and keep the pedal down longer without worrying about damaging your drive-train or prop shaft.

It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way.

About Thule Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since.
