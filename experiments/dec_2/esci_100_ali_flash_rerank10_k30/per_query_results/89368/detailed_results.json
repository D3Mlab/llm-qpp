Read more The Importance of Cell Salts History of Cell Salts Dr. Wilhelm Scheussler, a German doctor, established the theory of Biochemic medicine in 1873. Dr. Scheussler combined the principles of biochemistry with homeopathy to give us the 12 safe and natural Cell Salts, each derived from one of the 12 inorganic mineral compounds most important to our cellular health. The Importance of Cell Salts Cell salts stimulate the body\u2019s natural healing mechanisms to satisy mineral imbalances. In his biochemic theory, Dr. Schuessler, the discoverer of cell salts, states that deficiencies in these minerals are the source of common health problems and the cell salts derived from these minerals give the body what it needs to treat illness and be well. On-The-Go Cell salts can be added to your water bottle and sipped throughout the day. Cell Salts give families the flexibility and assurance of safety to treat minor health issues quickly and effectively. Cell Salts will not react with other medications and can complement a healthy living plan. Remember to follow all label directions. Read more FAQs Are These Herbal Medicines? No. While many homeopathic ingredients are derived from plants, their processing and highly-defined principles of application are a system of medicine unique to homeopathy. Homeopathic medicines are not herbs or supplements, and they have been regulated by the FDA as medicine since 1938. What Role does the FDA have in Homeopathy? While the FDA uses the same rules and regulations it applies to other forms of medicine to oversee and scrutinize homeopathic manufacturing and production, the uses for our products are based on traditional homeopathic practice. They have not been reviewed by the FDA. What If I Am Lactose Intolerant Or Sensitive To Milk? Our small, soft tablets dissolve instantly in the mouth.

Bioplasma Tablets A Combination of 12 Mineral Cell Salts Hyland\u2019s Bioplasma helps bring balance to your body by providing a combination of the essential 12 mineral cell salts that are vital to cellular health and function. Cell salts satisfy mineral imbalances in the body, stimulating the body\u2019s natural healing process. When we lack these important cell salts, we are more vulnerable to common health concerns. By replenishing them, you are better prepared to treat illnesses and enjoy better overall wellness. Read more The Importance of Cell Salts History of Cell Salts Dr. Wilhelm Scheussler, a German doctor, established the theory of Biochemic medicine in 1873. Dr. Scheussler combined the principles of biochemistry with homeopathy to give us the 12 safe and natural Cell Salts, each derived from one of the 12 inorganic mineral compounds most important to our cellular health. The Importance of Cell Salts Cell salts stimulate the natural healing mechanisms to satisy mineral imbalances. In his biochemic theory, Dr. Schuessler, the discoverer of cell salts, states that deficiencies in these minerals are the source of common health problems and the cell salts derived from these minerals give the body what it needs to treat illness and be well. On-The-Go Cell salts can be added to your water bottle and sipped throughout the day. Cell Salts give families the flexibility and confidence of safety to treat minor health issues quickly and effectively. Cell Salts will not react with other medications and can complement a healthy living plan. Remember to follow all label directions. Read more FAQs Are These Herbal Medicines?

Read more The Importance of Cell Salts History of Cell Salts Dr. Wilhelm Scheussler, a German doctor, established the theory of Biochemic medicine in 1873. Dr. Scheussler combined the principles of biochemistry with homeopathy to give us the 12 safe and natural Cell Salts, each derived from one of the 12 inorganic mineral compounds most important to our cellular health. The Importance of Cell Salts Cell salts stimulate the body\u2019s natural healing mechanisms to satisy mineral imbalances. In his biochemic theory, Dr. Schuessler, the discoverer of cell salts, states that deficiencies in these minerals are the source of common health problems and the cell salts derived from these minerals give the body what it needs to treat illness and be well. On-The-Go Cell salts can be added to your water bottle and sipped throughout the day. Cell Salts give families the flexibility and assurance of safety to treat minor health issues quickly and effectively. Cell Salts will not react with other medications and can complement a healthy living plan. Remember to follow all label directions. Read more FAQs Are These Herbal Medicines? No. While many homeopathic ingredients are derived from plants, their processing and highly-defined principles of application are a system of medicine unique to homeopathy. Homeopathic medicines are not herbs or supplements, and they have been regulated by the FDA as medicine since 1938. What Role does the FDA have in Homeopathy? While the FDA uses the same rules and regulations it applies to other forms of medicine to oversee and scrutinize homeopathic manufacturing and production, the uses for our products are based on traditional homeopathic practice.

Bioplasma Tablets A Combination of 12 Mineral Cell Salts Hyland\u2019s Bioplasma helps bring balance to your body by providing a combination of the essential 12 mineral cell salts that are vital to cellular health and function. Cell salts satisfy mineral imbalances in the body, stimulating the body\u2019s natural healing process. When we lack these important cell salts, we are more vulnerable to common health concerns. By replenishing them, you are better prepared to treat illnesses and enjoy better overall wellness. Read more The Importance of Cell Salts History of Cell Salts Dr. Wilhelm Scheussler, a German doctor, established the theory of Biochemic medicine in 1873. Dr. Scheussler combined the principles of biochemistry with homeopathy to give us the 12 safe and natural Cell Salts, each derived from one of the 12 inorganic mineral compounds most important to our cellular health. The Importance of Cell Salts Cell salts stimulate the natural healing mechanisms to satisy mineral imbalances. In his biochemic theory, Dr. Schuessler, the discoverer of cell salts, states that deficiencies in these minerals are the source of common health problems and the cell salts derived from these minerals give the body what it needs to treat illness and be well. On-The-Go Cell salts can be added to your water bottle and sipped throughout the day. Cell Salts give families the flexibility and confidence of safety to treat minor health issues quickly and effectively. Cell Salts will not react with other medications and can complement a healthy living plan. Remember to follow all label directions. Read more FAQs Are These Herbal Medicines?

Read more The Importance of Cell Salts History of Cell Salts Dr. Wilhelm Scheussler, a German doctor, established the theory of Biochemic medicine in 1873. Dr. Scheussler combined the principles of biochemistry with homeopathy to give us the 12 safe and natural Cell Salts, each derived from one of the 12 inorganic mineral compounds most important to our cellular health. The Importance of Cell Salts Cell salts stimulate the body\u2019s natural healing mechanisms to satisy mineral imbalances. In his biochemic theory, Dr. Schuessler, the discoverer of cell salts, states that deficiencies in these minerals are the source of common health problems and the cell salts derived from these minerals give the body what it needs to treat illness and be well. On-The-Go Cell salts can be added to your water bottle and sipped throughout the day. Cell Salts give families the flexibility and assurance of safety to treat minor health issues quickly and effectively. Cell Salts will not react with other medications and can complement a healthy living plan. Remember to follow all label directions. Read more FAQs Are These Herbal Medicines? No. While many homeopathic ingredients are derived from plants, their processing and highly-defined principles of application are a system of medicine unique to homeopathy. Homeopathic medicines are not herbs or supplements, and they have been regulated by the FDA as medicine since 1938. What Role does the FDA have in Homeopathy? While the FDA uses the same rules and regulations it applies to other forms of medicine to oversee and scrutinize homeopathic manufacturing and production, the uses for our products are based on traditional homeopathic practice. They have not been reviewed by the FDA. What If I Am Lactose Intolerant Or Sensitive To Milk? Our small, soft tablets dissolve instantly in the mouth. These quick-dissolve tablets contain pure Lactose N.F. (National Formulary), which is without casein, whey or the other milk proteins, which are usually the triggers in reactions to dairy products. Most people are able to use our products as the amount of this pure lactose is relatively small.
