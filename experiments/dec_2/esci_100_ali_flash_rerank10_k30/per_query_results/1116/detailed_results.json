National Pipe Taper (NPT) threads create a tighter seal than straight threads. The fitting is made of gray PVC (polyvinyl chloride) for chemical and corrosion resistance, high strength, and less weight than fittings made from metal. It is compatible with schedule 40 PVC pipes and fittings and is suitable for cold-water pressure distribution systems including irrigation, pool and spa, potable water, and chilled water applications. PVC can be connected to other materials such as steel, copper, or cast iron using transition fittings. The fitting has a maximum operating temperature of 140 degrees F, meets ASTM International D1784 and D2466 standards for quality assurance, and is certified by National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF) for potable water service. This schedule 40 PVC cap fitting is suitable for closing or terminating pipes used for conveying drinking water, waste water, chemicals, and other liquids in a range of industries. Pipe fittings are components used for connecting, terminating, controlling flow, and changing the direction of piping in many different industries. When purchasing pipe fittings, consider the application, as this will affect material type, shape, size and required durability. Fittings are available threaded or unthreaded, in many shapes, styles, sizes, and schedules (pipe wall thickness). Spears Manufacturing produces thermoplastic fittings and valves for fluid, drain, waste, and vent systems. The company, founded in 1969 and headquartered in Sylmar, CA, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001.

When purchasing pipe fittings, consider the application, as this will affect material type, shape, size and required durability. Fittings are available threaded or unthreaded, in many shapes, styles, sizes, and schedules (pipe wall thickness). Merit Brass manufactures pipe nipples following ISO 9001 standards for quality assurance. Family-owned since 1937, the company is based in Cleveland, OH. Merit Brass distributes pipe fittings to the United States and Canada. Product Description The Merit Brass lead-free brass pipe fitting is a 45-degree street elbow with male and female National Pipe Taper (NPT) threads for connecting two pipes to change the direction of flow. Lead-free brass is comparable in strength to stainless steel and is more corrosion resistant. The pressure ratings for this elbow are 125 psi for steam and 200 psi for water, oil, and gas (W.O.G.), and it meets standards ASTM B-584-06 (C89833), ANSI B 1.20.1, and ANSI B 16.15 for quality assurance.
