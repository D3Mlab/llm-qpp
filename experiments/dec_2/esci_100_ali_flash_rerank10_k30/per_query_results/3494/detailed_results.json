They are outstanding silver/copper hybrid analog balanced interconnects that are sonically revealing without the harshness associated with most pure silver balanced interconnects. Whether you are looking to maximize the dynamics of your home theater system or 2-channel system, you will enjoy silky-smooth audio using our advanced, low-loss conductors and industry-low capacitance measurements. Silky-smooth audio using our advanced TFE (Teflon) insulation. This audio cable is a dual conductor, twisted pair configuration. The Blue Truth balanced XLR audio cables feature 99.999% pure silver coated conductors. Plus an equally pure silver coated shield will put you in sonic heaven. Balanced lines are the preferred method (for hum free) interconnecting of sound systems using a shielded twisted-pair. The principal behind balanced lines is that the signal is transmitted over one wire and received back on another wire. The shield does not carry any information, thus it is free to function as a true shield. This circuit's shining virtue is its great common-mode noise rejection ability. The concept here relies on induced noise showing up equally (or common) on each wire. It is mainly due to EMI (electromagnetic interference: passing through or near magnetic fields), RFI (radio frequency interference: strong broadcast signals), noisy ground references, or a combination of all three. Our Blue Truth XLR cables exhibit exactly equal impedance from each line relative to ground, ensuring equal noise susceptibility. Since the balanced input stage amplifies only the difference between the lines, it rejects everything else (noise) that is common to the lines. Blue Truth Cables Proven Track Record Of Delighting Customer Better Cables high-performance cables rival the performance of much more expensive cables sold through traditional sources. Better Cables cable is made in the USA, and assembled in the USA using audiophile-grade connectors to marry with our extraordinary cable. Get Maximum Performance From Your Audio System Ultra High Performance, Ultra High Value Better Cables audio cables feature high-purity silver and oxygen-free copper conductors for high-performance audio playback. Our flagship Blue Truth line of audio cables is constructed with silver conductors and high-end connectors. Whether you are using the latest audiophile streaming media player, pre-amp, cd player, phonograph, receiver, or high-end amplifier, these audio cables provide unsurpassed sonic fidelity, detail, and clarity. Great for any stereo or multi-channel audio application - including High-Resolution Streaming Media, SACD, CD Features Audiophile-grade Male to Female Neutrik XLR connectors Low 29 pF/ft capacitance TFE Teflon dielectric insulation Flexible stranded-core silver-coated conductors Cold welded silver-coated Neutrik XLR connectors Instantly improves your home theater or home audio experience Larger conductors for extremely low-loss connections Read more Silver-The Conductivity KING! Silver is the conductivity KING when It comes to audio cables. Gold is good, copper is great, but silver is the best ! Blue Truth Balanced XLR cables contain silver in the conductor. Silver, a precious metal, is the ONLY metal with a higher electrical conductivity than copper. Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables use 99.999% pure silver. The electrical conductivity of silver is 106% of that of annealed copper on the IACS scale. Even though the cost of silver is much greater than copper, its sonic benefits are immediately apparent. High-Purity Copper We also use ultra-pure copper in our Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables. The addition of copper brings \u201cwarmth\u201d to the audio sound-complementing the sonic detail from the silver. The Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables strike a unique balance between outstanding performance and cost. The Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables are considered a true \u201cvalue\u201d in the world of high-end audio cables. BETTER CABLES - A Name You Can Trust Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables are extremely well shielded against RFI and EMI.

(.75m) Green\tProduct Description The audio frontier is all abuzz these days with the pleasure possible though HDMI USB FireWire and Ethernet connections. However these current generation digital technologies are only part of the story just as the challenge of designing manufacturing and choosing the best analog interconnects and speaker cables is as important as ever. S/P-DIF is transmitted through Digital Coax and Toslink fiber optics (EIA-J) making them still some of the most important cables in electronic entertainment. While thanks to HDMI Toslink is not so often used to connect a DVD player to an A/V receiver Toslink connectors are common on cable-boxes TV sets subwoofers all sorts of products. For these many reasons AudioQuest has refined and renewed our line of serious high performance OptiLink cables. When the question is \u201chow can a fiber-optic cable change the sound?\u201d \u2026 the answer is easier to explain than for almost any other type of cable. If the light source were a coherent laser firing into a vacuum all the light would stay straight arriving at its destination at the same time. Even if the LED light source in a Toslink system were coherent the light entering a fiber-optic cable is scattered and dispersed by imperfections and impurities in the fiber. This can be measured as a loss of amplitude \u2026 but amplitude is not the problem a 50% true loss would have no effect on sound quality. The problem is that the dispersed light does get through the cable but only after it has taken a longer path like a pool ball bouncing off the side-rails causing it to arrive later. This delayed part of the signal prevents the computer charged with decoding this information from being able to decode properly or even at all. The inability to decode shows first at higher frequencies (not audio frequencies this is a mono stream of digital audio information) so reduced bandwidth is a measurable signature of light being dispersed by a fiber. The punch line: The less dispersion in the fiber the less Product Description The audio frontier is all abuzz these days with the pleasure possible though HDMI USB FireWire and Ethernet connections.

They are outstanding silver/copper hybrid analog balanced interconnects that are sonically revealing without the harshness associated with most pure silver balanced interconnects. Whether you are looking to maximize the dynamics of your home theater system or 2-channel system, you will enjoy silky-smooth audio using our advanced, low-loss conductors and industry-low capacitance measurements. Silky-smooth audio using our advanced TFE (Teflon) insulation. This audio cable is a dual conductor, twisted pair configuration. The Blue Truth balanced XLR audio cables feature 99.999% pure silver coated conductors. Plus an equally pure silver coated shield will put you in sonic heaven. Balanced lines are the preferred method (for hum free) interconnecting of sound systems using a shielded twisted-pair. The principal behind balanced lines is that the signal is transmitted over one wire and received back on another wire. The shield does not carry any information, thus it is free to function as a true shield. This circuit's shining virtue is its great common-mode noise rejection ability. The concept here relies on induced noise showing up equally (or common) on each wire. It is mainly due to EMI (electromagnetic interference: passing through or near magnetic fields), RFI (radio frequency interference: strong broadcast signals), noisy ground references, or a combination of all three. Our Blue Truth XLR cables exhibit exactly equal impedance from each line relative to ground, ensuring equal noise susceptibility. Since the balanced input stage amplifies only the difference between the lines, it rejects everything else (noise) that is common to the lines. Blue Truth Cables Proven Track Record Of Delighting Customer Better Cables high-performance cables rival the performance of much more expensive cables sold through traditional sources. Better Cables cable is made in the USA, and assembled in the USA using audiophile-grade connectors to marry with our extraordinary cable. Get Maximum Performance From Your Audio System Ultra High Performance, Ultra High Value Better Cables audio cables feature high-purity silver and oxygen-free copper conductors for high-performance audio playback. Our flagship Blue Truth line of audio cables is constructed with silver conductors and high-end connectors. Whether you are using the latest audiophile streaming media player, pre-amp, cd player, phonograph, receiver, or high-end amplifier, these audio cables provide unsurpassed sonic fidelity, detail, and clarity. Great for any stereo or multi-channel audio application - including High-Resolution Streaming Media, SACD, CD Features Audiophile-grade Male to Female Neutrik XLR connectors Low 29 pF/ft capacitance TFE Teflon dielectric insulation Flexible stranded-core silver-coated conductors Cold welded silver-coated Neutrik XLR connectors Instantly improves your home theater or home audio experience Larger conductors for extremely low-loss connections Read more Silver-The Conductivity KING! Silver is the conductivity KING when It comes to audio cables. Gold is good, copper is great, but silver is the best ! Blue Truth Balanced XLR cables contain silver in the conductor. Silver, a precious metal, is the ONLY metal with a higher electrical conductivity than copper. Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables use 99.999% pure silver. The electrical conductivity of silver is 106% of that of annealed copper on the IACS scale. Even though the cost of silver is much greater than copper, its sonic benefits are immediately apparent. High-Purity Copper We also use ultra-pure copper in our Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables. The addition of copper brings \u201cwarmth\u201d to the audio sound-complementing the sonic detail from the silver. The Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables strike a unique balance between outstanding performance and cost. The Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables are considered a true \u201cvalue\u201d in the world of high-end audio cables. BETTER CABLES - A Name You Can Trust Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables are extremely well shielded against RFI and EMI.

(.75m) Green\tProduct Description The audio frontier is all abuzz these days with the pleasure possible though HDMI USB FireWire and Ethernet connections. However these current generation digital technologies are only part of the story just as the challenge of designing manufacturing and choosing the best analog interconnects and speaker cables is as important as ever. S/P-DIF is transmitted through Digital Coax and Toslink fiber optics (EIA-J) making them still some of the most important cables in electronic entertainment. While thanks to HDMI Toslink is not so often used to connect a DVD player to an A/V receiver Toslink connectors are common on cable-boxes TV sets subwoofers all sorts of products. For these many reasons AudioQuest has refined and renewed our line of serious high performance OptiLink cables. When the question is \u201chow can a fiber-optic cable change the sound?\u201d \u2026 the answer is easier to explain than for almost any other type of cable. If the light source were a coherent laser firing into a vacuum all the light would stay straight arriving at its destination at the same time. Even if the LED light source in a Toslink system were coherent the light entering a fiber-optic cable is scattered and dispersed by imperfections and impurities in the fiber. This can be measured as a loss of amplitude \u2026 but amplitude is not the problem a 50% true loss would have no effect on sound quality. The problem is that the dispersed light does get through the cable but only after it has taken a longer path like a pool ball bouncing off the side-rails causing it to arrive later. This delayed part of the signal prevents the computer charged with decoding this information from being able to decode properly or even at all. The inability to decode shows first at higher frequencies (not audio frequencies this is a mono stream of digital audio information) so reduced bandwidth is a measurable signature of light being dispersed by a fiber. The punch line: The less dispersion in the fiber the less Product Description The audio frontier is all abuzz these days with the pleasure possible though HDMI USB FireWire and Ethernet connections.

They are outstanding silver/copper hybrid analog balanced interconnects that are sonically revealing without the harshness associated with most pure silver balanced interconnects. Whether you are looking to maximize the dynamics of your home theater system or 2-channel system, you will enjoy silky-smooth audio using our advanced, low-loss conductors and industry-low capacitance measurements. Silky-smooth audio using our advanced TFE (Teflon) insulation. This audio cable is a dual conductor, twisted pair configuration. The Blue Truth balanced XLR audio cables feature 99.999% pure silver coated conductors. Plus an equally pure silver coated shield will put you in sonic heaven. Balanced lines are the preferred method (for hum free) interconnecting of sound systems using a shielded twisted-pair. The principal behind balanced lines is that the signal is transmitted over one wire and received back on another wire. The shield does not carry any information, thus it is free to function as a true shield. This circuit's shining virtue is its great common-mode noise rejection ability. The concept here relies on induced noise showing up equally (or common) on each wire. It is mainly due to EMI (electromagnetic interference: passing through or near magnetic fields), RFI (radio frequency interference: strong broadcast signals), noisy ground references, or a combination of all three. Our Blue Truth XLR cables exhibit exactly equal impedance from each line relative to ground, ensuring equal noise susceptibility. Since the balanced input stage amplifies only the difference between the lines, it rejects everything else (noise) that is common to the lines. Blue Truth Cables Proven Track Record Of Delighting Customer Better Cables high-performance cables rival the performance of much more expensive cables sold through traditional sources. Better Cables cable is made in the USA, and assembled in the USA using audiophile-grade connectors to marry with our extraordinary cable. Get Maximum Performance From Your Audio System Ultra High Performance, Ultra High Value Better Cables audio cables feature high-purity silver and oxygen-free copper conductors for high-performance audio playback. Our flagship Blue Truth line of audio cables is constructed with silver conductors and high-end connectors. Whether you are using the latest audiophile streaming media player, pre-amp, cd player, phonograph, receiver, or high-end amplifier, these audio cables provide unsurpassed sonic fidelity, detail, and clarity. Great for any stereo or multi-channel audio application - including High-Resolution Streaming Media, SACD, CD Features Audiophile-grade Male to Female Neutrik XLR connectors Low 29 pF/ft capacitance TFE Teflon dielectric insulation Flexible stranded-core silver-coated conductors Cold welded silver-coated Neutrik XLR connectors Instantly improves your home theater or home audio experience Larger conductors for extremely low-loss connections Read more Silver-The Conductivity KING! Silver is the conductivity KING when It comes to audio cables. Gold is good, copper is great, but silver is the best ! Blue Truth Balanced XLR cables contain silver in the conductor. Silver, a precious metal, is the ONLY metal with a higher electrical conductivity than copper. Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables use 99.999% pure silver. The electrical conductivity of silver is 106% of that of annealed copper on the IACS scale. Even though the cost of silver is much greater than copper, its sonic benefits are immediately apparent. High-Purity Copper We also use ultra-pure copper in our Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables. The addition of copper brings \u201cwarmth\u201d to the audio sound-complementing the sonic detail from the silver. The Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables strike a unique balance between outstanding performance and cost. The Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables are considered a true \u201cvalue\u201d in the world of high-end audio cables. BETTER CABLES - A Name You Can Trust Blue Truth Balanced XLR audio cables are extremely well shielded against RFI and EMI.

(.75m) Green\tProduct Description The audio frontier is all abuzz these days with the pleasure possible though HDMI USB FireWire and Ethernet connections. However these current generation digital technologies are only part of the story just as the challenge of designing manufacturing and choosing the best analog interconnects and speaker cables is as important as ever. S/P-DIF is transmitted through Digital Coax and Toslink fiber optics (EIA-J) making them still some of the most important cables in electronic entertainment. While thanks to HDMI Toslink is not so often used to connect a DVD player to an A/V receiver Toslink connectors are common on cable-boxes TV sets subwoofers all sorts of products. For these many reasons AudioQuest has refined and renewed our line of serious high performance OptiLink cables. When the question is \u201chow can a fiber-optic cable change the sound?\u201d \u2026 the answer is easier to explain than for almost any other type of cable. If the light source were a coherent laser firing into a vacuum all the light would stay straight arriving at its destination at the same time. Even if the LED light source in a Toslink system were coherent the light entering a fiber-optic cable is scattered and dispersed by imperfections and impurities in the fiber. This can be measured as a loss of amplitude \u2026 but amplitude is not the problem a 50% true loss would have no effect on sound quality. The problem is that the dispersed light does get through the cable but only after it has taken a longer path like a pool ball bouncing off the side-rails causing it to arrive later. This delayed part of the signal prevents the computer charged with decoding this information from being able to decode properly or even at all. The inability to decode shows first at higher frequencies (not audio frequencies this is a mono stream of digital audio information) so reduced bandwidth is a measurable signature of light being dispersed by a fiber. The punch line: The less dispersion in the fiber the less Product Description The audio frontier is all abuzz these days with the pleasure possible though HDMI USB FireWire and Ethernet connections.
