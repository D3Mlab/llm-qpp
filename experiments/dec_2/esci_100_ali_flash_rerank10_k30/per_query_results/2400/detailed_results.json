Coleman could see the light for the darkness. The young salesman was taking a stroll after a hard day\u2019s work selling typewriters, and spotted a new type of lamplight in a drugstore window in Brockton, Alabama. This new light burned with a strong, steady white flame and was fueled by gasoline. The standard lamp of the era burned kerosene and produced a smoky, flickering, yellowish light. W.C. was stricken with very poor eyesight, and was very interested in this new, steady white light that enabled him to read even the smallest print in books and on medicine bottles. Coleman saw potential in the new light, and through his vision a new company was born that would put America\u2019s farms and ranches in a new light, and would eventually make his name synonymous with outdoor fun.

Cal-Chlor Chlorine Granular is a strong pool shock treatment which is used to kill algae and bacteria as well as other harmful water contaminants. It is also a great shock to use for Spring pool openings. Use our Cal-Chlor Chlorine Granular to kill visible algae blooms and invisible bacteria, which could cause illness to swimmers. Your daily chlorination of the pool will kill most bacteria and other contaminants. To be sure that the water is completely sanitary, it is best to super chlorinate by shocking the pool every few weeks. Doing this also allows you to oxidize everything in the water, especially the various contaminants that may exist in the water. Clear, healthy water requires a powerful shock Powerful chlorine shock treatment that is great for regular maintenance Main active ingredient is 68% Calcium Hypochlorite (Cal-Hypo) for quick sanitizing Must pre-dissolve/dilute to prevent bleaching of vinyl liner surfaces Dosage: 1 Pound per 10,000 gallons Read more In The Swim's Recommended Pool Care Pool Care and Maintenance It is important to maintain your pool/spa to keep it clean and healthy all year round. Good habits, such as cleaning your filter or emptying your skimmer basket, will ensure that your investment is protected for years to come. But most importantly, you and your family will be able to enjoy the swimming pool or spa each season. Water Testing Testing the water weekly or bi-weekly, depending on use and outside variables, helps keep your pool/spa water healthy. Utilizing a DPD or OTO reagent-based water test kit, test strips, or digital testing will help you monitor the pool or spa water chemistry. Adjusting and Balancing Adjusting and balancing your pool or spa water chemistry ensures that you will get the most out of the swimming season. The benefit of having good pH and Alkalinity levels is that it will increase the ability of your main sanitizer to kill bacteria. Balanced pool water chemistry will also reduce chemical and maintenance costs. Balanced pH and alkalinity help prevent corrosion and scale formation on the interior pool surface and surrounding equipment. Read more Sanitizing There are many different types of sanitizers used in various pool and spa environments. Clean and healthy water starts by establishing a proper residual chlorine level with shock or concentrated granular chlorine. The most common way to maintain a proper chlorine level is by using trichlor chlorine tablets in either a floater or chemical feeder. Applying these steps to your normal maintenance plan will ensure the elimination of non-living organic contaminants, bacteria, micro organisms, and algae making your water safe to enjoy. Pool Fun and Safety Now that the water is properly balanced and sanitized, it\u2019s time to get in there and have some fun! We recommend enhancing your outdoor living environment with games, floats or loungers, toys, and accessories. Get creative! Safety is of the utmost importance, and there are many ways to help make your pool/spa safer. Having a life ring buoy, a shepherd's hook, depth markers, coast guard-approved life preservers, door and water alarms and having your local aquatic environment safety regulations on-hand will ensure a fun and safe environment for your family. Treatment Even after all your preparation, sometimes life happens and your pool or spa can get away from you. In those moments, we need to start back from the beginning with testing of the water. Now that you have a clear idea of the current readings, your next steps will depend on the type of symptoms your water is presenting. This may include an issue such as algae (green, yellow, black, etc.), cloudiness, living organics, debris, and other water conditions.

Step 1 Measure your table. There is a simple calculation you can use to determine the measurements of your tablecloth. To start, you'll need to know the measurements of your table. For a rectangular or square-shaped table, use a measuring tape to measure your table's length and width. For a round table, you'll need to measure the diameter of your table. A diameter is the straight line going through the center of a circle. Step 2 Calculate the proper size for a square or rectangle table. If you have a rectangular table, you'll need to know your desired drop. Remember, this depends on the type of event you're planning. To start, add twice the desired drop to both the length and width of the table. For example, say your table is 48 inches wide and 72 inches long. You want a 6-inch drop. You would add 12 to 48, to get 60. You would then add 12 to 72, to get 84. The resulting values are the dimensions of the tablecloth you should aim to purchase. In our above example, you should look for a tablecloth that is 60 X 84 inches. Step 3 Figure out the size for a round table. Calculating the dimensions of a round table is somewhat simpler. To figure out your length, you simply add twice your desired drop by your table's diameter. Say you want a 5-inch drop and your table has a diameter of 50 inches. You would add 10 to 50, getting 60. When purchasing a tablecloth, select a 60-inch round tablecloth.

Coleman could see the light for the darkness. The young salesman was taking a stroll after a hard day\u2019s work selling typewriters, and spotted a new type of lamplight in a drugstore window in Brockton, Alabama. This new light burned with a strong, steady white flame and was fueled by gasoline. The standard lamp of the era burned kerosene and produced a smoky, flickering, yellowish light. W.C. was stricken with very poor eyesight, and was very interested in this new, steady white light that enabled him to read even the smallest print in books and on medicine bottles. Coleman saw potential in the new light, and through his vision a new company was born that would put America\u2019s farms and ranches in a new light, and would eventually make his name synonymous with outdoor fun.

Cal-Chlor Chlorine Granular is a strong pool shock treatment which is used to kill algae and bacteria as well as other harmful water contaminants. It is also a great shock to use for Spring pool openings. Use our Cal-Chlor Chlorine Granular to kill visible algae blooms and invisible bacteria, which could cause illness to swimmers. Your daily chlorination of the pool will kill most bacteria and other contaminants. To be sure that the water is completely sanitary, it is best to super chlorinate by shocking the pool every few weeks. Doing this also allows you to oxidize everything in the water, especially the various contaminants that may exist in the water. Clear, healthy water requires a powerful shock Powerful chlorine shock treatment that is great for regular maintenance Main active ingredient is 68% Calcium Hypochlorite (Cal-Hypo) for quick sanitizing Must pre-dissolve/dilute to prevent bleaching of vinyl liner surfaces Dosage: 1 Pound per 10,000 gallons Read more In The Swim's Recommended Pool Care Pool Care and Maintenance It is important to maintain your pool/spa to keep it clean and healthy all year round. Good habits, such as cleaning your filter or emptying your skimmer basket, will ensure that your investment is protected for years to come. But most importantly, you and your family will be able to enjoy the swimming pool or spa each season. Water Testing Testing the water weekly or bi-weekly, depending on use and outside variables, helps keep your pool/spa water healthy. Utilizing a DPD or OTO reagent-based water test kit, test strips, or digital testing will help you monitor the pool or spa water chemistry. Adjusting and Balancing Adjusting and balancing your pool or spa water chemistry ensures that you will get the most out of the swimming season. The benefit of having good pH and Alkalinity levels is that it will increase the ability of your main sanitizer to kill bacteria. Balanced pool water chemistry will also reduce chemical and maintenance costs. Balanced pH and alkalinity help prevent corrosion and scale formation on the interior pool surface and surrounding equipment. Read more Sanitizing There are many different types of sanitizers used in various pool and spa environments. Clean and healthy water starts by establishing a proper residual chlorine level with shock or concentrated granular chlorine. The most common way to maintain a proper chlorine level is by using trichlor chlorine tablets in either a floater or chemical feeder. Applying these steps to your normal maintenance plan will ensure the elimination of non-living organic contaminants, bacteria, micro organisms, and algae making your water safe to enjoy. Pool Fun and Safety Now that the water is properly balanced and sanitized, it\u2019s time to get in there and have some fun! We recommend enhancing your outdoor living environment with games, floats or loungers, toys, and accessories. Get creative! Safety is of the utmost importance, and there are many ways to help make your pool/spa safer. Having a life ring buoy, a shepherd's hook, depth markers, coast guard-approved life preservers, door and water alarms and having your local aquatic environment safety regulations on-hand will ensure a fun and safe environment for your family. Treatment Even after all your preparation, sometimes life happens and your pool or spa can get away from you. In those moments, we need to start back from the beginning with testing of the water. Now that you have a clear idea of the current readings, your next steps will depend on the type of symptoms your water is presenting. This may include an issue such as algae (green, yellow, black, etc.), cloudiness, living organics, debris, and other water conditions.

Step 1 Measure your table. There is a simple calculation you can use to determine the measurements of your tablecloth. To start, you'll need to know the measurements of your table. For a rectangular or square-shaped table, use a measuring tape to measure your table's length and width. For a round table, you'll need to measure the diameter of your table. A diameter is the straight line going through the center of a circle. Step 2 Calculate the proper size for a square or rectangle table. If you have a rectangular table, you'll need to know your desired drop. Remember, this depends on the type of event you're planning. To start, add twice the desired drop to both the length and width of the table. For example, say your table is 48 inches wide and 72 inches long. You want a 6-inch drop. You would add 12 to 48, to get 60. You would then add 12 to 72, to get 84. The resulting values are the dimensions of the tablecloth you should aim to purchase. In our above example, you should look for a tablecloth that is 60 X 84 inches. Step 3 Figure out the size for a round table. Calculating the dimensions of a round table is somewhat simpler. To figure out your length, you simply add twice your desired drop by your table's diameter. Say you want a 5-inch drop and your table has a diameter of 50 inches. You would add 10 to 50, getting 60. When purchasing a tablecloth, select a 60-inch round tablecloth.

Coleman could see the light for the darkness. The young salesman was taking a stroll after a hard day\u2019s work selling typewriters, and spotted a new type of lamplight in a drugstore window in Brockton, Alabama. This new light burned with a strong, steady white flame and was fueled by gasoline. The standard lamp of the era burned kerosene and produced a smoky, flickering, yellowish light. W.C. was stricken with very poor eyesight, and was very interested in this new, steady white light that enabled him to read even the smallest print in books and on medicine bottles. Coleman saw potential in the new light, and through his vision a new company was born that would put America\u2019s farms and ranches in a new light, and would eventually make his name synonymous with outdoor fun.

Cal-Chlor Chlorine Granular is a strong pool shock treatment which is used to kill algae and bacteria as well as other harmful water contaminants. It is also a great shock to use for Spring pool openings. Use our Cal-Chlor Chlorine Granular to kill visible algae blooms and invisible bacteria, which could cause illness to swimmers. Your daily chlorination of the pool will kill most bacteria and other contaminants. To be sure that the water is completely sanitary, it is best to super chlorinate by shocking the pool every few weeks. Doing this also allows you to oxidize everything in the water, especially the various contaminants that may exist in the water. Clear, healthy water requires a powerful shock Powerful chlorine shock treatment that is great for regular maintenance Main active ingredient is 68% Calcium Hypochlorite (Cal-Hypo) for quick sanitizing Must pre-dissolve/dilute to prevent bleaching of vinyl liner surfaces Dosage: 1 Pound per 10,000 gallons Read more In The Swim's Recommended Pool Care Pool Care and Maintenance It is important to maintain your pool/spa to keep it clean and healthy all year round. Good habits, such as cleaning your filter or emptying your skimmer basket, will ensure that your investment is protected for years to come. But most importantly, you and your family will be able to enjoy the swimming pool or spa each season. Water Testing Testing the water weekly or bi-weekly, depending on use and outside variables, helps keep your pool/spa water healthy. Utilizing a DPD or OTO reagent-based water test kit, test strips, or digital testing will help you monitor the pool or spa water chemistry. Adjusting and Balancing Adjusting and balancing your pool or spa water chemistry ensures that you will get the most out of the swimming season. The benefit of having good pH and Alkalinity levels is that it will increase the ability of your main sanitizer to kill bacteria. Balanced pool water chemistry will also reduce chemical and maintenance costs. Balanced pH and alkalinity help prevent corrosion and scale formation on the interior pool surface and surrounding equipment. Read more Sanitizing There are many different types of sanitizers used in various pool and spa environments. Clean and healthy water starts by establishing a proper residual chlorine level with shock or concentrated granular chlorine. The most common way to maintain a proper chlorine level is by using trichlor chlorine tablets in either a floater or chemical feeder. Applying these steps to your normal maintenance plan will ensure the elimination of non-living organic contaminants, bacteria, micro organisms, and algae making your water safe to enjoy. Pool Fun and Safety Now that the water is properly balanced and sanitized, it\u2019s time to get in there and have some fun! We recommend enhancing your outdoor living environment with games, floats or loungers, toys, and accessories. Get creative! Safety is of the utmost importance, and there are many ways to help make your pool/spa safer. Having a life ring buoy, a shepherd's hook, depth markers, coast guard-approved life preservers, door and water alarms and having your local aquatic environment safety regulations on-hand will ensure a fun and safe environment for your family. Treatment Even after all your preparation, sometimes life happens and your pool or spa can get away from you. In those moments, we need to start back from the beginning with testing of the water. Now that you have a clear idea of the current readings, your next steps will depend on the type of symptoms your water is presenting. This may include an issue such as algae (green, yellow, black, etc.), cloudiness, living organics, debris, and other water conditions.

Step 1 Measure your table. There is a simple calculation you can use to determine the measurements of your tablecloth. To start, you'll need to know the measurements of your table. For a rectangular or square-shaped table, use a measuring tape to measure your table's length and width. For a round table, you'll need to measure the diameter of your table. A diameter is the straight line going through the center of a circle. Step 2 Calculate the proper size for a square or rectangle table. If you have a rectangular table, you'll need to know your desired drop. Remember, this depends on the type of event you're planning. To start, add twice the desired drop to both the length and width of the table. For example, say your table is 48 inches wide and 72 inches long. You want a 6-inch drop. You would add 12 to 48, to get 60. You would then add 12 to 72, to get 84. The resulting values are the dimensions of the tablecloth you should aim to purchase. In our above example, you should look for a tablecloth that is 60 X 84 inches. Step 3 Figure out the size for a round table. Calculating the dimensions of a round table is somewhat simpler. To figure out your length, you simply add twice your desired drop by your table's diameter. Say you want a 5-inch drop and your table has a diameter of 50 inches. You would add 10 to 50, getting 60. When purchasing a tablecloth, select a 60-inch round tablecloth.
