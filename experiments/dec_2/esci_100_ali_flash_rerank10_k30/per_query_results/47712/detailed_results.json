Seeing a need for work pants that could hold up under rougher conditions, he and Jacob Davis, a tailor, created the first jean. In 1873, they received a U.S. patent for \"waist overalls\" with metal rivets at points of strain. The first product line designated by the lot number \"501\" was created in 1890. Today we design and market jeans, casual wear and related accessories for men, women, and children under the Levi's, Dockers, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen brands.

Today we design and market jeans, casual wear and related accessories for men, women, and children under the Levi's, Dockers, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen brands.

Seeing a need for work pants that could hold up under rougher conditions, he and Jacob Davis, a tailor, created the first jean. In 1873, they received a U.S. patent for \"waist overalls\" with metal rivets at points of strain. The first product line designated by the lot number \"501\" was created in 1890. Today we design and market jeans, casual wear and related accessories for men, women, and children under the Levi's, Dockers, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen brands.
