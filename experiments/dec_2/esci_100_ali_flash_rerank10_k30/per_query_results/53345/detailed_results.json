Generally, the battery continues to discharge even when it is not in use. This discharge consumes battery power and may damage the battery, thereby shorten its life. How to maintain the battery? The basic requirement for battery operation and maintenance is to keep the battery fully charged and not discharge. Our solar panels are designed for the daily maintenance of batteries, prevent damage to the 24 V rechargeable battery due to excessive natural loss after long-term storage. Note: Not a fast charger! How do solar chargers work? Solar panel is a panel made of crystalline silicon material, which can effectively absorb sunlight, convert it into electrical energy, and release a small current to charge and maintain the battery. The installation location, sunlight intensity and light time are the main factors affecting the solar panel power generation. The stronger the sunlight, the better the charging effect.

Our inventory is carefully controlled by strict quality assessments that must be met before qualifying for shipment. Our products undergo voltage tests, weight measurement, and psychology tests to make sure they are physically and mentally sound.

Generally, the battery continues to discharge even when it is not in use. This discharge consumes battery power and may damage the battery, thereby shorten its life. How to maintain the battery? The basic requirement for battery operation and maintenance is to keep the battery fully charged and not discharge. Our solar panels are designed for the daily maintenance of batteries, prevent damage to the 24 V rechargeable battery due to excessive natural loss after long-term storage. Note: Not a fast charger! How do solar chargers work? Solar panel is a panel made of crystalline silicon material, which can effectively absorb sunlight, convert it into electrical energy, and release a small current to charge and maintain the battery. The installation location, sunlight intensity and light time are the main factors affecting the solar panel power generation. The stronger the sunlight, the better the charging effect.

Me neither, but it's actually quite interesting. The first component of the battery is the ABS plastic shell. We then insert our very own lead plates and glass mat separators into the shell before filling with acid. The batteries are then capped, sealed, and charged to complete the process. Step 2 - Assess for Quality The next step in the process is that of quality control. We don't make great products by accident. Our inventory is carefully controlled by strict quality assessments that must be met before qualifying for shipment. Our products undergo voltage tests, weight measurement, and psychology tests to make sure they are physically and mentally sound. Step 3 - Pack with Care We've all gotten that package delivered in the mail that was clearly marked as 'fragile' but looked like it was used as a football by the delivery man. That's why all of our items are packaged with the customer in mind Step 4 - Deliver On Time, Every Time Your order is not completed until the item is in your hands. After all, what good is a great product if it doesn't get to you in time? When your alarm is screeching 'Fix Me, Fix Me!', you can trust that you won't have to wait an eternity for your battery to arrive.

Generally, the battery continues to discharge even when it is not in use. This discharge consumes battery power and may damage the battery, thereby shorten its life. How to maintain the battery? The basic requirement for battery operation and maintenance is to keep the battery fully charged and not discharge. Our solar panels are designed for the daily maintenance of batteries, prevent damage to the 24 V rechargeable battery due to excessive natural loss after long-term storage. Note: Not a fast charger! How do solar chargers work? Solar panel is a panel made of crystalline silicon material, which can effectively absorb sunlight, convert it into electrical energy, and release a small current to charge and maintain the battery. The installation location, sunlight intensity and light time are the main factors affecting the solar panel power generation. The stronger the sunlight, the better the charging effect.
