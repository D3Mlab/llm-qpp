Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder. A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men\u2019s (1919) and ladies\u2019 (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931).

Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder. A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men\u2019s (1919) and ladies\u2019 (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory \u2013 located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined \u201cto serve those who served us,\u201d Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world\u2019s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969). Today, as one of the world\u2019s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.

Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder. A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men\u2019s (1919) and ladies\u2019 (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory \u2013 located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined \u201cto serve those who served us,\u201d Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world\u2019s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969). Today, as one of the world\u2019s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.
