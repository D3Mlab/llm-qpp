Easily make your favorite cakes and multiple batches of cookie dough with the 5-quart stainless steel mixing bowl with comfortable handle. With 10 speeds, the standmixer will quickly become your kitchen\u2019s culinary center as you mix, knead and whip ingredients with ease. And for even more versatility, the power hub fits optional attachments from food grinders to pasta makers and more. Amazon.com KitchenAid's Artisan stand mixer is a substantial piece of equipment: 325 watts of mixing power make child's play of creaming butter, kneading dough, and whipping cream. The kid in you will appreciate how quick and easy it is to mix up a batch of cookie dough. This model comes with three attachments: a flat beater for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a wire whip for egg whites, mayonnaise, and more air-infused creations; and a hook for mixing and kneading yeast doughs. All three are solidly constructed and easily secured to the beater shaft with a simple twist. This model also includes a pouring shield for guiding ingredients to their proper destination, and the bowl itself locks tight to the base. Standing about 15 inches high, jutting out a foot, and weighing more than a grown woman's bowling ball, this stand mixer isn't the sort of appliance you'll wipe down and put away. Better to find a square foot of free counter space for easy access; besides, this machine is as pretty as it is rugged--you'll want to show it off. --Betsy Danheim From the Manufacturer The Artisan mixer's strong 325-watt motor delivers the power to handle the heaviest mixtures, and mix large batches easily. The 5-quart polished stainless steel bowl with ergonomic handle is big enough to handle large batches of heavy mixtures. Its ergonomically designed handle is contoured to fit the hand and makes lifting the bowl more comfortable. Unique Mixing Action The beater spins clockwise as the shaft spins counter clockwise; moving the beater to 67 different points around the bowl. This unique mixing action creates a thorough blend of ingredients and eliminates the need to rotate the bowl. Multiple Speeds 10 speeds allow the user to select the right speed for the mixing job; from very high to very slow stir. It's easy to select the precise speed needed for a perfect mix. Versatile Accessories The flat beater, dough hook, and the professional wire whip add to the versatility of the mixer. The flat beater is the ideal accessory for mixing normal to heavy batters. From cake mixes to firm cookie dough, the flat beater mixes quickly and thoroughly. The dough hook mixes and kneads yeast dough, saving both time and the effort of hand-kneading. The wire whip incorporates the maximum amount of air in whipped mixtures for fluffier whipped cream and angel food cakes. All attachments are solidly constructed, and attach easily to the stand mixer. Easy Clean Up The pouring shield fits around the top of the bowl and prevents ingredient splash-out. The chute makes it convenient and easy to add ingredients. The tilt-back mixer head allows for easy access to bowl and beaters. A lock lever holds the mixer head securely in place and the bowl fastens tightly to the base. Optional Attachments Optional attachments (sold separately) complete the package to make cooking a pleasure. From citrus juicer to sausage stuffer, KitchenAid stand mixers can handle just about any job in the kitchen.

Our 1.3 horsepower (HP) motor reference reflects the horsepower rating of the motor itself and not the mixer\u2019s horsepower output to the mixer bowl. This robust motor, the backbone of our new mixer, delivers .44 HP to the bowl enabling your mixer to deliver consistent power to small and large loads with less heat build-up; resulting in years of dependable mixing.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

Easily make your favorite cakes and multiple batches of cookie dough with the 5-quart stainless steel mixing bowl with comfortable handle. With 10 speeds, the standmixer will quickly become your kitchen\u2019s culinary center as you mix, knead and whip ingredients with ease. And for even more versatility, the power hub fits optional attachments from food grinders to pasta makers and more. Amazon.com KitchenAid's Artisan stand mixer is a substantial piece of equipment: 325 watts of mixing power make child's play of creaming butter, kneading dough, and whipping cream. The kid in you will appreciate how quick and easy it is to mix up a batch of cookie dough. This model comes with three attachments: a flat beater for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a wire whip for egg whites, mayonnaise, and more air-infused creations; and a hook for mixing and kneading yeast doughs. All three are solidly constructed and easily secured to the beater shaft with a simple twist. This model also includes a pouring shield for guiding ingredients to their proper destination, and the bowl itself locks tight to the base. Standing about 15 inches high, jutting out a foot, and weighing more than a grown woman's bowling ball, this stand mixer isn't the sort of appliance you'll wipe down and put away. Better to find a square foot of free counter space for easy access; besides, this machine is as pretty as it is rugged--you'll want to show it off. --Betsy Danheim From the Manufacturer The Artisan mixer's strong 325-watt motor delivers the power to handle the heaviest mixtures, and mix large batches easily. The 5-quart polished stainless steel bowl with ergonomic handle is big enough to handle large batches of heavy mixtures. Its ergonomically designed handle is contoured to fit the hand and makes lifting the bowl more comfortable. Unique Mixing Action The beater spins clockwise as the shaft spins counter clockwise; moving the beater to 67 different points around the bowl. This unique mixing action creates a thorough blend of ingredients and eliminates the need to rotate the bowl. Multiple Speeds 10 speeds allow the user to select the right speed for the mixing job; from very high to very slow stir. It's easy to select the precise speed needed for a perfect mix. Versatile Accessories The flat beater, dough hook, and the professional wire whip add to the versatility of the mixer. The flat beater is the ideal accessory for mixing normal to heavy batters. From cake mixes to firm cookie dough, the flat beater mixes quickly and thoroughly. The dough hook mixes and kneads yeast dough, saving both time and the effort of hand-kneading. The wire whip incorporates the maximum amount of air in whipped mixtures for fluffier whipped cream and angel food cakes. All attachments are solidly constructed, and attach easily to the stand mixer. Easy Clean Up The pouring shield fits around the top of the bowl and prevents ingredient splash-out. The chute makes it convenient and easy to add ingredients. The tilt-back mixer head allows for easy access to bowl and beaters. A lock lever holds the mixer head securely in place and the bowl fastens tightly to the base. Optional Attachments Optional attachments (sold separately) complete the package to make cooking a pleasure. From citrus juicer to sausage stuffer, KitchenAid stand mixers can handle just about any job in the kitchen.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

Easily make your favorite cakes and multiple batches of cookie dough with the 5-quart stainless steel mixing bowl with comfortable handle. With 10 speeds, the standmixer will quickly become your kitchen\u2019s culinary center as you mix, knead and whip ingredients with ease. And for even more versatility, the power hub fits optional attachments from food grinders to pasta makers and more. Amazon.com KitchenAid's Artisan stand mixer is a substantial piece of equipment: 325 watts of mixing power make child's play of creaming butter, kneading dough, and whipping cream. The kid in you will appreciate how quick and easy it is to mix up a batch of cookie dough. This model comes with three attachments: a flat beater for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a wire whip for egg whites, mayonnaise, and more air-infused creations; and a hook for mixing and kneading yeast doughs. All three are solidly constructed and easily secured to the beater shaft with a simple twist. This model also includes a pouring shield for guiding ingredients to their proper destination, and the bowl itself locks tight to the base. Standing about 15 inches high, jutting out a foot, and weighing more than a grown woman's bowling ball, this stand mixer isn't the sort of appliance you'll wipe down and put away. Better to find a square foot of free counter space for easy access; besides, this machine is as pretty as it is rugged--you'll want to show it off. --Betsy Danheim From the Manufacturer The Artisan mixer's strong 325-watt motor delivers the power to handle the heaviest mixtures, and mix large batches easily. The 5-quart polished stainless steel bowl with ergonomic handle is big enough to handle large batches of heavy mixtures. Its ergonomically designed handle is contoured to fit the hand and makes lifting the bowl more comfortable. Unique Mixing Action The beater spins clockwise as the shaft spins counter clockwise; moving the beater to 67 different points around the bowl. This unique mixing action creates a thorough blend of ingredients and eliminates the need to rotate the bowl. Multiple Speeds 10 speeds allow the user to select the right speed for the mixing job; from very high to very slow stir. It's easy to select the precise speed needed for a perfect mix. Versatile Accessories The flat beater, dough hook, and the professional wire whip add to the versatility of the mixer. The flat beater is the ideal accessory for mixing normal to heavy batters. From cake mixes to firm cookie dough, the flat beater mixes quickly and thoroughly. The dough hook mixes and kneads yeast dough, saving both time and the effort of hand-kneading. The wire whip incorporates the maximum amount of air in whipped mixtures for fluffier whipped cream and angel food cakes. All attachments are solidly constructed, and attach easily to the stand mixer. Easy Clean Up The pouring shield fits around the top of the bowl and prevents ingredient splash-out. The chute makes it convenient and easy to add ingredients. The tilt-back mixer head allows for easy access to bowl and beaters. A lock lever holds the mixer head securely in place and the bowl fastens tightly to the base. Optional Attachments Optional attachments (sold separately) complete the package to make cooking a pleasure. From citrus juicer to sausage stuffer, KitchenAid stand mixers can handle just about any job in the kitchen.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.
