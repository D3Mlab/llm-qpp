Read more Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Dial Taking apart a Hanayama Cast Puzzle is only half the challenge. Putting it back together again is the rest.

Designed by Vesa Timonen from Finland. Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Equa We have created a puzzle that takes on a spherical shape of an astronomical model composed of a planet and its surrounding ring. The planet positioned tightly inside the ring looks as if it cannot be taken out, and all you can do with it is rotate it on its axis. Or is this really the case? The theme of the puzzle is 'heaven' and was created by Oskar Deventer of The Netherlands. Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - H&H Just as the name suggests, this puzzle, shaped like the letter \u201cH,\u201d is made of two pieces entwined together. At a glance, the piece that make up the puzzle may appear to be of the exact same shape, but the pieces actually differ slightly. Do you think you can disassemble the two pieces?

The goal of this puzzle is to remove the helix ring that goes through that hole. The inspiration of this puzzle is the morning glory flower. The puzzle was designed to look like a bud that comes into bloom with twining tendrils. The original concept dates back to 1990, but it has been enhanced with the addition of several tricky features. The theme of this puzzle is \"flower.\" Dial Equa H&H Helix Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 Vortex \" The three pieces each have a spiral (vortex) body and two protrusions. When assembled together, each piece is unified into a flat object. In order to undo this complex entanglement it will be necessary to unbind them three dimensionally. The motivation behind this idea is the statue of Asura. Asura is an ancient Indian god and also a protector of Buddhism. The figure with the three faces and six arms conjured up the concept of Trinity. The subject is 'crest. '\" -Akio Yamamoto, 2008 Read more Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Labyrinth \" At the end of the 19th century, Britain experienced a huge puzzle craze. I managed to pick up a number of the puzzles famous during that period in flea markets, despite their rarity. Based on these original puzzles from Britain\u2019s famous puzzle period, this is one that we have successfully revived in its new form. The key point of this puzzle is decisively navigating its labyrinth, in which exists one point of weakness for you to break through. For the indecisive part of you. \" -Nob Yoshigahara, 1996 Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Padlock This is an evocative design of a sturdy padlock. Just pick it up and you\u2019ll quickly gain an appreciation for the challenge that lies ahead \u2013 this puzzle will not open easily! The interior is comprised of two elliptical pieces, locked together tightly around the circular pieces and obstinately refusing to be released. But don\u2019t give up!

Give it a go.\" Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Spiral \" At first glance, this puzzle by Kennet Walker of Rivermore, California doesn\u2019t seem un-lockable. The five pieces, however, can most certainly be taken apart. Putting them back together, however, is a whole new problem in itself. My suggestion for solving this puzzle would be to not apply too much pressure. Solve it or not, the five pieces exude a kind of elegance, spiraling into a comfortable fit in the palm of your hand.

Read more Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Dial Taking apart a Hanayama Cast Puzzle is only half the challenge. Putting it back together again is the rest. Solve the puzzle by turning the dials on both sides (front and back). The solution requires more than just moving forward. Sometimes moving a step back is also important. Designed by Vesa Timonen from Finland. Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Equa We have created a puzzle that takes on a spherical shape of an astronomical model composed of a planet and its surrounding ring. The planet positioned tightly inside the ring looks as if it cannot be taken out, and all you can do with it is rotate it on its axis. Or is this really the case? The theme of the puzzle is 'heaven' and was created by Oskar Deventer of The Netherlands. Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - H&H Just as the name suggests, this puzzle, shaped like the letter \u201cH,\u201d is made of two pieces entwined together. At a glance, the piece that make up the puzzle may appear to be of the exact same shape, but the pieces actually differ slightly. Do you think you can disassemble the two pieces? This movement of the pieces is very tricky, so you need to be careful that your memory doesn\u2019t play tricks on you too. Designed by Dutch genius Oskar Deventer. The theme is \u201centwine.\u201d Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Helix The grooves engraved in the two rotating boards are called \"logarithmic spirals.\" These two grooves always cross at right angles, and a square hole is formed at their intersection. The goal of this puzzle is to remove the helix ring that goes through that hole. The inspiration of this puzzle is the morning glory flower. The puzzle was designed to look like a bud that comes into bloom with twining tendrils. The original concept dates back to 1990, but it has been enhanced with the addition of several tricky features. The theme of this puzzle is \"flower.\" Dial Equa H&H Helix Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 Vortex \" The three pieces each have a spiral (vortex) body and two protrusions. When assembled together, each piece is unified into a flat object. In order to undo this complex entanglement it will be necessary to unbind them three dimensionally. The motivation behind this idea is the statue of Asura. Asura is an ancient Indian god and also a protector of Buddhism. The figure with the three faces and six arms conjured up the concept of Trinity. The subject is 'crest. '\" -Akio Yamamoto, 2008 Read more Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Labyrinth \" At the end of the 19th century, Britain experienced a huge puzzle craze. I managed to pick up a number of the puzzles famous during that period in flea markets, despite their rarity. Based on these original puzzles from Britain\u2019s famous puzzle period, this is one that we have successfully revived in its new form. The key point of this puzzle is decisively navigating its labyrinth, in which exists one point of weakness for you to break through. For the indecisive part of you. \" -Nob Yoshigahara, 1996 Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Padlock This is an evocative design of a sturdy padlock. Just pick it up and you\u2019ll quickly gain an appreciation for the challenge that lies ahead \u2013 this puzzle will not open easily! The interior is comprised of two elliptical pieces, locked together tightly around the circular pieces and obstinately refusing to be released. But don\u2019t give up! Repeatedly separate and then put them back together and prove you have what it takes to unlock this riddle. The theme is \u201cobstinacy.\u201d Designed by Korean designer JinHoo Ahn. Approximate size is 1-3/4\" x 1-1/4\" x 1\". Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Ring II \"This is the second of 'ring' puzzles. The five separate rings can be taken apart and put back together. This version has been changed a bit from the original made by Connecticut\u2019s Jose Grant. This puzzle has five rings, like the Olympic rings that stand the test of time. That is the basic concept behind this puzzle. This type of ring puzzle goes back at least as far as the 15th century, and is now remade with today\u2019s puzzle crafting knowledge. Give it a go.\" Hanayama Brain Teaser Puzzle Level 5 - Spiral \" At first glance, this puzzle by Kennet Walker of Rivermore, California doesn\u2019t seem un-lockable. The five pieces, however, can most certainly be taken apart. Putting them back together, however, is a whole new problem in itself. My suggestion for solving this puzzle would be to not apply too much pressure. Solve it or not, the five pieces exude a kind of elegance, spiraling into a comfortable fit in the palm of your hand.
