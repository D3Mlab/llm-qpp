How Long Will My YETI Soft Cooler Keep Ice? Due to a large number of variables that affect ice retention, YETI stays away from the definitive time claims that are often based on testing conditions and not real-life situations.

FEATURES DRYHIDE SHELL The Hopper\u2019s high-density fabric is waterproof and resistant to punctures, and UV rays. COLDCELL INSULATION Closed-cell rubber foam offers far superior cold-holding to ordinary soft coolers. HYDROLOK ZIPPER The toughest, highest-performing waterproof and leakproof cooler zipper in the world.

One that was built for the serious outdoor enthusiast rather than for the mass-discount retailers. One that simply wouldn\u2019t break. Today, YETI products perform when it matters most - whether that be an excursion into the Alaskan wilderness, chasing redfish on the Gulf coast, or just getting together with friends in the backyard. The YETI Crossroads Collection Visit the Store YETI Drinkware Best sellers Visit the Store YETI Cooler Best Sellers Visit the Store YETI Bottle Best Sellers Visit the Store YETI Gear Best Sellers Visit the Store YETI Pet Gear Visit the Store Next page Product Description SOFT COOLERS YETI Soft Coolers stand apart for their ridiculously rugged materials and their superior thermal performance. Built for extreme conditions and tough enough to accompany you on treks through the brush, rocky shoreline post-ups, and lunch on the ranch, you\u2019ll find what you need for your next day out in our lineup of anything-but-soft coolers. How Long Will My YETI Soft Cooler Keep Ice? Due to a large number of variables that affect ice retention, YETI stays away from the definitive time claims that are often based on testing conditions and not real-life situations. However, the Hopper Family of soft coolers\u2014with cold-holding features like a welded DryHide Shell, thick ColdCell Insulation, and a waterproof HydroLok Zipper\u2014provide unmatched ice-retention power. FEATURES DRYHIDE SHELL The Hopper\u2019s high-density fabric is waterproof and resistant to punctures, and UV rays. COLDCELL INSULATION Closed-cell rubber foam offers far superior cold-holding to ordinary soft coolers. HYDROLOK ZIPPER The toughest, highest-performing waterproof and leakproof cooler zipper in the world. HITCHPOINT GRID Easily attach pretty much anything, including the MOLLE Zinger, MOLLE Bottle Opener and SideKick.

Next page Product Description The Best For Meal Prep Part of successful meal prep is having a grown-up carrier that\u2019s multi-functional and built to travel. ThinkFit\u2019s bags are specifically designed for meal prep so you can let go of your kids lunch box and retire the old plastic grocery bags you\u2019ve been making due with. You and your meals deserve this upgrade. Perfect For Work ThinkFit\u2019s bag design bridges the gap between home and work. It has everything needed to get your meals safely into the office without spilling or spoiling your car, clothes, or work materials during the commute and the bag doubles as a cooler if your office or work-site lacks a fridge. Great for long shifts and travel. At The Gym Making it to the gym as a part of your wellness routine? Our meal prep system comes with a unique shaker cup, supplement dispensers, and extra pockets to hold your keys, phone, wallet, and anything else you might need while you are at the gym. We keep it in reach so you can keep reaching for those gains. Read more 2 XL Ice Packs With our heavy-duty XL ice packs, 2 included with each bag , you can keep your prepped meals at a safe temperature for us to 12 hours in a temperate environment; an essential feature for those that are in the car all day, out at a work site, or just trying to avoid the horror that is a shared office fridge. 6 BPA Free Containers We\u2019ve taken the guesswork out of portion control for you, each bag comes standard with two 1.5 cup capacity containers and four 2.5 cup capacity containers. In addition, ThinkFit's BPA Free Containers are microwave, freezer, dishwasher safe and come standard with snap lock lids and silicone seals to maintain freshness and reduce spoilage. 23oz Innovative Shaker Cup The BPA free shaker bottle has 3 storage containers that screw onto the bottom of the bottle.
