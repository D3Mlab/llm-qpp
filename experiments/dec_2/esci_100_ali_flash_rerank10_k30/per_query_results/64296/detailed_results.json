Please always consult your stylist before attempting any styling techniques you are unsure. Q3:Why the hair has grey hair? A:As remy hair, it is very normal for virgin hair to have gray hairs,especially since our virgin hair is not altered.Remy hair is cut from young and healthy donor, so you can expect any natural affects such as gray hairs,some split ends,and different curl patterns in one bundle.

Please always consult your stylist before attempting any styling techniques you are unsure. Q3:Why the hair has grey hair? A:As remy hair, it is very normal for virgin hair to have gray hairs,especially since our virgin hair is not altered.Remy hair is cut from young and healthy donor, so you can expect any natural affects such as gray hairs,some split ends,and different curl patterns in one bundle.
