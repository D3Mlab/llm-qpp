Soap Making Visit the Store Candle Making Visit the Store Next page Product Description Box contents: 16 jars with wax dyes Total net weight: 3.2 oz Dyes melting temperature: 167-185 \u00b0F (75-85\u00b0C). Please always take into account the maximum heating temperature recommended for your wax. Dosage: 0.03-0.06 oz of dyes per 1 lb of wax We offer high-quality candle making dyes, suitable for organic waxes and paraffin. The only type of wax they are not compatible with is gel wax. You can mix up the dyes creating a variety of colors and shades according to your ideas and preferences. For your convenience, we have already crushed the wax dyes into flakes to be conveniently and more easily incorporated into a candle mass. It may take some time and patience to fully blend the dyes with the wax (up to 5 minutes of continuous stirring at a stable temperature), but there won\u2019t be any clots and the coloring will be even. In addition. The finished candle keeps its color brightness and does not tarnish with time. Step 1 - Adding Melt your wax / paraffin at the recommended temperature and add the dye. You need to determine the optimal temperature both for your wax /paraffin (not to overheat it) and the dye (to let it start melting). Step 2 - Blending Make sure you stir the wax / paraffin with the dye at a stable temperature for at least 3-5 minutes to let the dye fully melt and color the candle wax. The recommended temperature for dye melting is 167-185 \u00b0F (75-85\u00b0C). Step 3 - Pouring Prepare the mold for your future candle. Always take into account the recommended temperature for your mold, as a too hot temperature may distort a plastic mold, for example. Lubricate the mold with silicone for easier release and pour the liquid colored wax / paraffin into it. Step 4 - Releasing Some waxes may form a sinkhole on the candle surface as the candle is cooling and hardening. In this case you should perform additional pouring to fill the sinkhole. As soon as the candle has fully solidified, you can take it out of the mold. Read more Read more Wonder how to spend your free time? Make a candle! Or two, or even more - for family and friends.

Soap Making Visit the Store Candle Making Visit the Store Next page Product Description Box contents: 16 jars with wax dyes Total net weight: 3.2 oz Dyes melting temperature: 167-185 \u00b0F (75-85\u00b0C). Please always take into account the maximum heating temperature recommended for your wax. Dosage: 0.03-0.06 oz of dyes per 1 lb of wax We offer high-quality candle making dyes, suitable for organic waxes and paraffin. The only type of wax they are not compatible with is gel wax. You can mix up the dyes creating a variety of colors and shades according to your ideas and preferences. For your convenience, we have already crushed the wax dyes into flakes to be conveniently and more easily incorporated into a candle mass. It may take some time and patience to fully blend the dyes with the wax (up to 5 minutes of continuous stirring at a stable temperature), but there won\u2019t be any clots and the coloring will be even. In addition. The finished candle keeps its color brightness and does not tarnish with time. Step 1 - Adding Melt your wax / paraffin at the recommended temperature and add the dye. You need to determine the optimal temperature both for your wax /paraffin (not to overheat it) and the dye (to let it start melting). Step 2 - Blending Make sure you stir the wax / paraffin with the dye at a stable temperature for at least 3-5 minutes to let the dye fully melt and color the candle wax. The recommended temperature for dye melting is 167-185 \u00b0F (75-85\u00b0C). Step 3 - Pouring Prepare the mold for your future candle. Always take into account the recommended temperature for your mold, as a too hot temperature may distort a plastic mold, for example. Lubricate the mold with silicone for easier release and pour the liquid colored wax / paraffin into it. Step 4 - Releasing Some waxes may form a sinkhole on the candle surface as the candle is cooling and hardening. In this case you should perform additional pouring to fill the sinkhole. As soon as the candle has fully solidified, you can take it out of the mold. Read more Read more Wonder how to spend your free time? Make a candle! Or two, or even more - for family and friends.

Soap Making Visit the Store Candle Making Visit the Store Next page Product Description Box contents: 16 jars with wax dyes Total net weight: 3.2 oz Dyes melting temperature: 167-185 \u00b0F (75-85\u00b0C). Please always take into account the maximum heating temperature recommended for your wax. Dosage: 0.03-0.06 oz of dyes per 1 lb of wax We offer high-quality candle making dyes, suitable for organic waxes and paraffin. The only type of wax they are not compatible with is gel wax. You can mix up the dyes creating a variety of colors and shades according to your ideas and preferences. For your convenience, we have already crushed the wax dyes into flakes to be conveniently and more easily incorporated into a candle mass. It may take some time and patience to fully blend the dyes with the wax (up to 5 minutes of continuous stirring at a stable temperature), but there won\u2019t be any clots and the coloring will be even. In addition. The finished candle keeps its color brightness and does not tarnish with time. Step 1 - Adding Melt your wax / paraffin at the recommended temperature and add the dye. You need to determine the optimal temperature both for your wax /paraffin (not to overheat it) and the dye (to let it start melting). Step 2 - Blending Make sure you stir the wax / paraffin with the dye at a stable temperature for at least 3-5 minutes to let the dye fully melt and color the candle wax. The recommended temperature for dye melting is 167-185 \u00b0F (75-85\u00b0C). Step 3 - Pouring Prepare the mold for your future candle. Always take into account the recommended temperature for your mold, as a too hot temperature may distort a plastic mold, for example. Lubricate the mold with silicone for easier release and pour the liquid colored wax / paraffin into it. Step 4 - Releasing Some waxes may form a sinkhole on the candle surface as the candle is cooling and hardening. In this case you should perform additional pouring to fill the sinkhole. As soon as the candle has fully solidified, you can take it out of the mold. Read more Read more Wonder how to spend your free time? Make a candle! Or two, or even more - for family and friends.
