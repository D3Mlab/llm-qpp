Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Lean it against the wall or floor for maximum trigger point relief. This stainless steel KOA ELITE works beautifully to release the knots in smaller, hard to pinpoint areas that require fingers, not elbows or palms - between your shoulder blades, shoulders, neck and face. Especially beloved for its ability to help you reach knotted fascia in your inner thighs, neck and arms. This hand-held sonic facial helps release wrinkle causing tension, and is the easiest, best way to nourish & rejuvenate your skin inside & out. Supports Advanced Massage Techniques Neuromuscular Self Massage DOES IT HURT? YES , releasing muscle knots and tension WILL hurt! Usually tension, stress or overexertion that accumulate from daily life turns into painful tight, bound up muscle knots.These knots can cause pain in areas surrounding them. The pain then radiates through that point causing discomfort in more than one area of the body. Trigger points form due to inadequate or restricted blood flow and oxygen. Make sure to ease into it slowly and gently as tolerable. When you find the trigger points, press deeply on it and hold the sustained pressure. The discomfort and pain that the trigger point was causing you will become intense. In order to release trigger points, there must be enough pressure applied for some time (several seconds to minutes or however long you can handle it). It DOES HURT, but the pain will dissipate and lessen after pressure has been applied to the trigger point for some time. Deep Tissue Myofascial Release WILL THIS CAUSE BRUISING? Much like a deep tissue massage, any firm pressure against the skin can cause bruising and soreness, and is quite common as the tissue adjusts. Remember, bruising is simply increased blood circulation to that area, and you\u2019re welcome to work your way up to the deepest pressure based on your comfort level. As with any health aid, consulting with your health professional, along with referring them to our website, is often the best course of action if you face health changes or concerns. Are Fascia and Cellulite the same thing? Fascia is a connective tissue. Cellulite appears atop fascia as subcutaneous layers of fat across your buttocks, hips and thighs. That\u2019s why treating both at once is so effective! Trigger Point Therapy How hard should I use KOA ELITE? This is why we prefer KOA ELITE over a massage therapist for daily aches and cellulite. Because you maintain full control, you decide if light and steady or deep penetration works best for you. How Quickly Will I See Results? Individual results will vary. You may feel the KOA Massage working right away to decompress and \u201cdetangle\u201d tense tissue, or it may take longer depending on severity of issue. Most people feel a difference in their aches and pains after just a few minutes of use. Everyone\u2019s body and pain management needs are as unique as they are. With consistent use, you can expect to experience increasing benefits of healthy, happy myofascial tissues, blood flow, nerves, joints, and skin.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Lean it against the wall or floor for maximum trigger point relief. This stainless steel KOA ELITE works beautifully to release the knots in smaller, hard to pinpoint areas that require fingers, not elbows or palms - between your shoulder blades, shoulders, neck and face. Especially beloved for its ability to help you reach knotted fascia in your inner thighs, neck and arms. This hand-held sonic facial helps release wrinkle causing tension, and is the easiest, best way to nourish & rejuvenate your skin inside & out. Supports Advanced Massage Techniques Neuromuscular Self Massage DOES IT HURT? YES , releasing muscle knots and tension WILL hurt! Usually tension, stress or overexertion that accumulate from daily life turns into painful tight, bound up muscle knots.These knots can cause pain in areas surrounding them. The pain then radiates through that point causing discomfort in more than one area of the body. Trigger points form due to inadequate or restricted blood flow and oxygen. Make sure to ease into it slowly and gently as tolerable. When you find the trigger points, press deeply on it and hold the sustained pressure. The discomfort and pain that the trigger point was causing you will become intense. In order to release trigger points, there must be enough pressure applied for some time (several seconds to minutes or however long you can handle it). It DOES HURT, but the pain will dissipate and lessen after pressure has been applied to the trigger point for some time. Deep Tissue Myofascial Release WILL THIS CAUSE BRUISING? Much like a deep tissue massage, any firm pressure against the skin can cause bruising and soreness, and is quite common as the tissue adjusts. Remember, bruising is simply increased blood circulation to that area, and you\u2019re welcome to work your way up to the deepest pressure based on your comfort level. As with any health aid, consulting with your health professional, along with referring them to our website, is often the best course of action if you face health changes or concerns. Are Fascia and Cellulite the same thing? Fascia is a connective tissue. Cellulite appears atop fascia as subcutaneous layers of fat across your buttocks, hips and thighs. That\u2019s why treating both at once is so effective! Trigger Point Therapy How hard should I use KOA ELITE? This is why we prefer KOA ELITE over a massage therapist for daily aches and cellulite. Because you maintain full control, you decide if light and steady or deep penetration works best for you. How Quickly Will I See Results? Individual results will vary. You may feel the KOA Massage working right away to decompress and \u201cdetangle\u201d tense tissue, or it may take longer depending on severity of issue. Most people feel a difference in their aches and pains after just a few minutes of use. Everyone\u2019s body and pain management needs are as unique as they are. With consistent use, you can expect to experience increasing benefits of healthy, happy myofascial tissues, blood flow, nerves, joints, and skin.

Together with my childhood friend, Johnny, in 2015 we set up this small family business called InvoSpa, focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Our history dates back to when I had a job with an IT company, requiring me to sit at my desk for hours on end. I started feeling discomfort, fatigue, and pain, due to sedentary behavior: stiff neck, sore back, pain in my joints, swollen legs and feet, and so on. I barely had time to give my body any attention. It all came to a head one day at a family celebration when I realized I was hardly enjoying being there with my loved ones because of the pain I was experiencing. That's when I decided to see a specialist. The human body can\u2019t spend hours in a row without resting, as prolonged sitting or standing in the same position poses numerous health risks. It starts with accelerating tiredness and fatigue, then increases the risk of developing arthritis problems and MSDs due to stress on the bones, joints, and tendons, as explained to me by the specialist. I realized the amount of stress our bodies are subjected to in daily life. Hiring a massage therapist wasn't an option without breaking the bank, and while the massagers on the market were good, we needed something superior: easy-to-carry, sturdy, with different levels and degrees for our different bodies, and (most importantly) one that we could use anywhere (at home, at the office, or in the car). That\u2019s how InvoSpa was born, to cover all the blank spots and features missing on the market. Since then, we have formed a team of professionals devoting themselves on a daily basis to providing practical solutions for people like you and me. So we thank you for choosing InvoSpa, and joining in on our vision for a healthy lifestyle with an improved quality of life! All you have to do now is sit back, relax, and JUST ENJOY.

Lean it against the wall or floor for maximum trigger point relief. This stainless steel KOA ELITE works beautifully to release the knots in smaller, hard to pinpoint areas that require fingers, not elbows or palms - between your shoulder blades, shoulders, neck and face. Especially beloved for its ability to help you reach knotted fascia in your inner thighs, neck and arms. This hand-held sonic facial helps release wrinkle causing tension, and is the easiest, best way to nourish & rejuvenate your skin inside & out. Supports Advanced Massage Techniques Neuromuscular Self Massage DOES IT HURT? YES , releasing muscle knots and tension WILL hurt! Usually tension, stress or overexertion that accumulate from daily life turns into painful tight, bound up muscle knots.These knots can cause pain in areas surrounding them. The pain then radiates through that point causing discomfort in more than one area of the body. Trigger points form due to inadequate or restricted blood flow and oxygen. Make sure to ease into it slowly and gently as tolerable. When you find the trigger points, press deeply on it and hold the sustained pressure. The discomfort and pain that the trigger point was causing you will become intense. In order to release trigger points, there must be enough pressure applied for some time (several seconds to minutes or however long you can handle it). It DOES HURT, but the pain will dissipate and lessen after pressure has been applied to the trigger point for some time. Deep Tissue Myofascial Release WILL THIS CAUSE BRUISING? Much like a deep tissue massage, any firm pressure against the skin can cause bruising and soreness, and is quite common as the tissue adjusts. Remember, bruising is simply increased blood circulation to that area, and you\u2019re welcome to work your way up to the deepest pressure based on your comfort level. As with any health aid, consulting with your health professional, along with referring them to our website, is often the best course of action if you face health changes or concerns. Are Fascia and Cellulite the same thing? Fascia is a connective tissue. Cellulite appears atop fascia as subcutaneous layers of fat across your buttocks, hips and thighs. That\u2019s why treating both at once is so effective! Trigger Point Therapy How hard should I use KOA ELITE? This is why we prefer KOA ELITE over a massage therapist for daily aches and cellulite. Because you maintain full control, you decide if light and steady or deep penetration works best for you. How Quickly Will I See Results? Individual results will vary. You may feel the KOA Massage working right away to decompress and \u201cdetangle\u201d tense tissue, or it may take longer depending on severity of issue. Most people feel a difference in their aches and pains after just a few minutes of use. Everyone\u2019s body and pain management needs are as unique as they are. With consistent use, you can expect to experience increasing benefits of healthy, happy myofascial tissues, blood flow, nerves, joints, and skin.
