When our first wound healing technology was found to scarlessly heal burned skin, while making it appear more youthful, NEOCUTIS scientists began to explore how to apply the same principles to improve the appearance of aging skin. Unlike young skin, which heals quickly and easily, older skin acts more like wounded skin. Read more NEOCUTIS began developing products that support natural healing by stimulating the processes that regenerate and restore the key building blocks of skin structure\u2014namely, collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. Since then, our ongoing cutting-edge research and meticulous craftsmanship with only the best cosmetic ingredients have led to the development of products that deliver targeted peptides and proteins to help nourish and rejuvenate skin.\n\n171975: philosophy Ultimate Miracle Worker Multi-rejuvenating moisturizer SPF 30 With retinol & glycolic acid, 2 oz\tFrom the manufacturer KEY INGREDIENTS formulated with retinol, glycolic acid, full spectrum spf protection Previous page CLEANSE gently apply a quarter-size amount of the purity facial cleanser onto a lightly damp face, and massage for 30-60 seconds. rinse and pat dry.
