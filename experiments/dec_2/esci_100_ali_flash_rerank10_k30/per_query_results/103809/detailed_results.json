Mega Accessory Set With a grand total of 45 pieces, this accessory set has everything your little builder will need, including both hand and power tools, hardware, painting supplies, and more! Read more Why Play with a Pretend Workshop? Language + Social Skills Role playing requires kids to engage in story telling as they make up scenarios, and communicate with others what role they are playing. Any new toy also expands a child\u2019s vocabulary \u2013 learning words like \u201cworkshop\u201d and \u201cdrill\u201d. Physical + Motor Skills Pretend play is great for motor skill development as kids use small accessories just like adult role models do. Gripping a drill bit, fitting pieces together, and using the spring-action vise all develop hand-eye coordination and physical dexterity. Critical Thinking Running into problems while playing, like an item that won\u2019t fit into the storage bin or missing a screw for a project allows kids to think through problems and craft solutions on their own. Creativity + Role Play When kids pretend play, they engage in storytelling, which allows them to exercise their brain and train it to think creatively. They will learn to think for themselves and make decisions that impact the story they create. Read more Play Together! Builder\u2019s Network: Give your child 10 minutes to prepare for their own pretend TV show! Record them on a camera or other smart device, and watch as they build their creation and talk through the steps in 10 minutes or less. Continue to make \u201cepisodes\u201d of your TV show to share with family and friends! Tool Time: Inspire creative play with your little builder by sharing the tools to build new things! Engage your child by asking thoughtful questions: \u201cWhat is the name for your creation?\u201d, \u201cWhat does it do?\u201d, \u201cHow do you use it?\u201d. Make sharing the clean-up responsibilities fun with your little one. Count the screws, wood pieces, and tools to make sure nothing gets lost as each piece is safely put away in the storage areas. Clean-up when playtime is over helps to foster good habits, shows an example of teamwork, and includes a bonus in motor skill development!\n\n567466: Kids Little Boys Girls Baby Long Sleeve Button Down Red Plaid Flannel Shirt Plaid Girl Boy 1T-6T\tFrom the brand CM C&M WODRO Designed to provide premium and comfortable kids clothing.

Mega Accessory Set With a grand total of 45 pieces, this accessory set has everything your little builder will need, including both hand and power tools, hardware, painting supplies, and more! Read more Why Play with a Pretend Workshop? Language + Social Skills Role playing requires kids to engage in story telling as they make up scenarios, and communicate with others what role they are playing. Any new toy also expands a child\u2019s vocabulary \u2013 learning words like \u201cworkshop\u201d and \u201cdrill\u201d. Physical + Motor Skills Pretend play is great for motor skill development as kids use small accessories just like adult role models do. Gripping a drill bit, fitting pieces together, and using the spring-action vise all develop hand-eye coordination and physical dexterity. Critical Thinking Running into problems while playing, like an item that won\u2019t fit into the storage bin or missing a screw for a project allows kids to think through problems and craft solutions on their own. Creativity + Role Play When kids pretend play, they engage in storytelling, which allows them to exercise their brain and train it to think creatively. They will learn to think for themselves and make decisions that impact the story they create. Read more Play Together! Builder\u2019s Network: Give your child 10 minutes to prepare for their own pretend TV show! Record them on a camera or other smart device, and watch as they build their creation and talk through the steps in 10 minutes or less. Continue to make \u201cepisodes\u201d of your TV show to share with family and friends! Tool Time: Inspire creative play with your little builder by sharing the tools to build new things! Engage your child by asking thoughtful questions: \u201cWhat is the name for your creation?\u201d, \u201cWhat does it do?\u201d, \u201cHow do you use it?\u201d. Make sharing the clean-up responsibilities fun with your little one. Count the screws, wood pieces, and tools to make sure nothing gets lost as each piece is safely put away in the storage areas. Clean-up when playtime is over helps to foster good habits, shows an example of teamwork, and includes a bonus in motor skill development!\n\n567466: Kids Little Boys Girls Baby Long Sleeve Button Down Red Plaid Flannel Shirt Plaid Girl Boy 1T-6T\tFrom the brand CM C&M WODRO Designed to provide premium and comfortable kids clothing.

Mega Accessory Set With a grand total of 45 pieces, this accessory set has everything your little builder will need, including both hand and power tools, hardware, painting supplies, and more! Read more Why Play with a Pretend Workshop? Language + Social Skills Role playing requires kids to engage in story telling as they make up scenarios, and communicate with others what role they are playing. Any new toy also expands a child\u2019s vocabulary \u2013 learning words like \u201cworkshop\u201d and \u201cdrill\u201d. Physical + Motor Skills Pretend play is great for motor skill development as kids use small accessories just like adult role models do. Gripping a drill bit, fitting pieces together, and using the spring-action vise all develop hand-eye coordination and physical dexterity. Critical Thinking Running into problems while playing, like an item that won\u2019t fit into the storage bin or missing a screw for a project allows kids to think through problems and craft solutions on their own. Creativity + Role Play When kids pretend play, they engage in storytelling, which allows them to exercise their brain and train it to think creatively. They will learn to think for themselves and make decisions that impact the story they create. Read more Play Together! Builder\u2019s Network: Give your child 10 minutes to prepare for their own pretend TV show! Record them on a camera or other smart device, and watch as they build their creation and talk through the steps in 10 minutes or less. Continue to make \u201cepisodes\u201d of your TV show to share with family and friends! Tool Time: Inspire creative play with your little builder by sharing the tools to build new things! Engage your child by asking thoughtful questions: \u201cWhat is the name for your creation?\u201d, \u201cWhat does it do?\u201d, \u201cHow do you use it?\u201d. Make sharing the clean-up responsibilities fun with your little one. Count the screws, wood pieces, and tools to make sure nothing gets lost as each piece is safely put away in the storage areas. Clean-up when playtime is over helps to foster good habits, shows an example of teamwork, and includes a bonus in motor skill development!\n\n567466: Kids Little Boys Girls Baby Long Sleeve Button Down Red Plaid Flannel Shirt Plaid Girl Boy 1T-6T\tFrom the brand CM C&M WODRO Designed to provide premium and comfortable kids clothing.
