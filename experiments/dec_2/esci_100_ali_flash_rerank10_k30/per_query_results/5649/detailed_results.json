We designed the new MacBook to be not only thinner and lighter, but more functional and intuitive than ever before. To do that, we couldn't just shave a millimeter here, a gram there. So we started from scratch, reinventing each essential element as part of a singular, deceptively simple design. It's everything there is to love about Mac. In its purest form ever. A keyboard reimagined from A to Z. From the beginning, our goal was to design a full, uncompromising Mac experience. And a full-size keyboard is an essential part of that. In order to fit a full-size keyboard in the incredibly thin MacBook, we designed the keyboard from the ground up. Each component has been rethought specifically for the new MacBook, from the underlying mechanism to the curvature of the surface of each key to the distinctive new typeface. The result is a keyboard dramatically thinner than its predecessor. Now when your finger strikes the key, it goes down and bounces back with a crisp, consistent motion that makes typing with precision a breeze. Butterfly mechanism. Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers. So we designed an entirely new butterfly mechanism. Product Description Pure invention.

We designed the new MacBook to be not only thinner and lighter, but more functional and intuitive than ever before. To do that, we couldn't just shave a millimeter here, a gram there. So we started from scratch, reinventing each essential element as part of a singular, deceptively simple design. It's everything there is to love about Mac. In its purest form ever. A keyboard reimagined from A to Z. From the beginning, our goal was to design a full, uncompromising Mac experience. And a full-size keyboard is an essential part of that. In order to fit a full-size keyboard in the incredibly thin MacBook, we designed the keyboard from the ground up. Each component has been rethought specifically for the new MacBook, from the underlying mechanism to the curvature of the surface of each key to the distinctive new typeface. The result is a keyboard dramatically thinner than its predecessor. Now when your finger strikes the key, it goes down and bounces back with a crisp, consistent motion that makes typing with precision a breeze. Butterfly mechanism. Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers. So we designed an entirely new butterfly mechanism. Product Description Pure invention.

Read more ASUS SuperBattery Technology VivoBook Flip 14 J401 lasts all day* on a full charge, so there's no need to look for power outlets. But when it's time to plug in, ASUS SuperBattery technology helps protect your battery and provides up to 3X longer battery life versus standard lithium-ion cylinder battery configurations. With ASUS SuperBattery, the high-quality battery is complemented by the new ASUS Battery Health Charging technology which allows you to set the State of Charge to 60%, 80% or 100% to prevent overcharging. Overcharging a laptop may degrade the battery, result in a shorter lifespan, or cause the battery to swell due to oxidation. *Battery life may vary depending on usage type and environmental conditions. Actual battery life may be significantly less than benchmark testing. Battery life decreases over time. For Unlimited Possibilities VivoBook Flip 14 J401 includes a USB 3.1 port with a reversible USB Type-C (USB-C) connector for superfast data transfer speeds and to make connecting devices easy and quick.

The specially-designed hinge features precision-engineered alloy-steel gears that mesh perfectly for smooth rotation while also making the hinge tough and reliable. To prove the durability of this unique design, ASUS engineers put it through a punishing 20,000-cycle open-and-close test. Think it, Write it! VivoBook Flip 14 J401 is designed for the ultimate touch experience, and detects the subtlest movements of your fingertips. Its high-precision touch sensors are spaced at 6mm intervals \u2013 this ensures greater sensitivity over displays with the industry standard 9mm spacing between sensors.

We designed the new MacBook to be not only thinner and lighter, but more functional and intuitive than ever before. To do that, we couldn't just shave a millimeter here, a gram there. So we started from scratch, reinventing each essential element as part of a singular, deceptively simple design. It's everything there is to love about Mac. In its purest form ever. A keyboard reimagined from A to Z. From the beginning, our goal was to design a full, uncompromising Mac experience. And a full-size keyboard is an essential part of that. In order to fit a full-size keyboard in the incredibly thin MacBook, we designed the keyboard from the ground up. Each component has been rethought specifically for the new MacBook, from the underlying mechanism to the curvature of the surface of each key to the distinctive new typeface. The result is a keyboard dramatically thinner than its predecessor. Now when your finger strikes the key, it goes down and bounces back with a crisp, consistent motion that makes typing with precision a breeze. Butterfly mechanism. Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers. So we designed an entirely new butterfly mechanism. Product Description Pure invention.
