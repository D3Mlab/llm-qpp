In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors. See more Product Description Product Description We see a future built on great brands, great products, and great people. In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual.

As the market for automotive refurbishing began to take off in the 1970s, Curt realized that proper tools and techniques could save enthusiasts like him time and money. So in the fall of 1978, Curt launched a business to better serve the burgeoning market of auto restoration and customization hobbyists, and he called it Eastwood. Since its inception, Eastwood recognizes that change constantly takes place in the marketplace, and so strives to stay abreast of these developments by placing customers' wants and needs at the forefront. In recent years, the market for automotive hobbyists has expanded beyond the \"classics\", and Eastwood has seen increased requests for products geared towards muscle cars, street rods, trucks, and motorcycles. The explosion of the sport tuner hobby has demanded products that emphasize ease-of-use and variety, as customizers strive to make their vehicles truly unique. In response, the company has continued to be an industry pioneer, adding innovative, high-quality products to its line.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

As the market for automotive refurbishing began to take off in the 1970s, Curt realized that proper tools and techniques could save enthusiasts like him time and money. So in the fall of 1978, Curt launched a business to better serve the burgeoning market of auto restoration and customization hobbyists, and he called it Eastwood. Since its inception, Eastwood recognizes that change constantly takes place in the marketplace, and so strives to stay abreast of these developments by placing customers' wants and needs at the forefront. In recent years, the market for automotive hobbyists has expanded beyond the \"classics\", and Eastwood has seen increased requests for products geared towards muscle cars, street rods, trucks, and motorcycles. The explosion of the sport tuner hobby has demanded products that emphasize ease-of-use and variety, as customizers strive to make their vehicles truly unique.

In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three. Amazon.com The result of years of planning and design, the 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt Powermatic 1280100C PM2700 shaper has been built from the ground up to be the last shaper you'll ever need. Offering more features than any other shaper in its class, it provides an extra-large cast-iron table and heavy-duty miter gauge with aluminum extruded support to tackle any job with ease. Power, Accuracy, and Durability Bringing an industry-leading package of features to your shop, the PM2700 has Powermatic's legendary durability and precision. It boasts a fully welded base cabinet built from heavy-gauge steel and includes a dust collection chute that terminates in a four-inch-diameter port at the rear. There's both a door and window for easy monitoring of, and access to, the belt and spindle lock, and a micro-switch to prevent the motor from starting unless the door is securely closed. Robust Five-Horsepower Motor The PM2700 comes equipped with a powerful 3-horsepower, 1-phase, 230-volt motor mounted in a cast-iron mechanism that controls cutter height. This mechanism is operated by the large, 8-inch-diameter cast-iron hand wheel (with spinner) conveniently located on the front of the base cabinet. For smooth, slip-free power transmission, the motor is fitted with a two-speed pulley system that uses a Poly-V belt--a magnetic switch protects against power fluctuations. All the controls, including a quick-release lever for fast speed and belt changing, are conveniently grouped within easy reach. For ease of movement, this sturdy, 664-pound machine has four retractable full-swivel casters (patent pending) with tough polyurethane tires that roll smoothly without leaving marks on your shop floor. Easy Spindle Adjustments The 3/4-inch- and 1-1/4-inch-diameter spindles are retained with a tough drawbar and locking nut, and offer speeds from 7,500 to 10,000 rpm. Height changes to within 1/1,000 of an inch--critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for raised panel doors--are simple thanks to the spinner handle on the cast-iron hand wheel. At the same time, the digital spindle-height display ensures accuracy. Extra-Large Cast-Iron Table To help simplify large projects, the PM2700 comes with a generously sized cast-iron flat table that stands a comfortable 35-1/2 inches (with casters retracted) from the floor for safe and easy handling of big materials. The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

The top features a full-size, T-shape miter slot that runs the full width of the table. Also, both rear corners of the table are pre-drilled and tapped to accept Powermatic feeding systems. Sophisticated Fence System This shaper includes a sophisticated, safe, and accurate fence system, including several T-slots, so you can mount a wood face and create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The design allows for quick movement of the fence close to its final position. It's then easy to lock it in and use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in the exact position needed. It also comes with two featherboards to help keep cuts consistent while improving safety. The PM2700 is backed by a five-year warranty. What's in the Box One Powermatic PM2700 3-horsepower shaper, one fence assembly, one cabinet and base, two lock handles, two M13 flat washers, one miter assembly, one draw bar, one 1-1/4-inch spindle, one 3/4-inch spindle, two spindle nuts, one 3-7/8-inch insert ring, four M10 socket head cap screws, four M10 lock washers, one starting pin, one 8-millimeter hex wrench, one cross-point/flat-head screwdriver, one wrench, one warranty card, and one manual. From the Manufacturer This new PM2700 shaper offers more features to you than any other shaper in the same class. The extra large 30-Inch by 40-Inch precision ground cast iron table includes a heavy duty miter gauge with an aluminum extruded support. The built-in, omni-directional caster system (patent pending) is retractable into the base. A quick-release lever allows fast speed and belt changes. The extruded aluminum fence has several T-slots so you can mount a wood face to create a no-clearance surface around any shaper or router bit. The fence also gives you the ability to quickly move the fence close to its final position, lock it in and then use the precision micro adjustments on each side of the cutter to dial in exactly the position you need. Adding to the precision of this machine is a digital readout for the spindle height. This allows making adjustments to within .001-Inch in the spindle height, which is critical when aligning rail and stile cutters for those raised panel doors.

As the market for automotive refurbishing began to take off in the 1970s, Curt realized that proper tools and techniques could save enthusiasts like him time and money. So in the fall of 1978, Curt launched a business to better serve the burgeoning market of auto restoration and customization hobbyists, and he called it Eastwood. Since its inception, Eastwood recognizes that change constantly takes place in the marketplace, and so strives to stay abreast of these developments by placing customers' wants and needs at the forefront. In recent years, the market for automotive hobbyists has expanded beyond the \"classics\", and Eastwood has seen increased requests for products geared towards muscle cars, street rods, trucks, and motorcycles. The explosion of the sport tuner hobby has demanded products that emphasize ease-of-use and variety, as customizers strive to make their vehicles truly unique. In response, the company has continued to be an industry pioneer, adding innovative, high-quality products to its line.
