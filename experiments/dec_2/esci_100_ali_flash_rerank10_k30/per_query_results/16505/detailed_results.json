In its first year the company employed 4 people and built approximately 2,000 fans. As sales continued to grow, the company moved to a larger facility in Capac, Michigan, in 1995. In an unfortunate turn of events, a devastating fire followed the move in January of 1997, resulting in a total loss. Incredibly, the company rebounded much faster than the industry or the community anticipated. In just eleven days Fan-Tastic Vent was able to resume production. In 2010, Fan-Tastic Vent was acquired by Atwood Mobile Products LLC, a leading supplier to the recreation vehicle industry. Today Fan-Tastic Vent continues to be one of the most recognized brand names in the industry and has sold over 3 million fans. Product Description About Fan-Tastic Vent: Fan-Tastic Vent was chartered as a stock corporation in 1984 and in 1985 began production of a 12-volt high efficiency ceiling fan in Burton, Michigan. In its first year the company employed 4 people and built approximately 2,000 fans. As sales continued to grow, the company moved to a larger facility in Capac, Michigan, in 1995. In an unfortunate turn of events, a devastating fire followed the move in January of 1997, resulting in a total loss. Incredibly, the company rebounded much faster than the industry or the community anticipated. In just eleven days Fan-Tastic Vent was able to resume production. In 2010, Fan-Tastic Vent was acquired by Atwood Mobile Products LLC, a leading supplier to the recreation vehicle industry. Today Fan-Tastic Vent continues to be one of the most recognized brand names in the industry and has sold over 3 million fans.From the manufacturer Read more Read more Model 1200 Model 1250 Model 2250 Model 7350 10 blade fan \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Self sealing vent cover \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Multiple fan speeds \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Reversible air flow \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Automated temperature control \u2713 \u2713 Remote control \u2713 Motorized vent cover \u2713 Motorized vent cover \u2713\n\n832072: AC Infinity AXIAL LS1238, Quiet Muffin Fan, 120V AC 120mm x 38mm Low Speed, UL-Certified for DIY Cooling Ventilation Exhaust Projects\tFrom the brand Previous page AC Infinity is a technology company that specializes in environmental controls for audio/video and HVAC.

Summer Mode - In the Summer, Westinghouse ceiling fans keep you pleasantly cool. Run your ceiling fan counterclockwise in the Summer to set air in motion. Winter Mode - In the Winter, Westinghouse ceiling fans can be reversed to rotate in the clockwise direction. As a result, the warm air that collects near the ceiling is distributed evenly throughout the room, eliminating cold spots and drafts. Ceiling fan blades should be at least 7 feet from the floor, but no higher than 8 - 9 feet. For ceilings 9 feet and higher, an extension down rod is recommended to place ceiling fan at correct height for optimum performance. Combo Mount This ceiling fan can be installed with or without the included down rod. In rooms with low ceilings, installing the fan without the down rod will increase the distance between the floor and the fan blades. It can also be installed with an extension down rod (sold separately). Read more Since 1946, Westinghouse Lighting has built and maintained a solid reputation as a trusted global brand.
