We all know a gallon a day keeps the wrinkles and brain fog away, and of course it\u2019s necessary for weight loss, healthy body functions and, well\u2026 LIFE! But drinking water is hard.

But look, we don\u2019t need cheesy statements, we need practical REMINDING that ends at a suitable time! The Right Time Markings, for the Right Hydration When it comes to water bottles there are three things everyone agrees on. It needs to fit a day\u2019s hydration, time marks should be encouraging and it needs to be practical. Now, do you like getting up in the early hours to go bathroom? Then forget bottles that end at 9pm! Instead, Life Bottle takes care of you from 7am to 7pm so your body gets full hydration AND a full nights\u2019 rest. Fill yours to the 7am line, or the Gallon Mark. You choose because ANYTHING above half a gallon is perfect!

We at Unconditional Rosie hope you are having an amazing day, and thank you for the opportunity of showing you today our baby memory book. This is a baby's first year memory book , which will help you easily capture all the special memories of your baby's first year on this world. The theme we chose for this book is \"space\", - because lots of toddlers out there really wish they can be astronauts when they grow up. By the way, if your kid is wishing to be an astronaut, encourage him! There is nothing impossible in this world, and we are sure he can actually achieve this if he sets his mind on it. Now getting back to the book :-) What are the benefits of this book versus the other options? This book is responsibly printed on thick matte paper, so that writing on top of it is easy and the ink won\u2019t ever smudge. It includes 12 milestone stickers , so that you can paste on your baby\u2019s belly and take the cutest pictures ever. This alone is a $9.99 value when sold separately from other brands. We decided to include it for \u201cfree\u201d because we found out that printing them was actually very inexpensive, so we figured we could add it as an extra bonus included with the baby book.

And, the unique, patented two piece nipple and wide neck design is a cinch to assemble and easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher.

And there\u2019s a new textured area to write in the contents as well as a 25% larger opening for easier filling & cleaning. What makes the GoToob+ better? The new generation of humangear\u2019s original, patented bottle. Used and trusted by more travelers than any imitation product. Premium silicone from a US-based manufacturer. Designed in the USA by a 10+ year-old company, not just a faceless \u2018company.\u2019 Specialized patented shape optimizes packability. Lifetime warranty.
