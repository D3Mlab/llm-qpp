It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives. Developed by our in-house chemists, our formulations are proprietary, structural, and marine grade. These epoxies have set the standard for epoxy quality in the marine industry and beyond since 1969.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats. Many of the wood/epoxy construction techniques that have made modern wooden boats so successful can also be applied to the repair of older wooden boats with excellent results. Gougeon Brothers, Inc., the company that has been formulating and manufacturing WEST SYSTEM Epoxies since 1969. They pioneered the use of epoxy to enhance wood's natural structural properties. Ease of use, ready availability, safety and easy access to instructional materials makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy a great choice for wooden boat construction and repairs. Furniture & Crafts The Eat a Peach Tribute Guitar using marquetry skills and WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Whether you're creating a river table, casting jewelry and works of art, making high-end knives, repairing sporting equipment, creating sculptures for public spaces, designing cosplay props, or building or repairing musical instruments, WEST SYSTEM Epoxy is versatile and reliable. Woodworkers and creators of all kinds depend on WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Home Repairs & Improvements The detail work on this Victorian home was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Homeowners rely on WEST SYSTEM Epoxy because it's versatile, reliable, readily available, consistent, and offers excellent instructional materials. WEST SYSTEM customers have used it to create spiral staircases, grand entry columns, and cherry wood basins. They've used it to build fences, trellises, and planter boxes, and neighborhood mini-libraries that can withstand decades outdoors. And to repair everything from porches and wooden window sashes to fiberglass tub and shower surfaces. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy an ideal adhesive and coating for lasting home repairs.

Start with 105 Epoxy Resin, the basic ingredient of all WEST SYSTEM Epoxy compounds. Use 300 Mini Pumps for convenient and accurate metering. 2. Mix with one of four WEST SYSTEM hardeners. Select a hardener for its intended use and for the cure speed best suited for your job in the temperature range in which you are working. 3. Add one of six WEST SYSTEM fillers to thicken the mixture as needed. Select a filler for its handling characteristics or cured physical properties. Or, add WEST SYSTEM additives to provide specific coating properties. WEST SYSTEM pigments can be used to change the epoxy's color. 105 Resin/205 Fast Hardener 105 Resin/206 Slow Hardener 105 Resin/207 Special Clear Hardener 105 Resin/209 Extra Slow Hardener Mix ratio, resin:hardener 5:1 w/105 Resin 5:1 w/105 Resin 3:1 w/105 Resin 3:1 w/105 Resin Pot life @72\u00b0F 12 minutes 21.5 minutes 22 minutes 62 minutes Working time, thin film @72\u00b0F 60 to 70 minutes 90 to 110 minutes 110 to 120 minutes 3 to 4 hours (180 to 240 minutes) Cures to a solid, thin film @72\u00b0F 6 to 8 hours 10 to 15 hours 10 to 15 hours 20 to 24 hours Cures to working strength @72\u00b0F 1 to 4 days 1 to 4 days 1 to 4 days 4 to 9 days Minimum working temp 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C) 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C) 70\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) Hardness (Shore D) ASTM D-2240 83 83 84.4 82 Compression yield (ASTM D-685 11,400 psi 11,500 psi 11,000 psi 12,000 psi Tensile strength ASTM D-638 7,900 psi 7,300 psi 6,750 psi 7,300 psi Flexural strength ASTM D-790 14,100 psi 11,800psi 11,300 psi 12,500 psi An ISO 9001:2015 certified company Founded in 1969, Gougeon Brothers, Inc.

Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

Zircon StudSensor i65 Electronic Wall Scanner Center Finding Stud Finder with Live AC WireWarning Detection. Locate Wood and Metal Studs Safely and Efficiently The Zircon StudSensor i65 is a handheld tool dedicated to quickly and easily find the edges and center of wood and metal studs and joists. This tool comes equipped with 2 scanning modes to allow its user to find studs up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep behind walls, floors and ceilings. StudScan mode allows the SS i65 to locate the center and edges of shallower wood or metal studs up to .75 of an inch (19 mm) deep. Switch over to DeepScan mode by quickly pressing the Power Button twice to double the scanning depth to 1.5 inches (38 mm). The StudSensor i65 has additional features that automatically operate in both scanning modes. These features allow the user to be safe by avoiding electrical dangers as well as common calibration and scanning errors. While WireWarning Detection works to alert you of live, unshielded AC wiring while scanning in either mode ACT (Auto Correcting Technology) simultaneously operates to automatically correct common calibration errors, such as when scanning begins over a stud. Before use, always be sure to install a brand new 9V battery. Zircon stud finders, particularly those with LCD screens, require and consume a great deal of current from batteries. For optimal performance, brand-new, recently purchased alkaline batteries, with an extended expiration date are strongly recommended for use in these tools. To begin, place the unit flat against the wall. Press the Power Button to calibrate the sensor. Once you hear a beep indicating calibration is complete. ALWAYS be sure to calibrate your stud finder before scanning. Once the i65 is calibrated, continue to hold the Power Button and slowly slide the tool across the surface. As the stud finder detects the edge of a stud, 'Edge' will appear in the LCD screen. Continue to slide the tool along the wall until you hear an audio tone and see both the SpotLite Pointer as well as 'Center' on the LCD. These signs indicate the center of the stud has been found. Make sure to note whether the WireWarning Detection is alerting to live, unshielded AC wiring before drilling into the center of the stud. Read more StudSensor i65 Features Edge Finding When using the i65 to scan for a stud, you will first be notified when the stud's edge is detected. All of the Middle Bars will be to one side and 'Edge' will appear on the LCD screen. Be sure not to drill at the edge of the stud. Continue to scan the surface until the stud's center is detected. Center Finding When you hear an audio tone and see both the SpotLite Pointer as well as 'Center' on the LCD screen. These signs indicate the center of the stud has been found. The center of the stud center is the stud's most secure location. It is critical to drill in the center when mounting heavy objects. WireWarning Detection WireWarning Detection is a feature that is always on while you are scanning in StudScan and DeepScan modes. It alerts you to the presence of live, unshielded, electrical AC wires up to 2 inches (50 cm) deep. As you approach an area with live AC voltage, an 'AC' and lightning bolt icon will display in the top left corner of the LCD screen. If your scan directly starts over an area with live AC voltage, the WireWarning Icon will flash. Note: Please turn off the electricity and use extreme caution in areas where live AC voltage is detected before nailing or drilling. Auto Correcting Technology (ACT) Auto Correcting Technology (ACT) is a feature that enables the tool to automatically adjust for common calibration errors. It checks calibration 10 times per second and automatically recalibrates when/if needed. If scanning begins directly over a stud, the tool will transparently recalibrate, so you don\u2019t have to, and will find that stud when you scan back over it. This recalibration is usually transparent and no indication is made. If an arrow icon illuminates, the tool was calibrated near or over a stud and then moved away. The arrow indicates the direction of the missed stud.

Answer: No. Zircon stud finders and detectors, particularly those with LCD screens, require and consume a great deal of current from batteries. For optimal performance, a brand-new, recently purchased 9V alkaline battery, with an extended expiration date is not included but is required to properly power the i65. Question: I inserted a 9V battery, but the tool doesn\u2019t turn on or is giving me strange readings. Is my tool broken? Answer: Please be sure to use a fresh, brand new 9V alkaline battery with an extended expiration date. Batteries that may work in a smoke detector or remote control may not have adequate voltage to power the sensing technology in stud finders. Question: Does the stud finder need to be calibrated? Answer: Yes, as with all Zircon stud finders, the StudSensor i65 needs to calibrate to the surface before scanning. Calibrating the stud finder on an empty wall gives the device a chance to measure the wall thickness and material density, as well as register factors like humidity, temperature, and even the minor electric readings from your hand, which all have an impact on the readings from the wall. Calibrating is easy and just takes a second. To calibrate, simply place the unit flat against the surface to be scanned and press the Power Button. When powering the i65 on, all the icons on the screen and the SpotLite Pointer will briefly flash, the tool will beep, and the screen will then clear with the word \u201cStud\u201d remaining. This indicates that calibration has occurred and the tool is ready to begin scanning. It is important not to move the tool or begin scanning until the calibration process has taken place for the most accurate results. Question: What does 'Center Finding' mean? Answer: Center Finding stud finders locate both the edges, AND the center, of wood and metal studs and joists in one step. 'Edge Finding' stud finders, on the other hand, only find the edges of studs, so you must determine the center. Finding the center of the stud to mount heavy objects is critical as the stud\u2019s center is the most secure location of the stud. Question: What is DeepScan mode? Answer: Unlike StudScan mode which scans through one layer of drywall up to 0.75 inch thick (19 mm), DeepScan mode scans through 2 layers of drywall up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep. DeepScan mode is a higher sensitivity scanning mode that should be used when there are extra layers of wallboard or paneling. Extra layers in a wall can make it difficult to find studs in regular StudScan mode. To minimize false positives and/or finding other objects further behind the wall that may not be a stud, always start your scan in StudScan mode first. Question: How do I scan in DeepScan mode? Answer: With the unit still placed flat against the wall and turned on, quickly (within one second) release and re-press the Power Button. The Stud Scan mode indication will flash continuously, indicating that the tool has entered High Sensitivity (DeepScan) mode. Question: How can I be certain the objects found behind my wall are studs in DeepScan mode? Answer: DeepScan mode has increased sensitivity so you may have located something other than a stud. Studs are equally spaced to either side (12, 16, or 24 in. apart) and typically run from floor to ceiling. To better confirm that what you found is a stud, check for other studs equally spaced to either side or for the same stud at several heights directly above and below the first stud indication. A stud reading would also measure approximately 1.5 in. (38 mm) apart from each edge. Anything larger or smaller may not be a stud if not near a door or window. Question: What is Auto Correcting Technology (ACT)? Answer: Auto Correcting Technology (ACT) is a feature that enables the tool to automatically adjust for common calibration errors. It checks calibration 10 times per second and automatically recalibrates when/if needed. If scanning begins directly over a stud, the tool will transparently recalibrate, so you don\u2019t have to, and will find that stud when you scan back over it. Some models will point an arrow in the direction of the stud when you move away. Models without ACT will give you an over-the-stud indication (flashing and beeping), alerting you to start your scan over a few inches to the left or right of your original scan. Question: What is WireWarning? Answer: WireWarning Detection is a feature that is always on while you are scanning in StudScan and DeepScan modes to alert you to the presence of live, unshielded, electrical AC wires up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep. As you approach an area with live AC voltage, an 'AC' and lightning bolt icon will display in the top left corner of the LCD screen. This is the WireWarning Detection Icon. If your scan directly starts over an area with live AC voltage, the 'AC' and lightning bolt icon will flash. Please turn off the electricity and use extreme caution in areas where live AC voltage is detected before nailing or drilling. Question: Will this StudSensor i65 locate metal studs? Answer: Yes, the SS i65 will locate metal studs. Since stud finders are looking for a change in density behind dry wall, not a particular material, they will react to metal as well as wooden studs. The i65 will locate wood and metal studs up to 0.75 inches (19 mm) deep while DeepScan mode locates targets up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep. Question: Does the SS i65 work on wood paneling and other wood surfaces? Answer: The i65 is optimized to scan through standard interior sheetrock / drywall (gypsum) construction. This tool will work on wood, plywood, wood paneling and particle board up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) thick. Question: Will the i65 work on textured wall surfaces, acoustic ceilings, or wall paper? Answer: Yes, the SS i65 will work on textured surfaces and dried wall paper as long as it does not contain any metallic foil or fibers. For highly textured walls or acoustic ceilings, place or tape a thin piece of cardboard onto the surface to be scanned. Recalibrate and scan over the cardboard in DeepScan mode. Question: Can I use this stud finder to find studs behind carpet? Answer: No. Zircon stud finders are designed for hollow interior walls. They will generally work well to find studs or joists through a plywood subfloor, after the carpeting/flooring has been removed. Question: Will the SS i65 work on ceramic tile? Answer: While the i65 may be able to read through ceramic tile, the many variable layers behind tiled surfaces make it one of the more difficult scanning environments. A Zircon MultiScanner with Metal Scan mode or a dedicated metal scanner from the Zircon MetalliScanner line is recommended to more accurately locate the nails or screw heads in deeper and/or difficult scanning areas. Question: Does this StudSensor work on lath and plaster? Answer: No, due to the inconsistent nature in which lath and plaster is constructed, the SSi65 cannot scan on lath and plaster walls. A Zircon MultiScanner with Metal Scan mode or a dedicated metal scanner from the Zircon MetalliScanner line can be used to easily locate the nails or screw heads that attach the wood lath to the studs. Question: Can I use this stud finder to scan the outside wall of my house? Answer: No. Zircon StudSensors are designed and recommended for interior use only. Question: I'm planning on mounting my new flat screen TV to the wall. Will this stud finder help me? Answer: Yes. The SS i65 is perfect for basic home or office jobs. The center-finding technology allows you to find and easily mark the center of the stud for secure mounting of TV's, and AV equipment, closet or garage shelving, heavy mirrors, light fixtures, coat racks and more. Question: Is the tool waterproof? Answer: No. The StudSensor i65 is splash and water resistant, but not waterproof. Question: What is the difference between magnetic and electronic stud finders? Answer: Magnetic stud finders are simply magnets that look for anything magnetic behind a wall. Typically, they are advertised to find screws or nails that hold the wall surface to the studs. However, nails often times are not placed in the center of studs making it difficult to determine where the stud\u2019s center is or how wide the stud is. Electronic stud finders, such as the i65, on the other hand, operate by detecting density changes behind a surface (like a wall) and will clearly and precisely indicate the edges and center of a stud. The center of a stud is the most secure location when mounting anything heavy. For applications like mapping out floor joists electronic stud finders have an advantage over magnets because they are not attracted to nails holding floor boards to a subfloor as well as nails in joists. Question: Does the StudSensor i65 come with a warranty? Answer: The StudSensor i65 comes with a limited one year warranty when fulfilled by and shipped from Amazon.

Fits Thule rack systems, round bars and most factory racks. Review The Thule 624 Force L Roof Box is a new addition in Thule's hard-shelled cargo carrier product line that features a winning combination of value and space, while still offering key conveniences important to every user. The roof box has a 13 cubic foot interior capacity, and utilizes AeroSkin technology that results in a durable and the aerodynamic shape. Additional features include: tool-free Quick-Grip mounting, oversized SecureLock, dual-side lid opening, and four size choices to fit the vehicle and hauling needs of different users. An affordable and dependable rack top cargo box option blending value and space options. View larger A Blend of Design, Convenience and Style The Thule Force Roof Box product line is designed from the ground up to provide users with a dependable and durable product that can be counted on to last for the long haul. It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way. Diamond-textured AeroSkin lid design decreases wind-resistance, producing a quieter ride, and perhaps improved MPG.

About Thule Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.

Review The Thule 624 Force L Roof Box is a new addition in Thule's hard-shelled cargo carrier product line that features a winning combination of value and space, while still offering key conveniences important to every user. The roof box has a 13 cubic foot interior capacity, and utilizes AeroSkin technology that results in a durable and the aerodynamic shape. Additional features include: tool-free Quick-Grip mounting, oversized SecureLock, dual-side lid opening, and four size choices to fit the vehicle and hauling needs of different users. An affordable and dependable rack top cargo box option blending value and space options. View larger A Blend of Design, Convenience and Style The Thule Force Roof Box product line is designed from the ground up to provide users with a dependable and durable product that can be counted on to last for the long haul. It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way. Diamond-textured AeroSkin lid design decreases wind-resistance, producing a quieter ride, and perhaps improved MPG.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives. Developed by our in-house chemists, our formulations are proprietary, structural, and marine grade. These epoxies have set the standard for epoxy quality in the marine industry and beyond since 1969.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats. Many of the wood/epoxy construction techniques that have made modern wooden boats so successful can also be applied to the repair of older wooden boats with excellent results. Gougeon Brothers, Inc., the company that has been formulating and manufacturing WEST SYSTEM Epoxies since 1969. They pioneered the use of epoxy to enhance wood's natural structural properties. Ease of use, ready availability, safety and easy access to instructional materials makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy a great choice for wooden boat construction and repairs. Furniture & Crafts The Eat a Peach Tribute Guitar using marquetry skills and WEST SYSTEM Epoxy.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

Zircon StudSensor i65 Electronic Wall Scanner Center Finding Stud Finder with Live AC WireWarning Detection. Locate Wood and Metal Studs Safely and Efficiently The Zircon StudSensor i65 is a handheld tool dedicated to quickly and easily find the edges and center of wood and metal studs and joists. This tool comes equipped with 2 scanning modes to allow its user to find studs up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep behind walls, floors and ceilings. StudScan mode allows the SS i65 to locate the center and edges of shallower wood or metal studs up to .75 of an inch (19 mm) deep. Switch over to DeepScan mode by quickly pressing the Power Button twice to double the scanning depth to 1.5 inches (38 mm). The StudSensor i65 has additional features that automatically operate in both scanning modes. These features allow the user to be safe by avoiding electrical dangers as well as common calibration and scanning errors. While WireWarning Detection works to alert you of live, unshielded AC wiring while scanning in either mode ACT (Auto Correcting Technology) simultaneously operates to automatically correct common calibration errors, such as when scanning begins over a stud. Before use, always be sure to install a brand new 9V battery. Zircon stud finders, particularly those with LCD screens, require and consume a great deal of current from batteries. For optimal performance, brand-new, recently purchased alkaline batteries, with an extended expiration date are strongly recommended for use in these tools. To begin, place the unit flat against the wall. Press the Power Button to calibrate the sensor. Once you hear a beep indicating calibration is complete. ALWAYS be sure to calibrate your stud finder before scanning. Once the i65 is calibrated, continue to hold the Power Button and slowly slide the tool across the surface. As the stud finder detects the edge of a stud, 'Edge' will appear in the LCD screen. Continue to slide the tool along the wall until you hear an audio tone and see both the SpotLite Pointer as well as 'Center' on the LCD. These signs indicate the center of the stud has been found. Make sure to note whether the WireWarning Detection is alerting to live, unshielded AC wiring before drilling into the center of the stud. Read more StudSensor i65 Features Edge Finding When using the i65 to scan for a stud, you will first be notified when the stud's edge is detected. All of the Middle Bars will be to one side and 'Edge' will appear on the LCD screen. Be sure not to drill at the edge of the stud. Continue to scan the surface until the stud's center is detected. Center Finding When you hear an audio tone and see both the SpotLite Pointer as well as 'Center' on the LCD screen. These signs indicate the center of the stud has been found. The center of the stud center is the stud's most secure location. It is critical to drill in the center when mounting heavy objects. WireWarning Detection WireWarning Detection is a feature that is always on while you are scanning in StudScan and DeepScan modes. It alerts you to the presence of live, unshielded, electrical AC wires up to 2 inches (50 cm) deep. As you approach an area with live AC voltage, an 'AC' and lightning bolt icon will display in the top left corner of the LCD screen. If your scan directly starts over an area with live AC voltage, the WireWarning Icon will flash. Note: Please turn off the electricity and use extreme caution in areas where live AC voltage is detected before nailing or drilling. Auto Correcting Technology (ACT) Auto Correcting Technology (ACT) is a feature that enables the tool to automatically adjust for common calibration errors. It checks calibration 10 times per second and automatically recalibrates when/if needed. If scanning begins directly over a stud, the tool will transparently recalibrate, so you don\u2019t have to, and will find that stud when you scan back over it. This recalibration is usually transparent and no indication is made. If an arrow icon illuminates, the tool was calibrated near or over a stud and then moved away. The arrow indicates the direction of the missed stud.

Answer: No. Zircon stud finders and detectors, particularly those with LCD screens, require and consume a great deal of current from batteries. For optimal performance, a brand-new, recently purchased 9V alkaline battery, with an extended expiration date is not included but is required to properly power the i65. Question: I inserted a 9V battery, but the tool doesn\u2019t turn on or is giving me strange readings. Is my tool broken? Answer: Please be sure to use a fresh, brand new 9V alkaline battery with an extended expiration date. Batteries that may work in a smoke detector or remote control may not have adequate voltage to power the sensing technology in stud finders. Question: Does the stud finder need to be calibrated? Answer: Yes, as with all Zircon stud finders, the StudSensor i65 needs to calibrate to the surface before scanning. Calibrating the stud finder on an empty wall gives the device a chance to measure the wall thickness and material density, as well as register factors like humidity, temperature, and even the minor electric readings from your hand, which all have an impact on the readings from the wall. Calibrating is easy and just takes a second. To calibrate, simply place the unit flat against the surface to be scanned and press the Power Button. When powering the i65 on, all the icons on the screen and the SpotLite Pointer will briefly flash, the tool will beep, and the screen will then clear with the word \u201cStud\u201d remaining. This indicates that calibration has occurred and the tool is ready to begin scanning. It is important not to move the tool or begin scanning until the calibration process has taken place for the most accurate results. Question: What does 'Center Finding' mean? Answer: Center Finding stud finders locate both the edges, AND the center, of wood and metal studs and joists in one step. 'Edge Finding' stud finders, on the other hand, only find the edges of studs, so you must determine the center. Finding the center of the stud to mount heavy objects is critical as the stud\u2019s center is the most secure location of the stud. Question: What is DeepScan mode? Answer: Unlike StudScan mode which scans through one layer of drywall up to 0.75 inch thick (19 mm), DeepScan mode scans through 2 layers of drywall up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep. DeepScan mode is a higher sensitivity scanning mode that should be used when there are extra layers of wallboard or paneling. Extra layers in a wall can make it difficult to find studs in regular StudScan mode. To minimize false positives and/or finding other objects further behind the wall that may not be a stud, always start your scan in StudScan mode first. Question: How do I scan in DeepScan mode? Answer: With the unit still placed flat against the wall and turned on, quickly (within one second) release and re-press the Power Button. The Stud Scan mode indication will flash continuously, indicating that the tool has entered High Sensitivity (DeepScan) mode. Question: How can I be certain the objects found behind my wall are studs in DeepScan mode? Answer: DeepScan mode has increased sensitivity so you may have located something other than a stud. Studs are equally spaced to either side (12, 16, or 24 in. apart) and typically run from floor to ceiling. To better confirm that what you found is a stud, check for other studs equally spaced to either side or for the same stud at several heights directly above and below the first stud indication. A stud reading would also measure approximately 1.5 in. (38 mm) apart from each edge. Anything larger or smaller may not be a stud if not near a door or window. Question: What is Auto Correcting Technology (ACT)? Answer: Auto Correcting Technology (ACT) is a feature that enables the tool to automatically adjust for common calibration errors. It checks calibration 10 times per second and automatically recalibrates when/if needed. If scanning begins directly over a stud, the tool will transparently recalibrate, so you don\u2019t have to, and will find that stud when you scan back over it. Some models will point an arrow in the direction of the stud when you move away. Models without ACT will give you an over-the-stud indication (flashing and beeping), alerting you to start your scan over a few inches to the left or right of your original scan. Question: What is WireWarning? Answer: WireWarning Detection is a feature that is always on while you are scanning in StudScan and DeepScan modes to alert you to the presence of live, unshielded, electrical AC wires up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep. As you approach an area with live AC voltage, an 'AC' and lightning bolt icon will display in the top left corner of the LCD screen. This is the WireWarning Detection Icon. If your scan directly starts over an area with live AC voltage, the 'AC' and lightning bolt icon will flash. Please turn off the electricity and use extreme caution in areas where live AC voltage is detected before nailing or drilling. Question: Will this StudSensor i65 locate metal studs? Answer: Yes, the SS i65 will locate metal studs. Since stud finders are looking for a change in density behind dry wall, not a particular material, they will react to metal as well as wooden studs. The i65 will locate wood and metal studs up to 0.75 inches (19 mm) deep while DeepScan mode locates targets up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep. Question: Does the SS i65 work on wood paneling and other wood surfaces? Answer: The i65 is optimized to scan through standard interior sheetrock / drywall (gypsum) construction. This tool will work on wood, plywood, wood paneling and particle board up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) thick. Question: Will the i65 work on textured wall surfaces, acoustic ceilings, or wall paper? Answer: Yes, the SS i65 will work on textured surfaces and dried wall paper as long as it does not contain any metallic foil or fibers. For highly textured walls or acoustic ceilings, place or tape a thin piece of cardboard onto the surface to be scanned. Recalibrate and scan over the cardboard in DeepScan mode. Question: Can I use this stud finder to find studs behind carpet? Answer: No. Zircon stud finders are designed for hollow interior walls. They will generally work well to find studs or joists through a plywood subfloor, after the carpeting/flooring has been removed. Question: Will the SS i65 work on ceramic tile? Answer: While the i65 may be able to read through ceramic tile, the many variable layers behind tiled surfaces make it one of the more difficult scanning environments. A Zircon MultiScanner with Metal Scan mode or a dedicated metal scanner from the Zircon MetalliScanner line is recommended to more accurately locate the nails or screw heads in deeper and/or difficult scanning areas. Question: Does this StudSensor work on lath and plaster? Answer: No, due to the inconsistent nature in which lath and plaster is constructed, the SSi65 cannot scan on lath and plaster walls. A Zircon MultiScanner with Metal Scan mode or a dedicated metal scanner from the Zircon MetalliScanner line can be used to easily locate the nails or screw heads that attach the wood lath to the studs. Question: Can I use this stud finder to scan the outside wall of my house? Answer: No. Zircon StudSensors are designed and recommended for interior use only. Question: I'm planning on mounting my new flat screen TV to the wall. Will this stud finder help me? Answer: Yes. The SS i65 is perfect for basic home or office jobs. The center-finding technology allows you to find and easily mark the center of the stud for secure mounting of TV's, and AV equipment, closet or garage shelving, heavy mirrors, light fixtures, coat racks and more. Question: Is the tool waterproof? Answer: No. The StudSensor i65 is splash and water resistant, but not waterproof. Question: What is the difference between magnetic and electronic stud finders? Answer: Magnetic stud finders are simply magnets that look for anything magnetic behind a wall. Typically, they are advertised to find screws or nails that hold the wall surface to the studs. However, nails often times are not placed in the center of studs making it difficult to determine where the stud\u2019s center is or how wide the stud is. Electronic stud finders, such as the i65, on the other hand, operate by detecting density changes behind a surface (like a wall) and will clearly and precisely indicate the edges and center of a stud. The center of a stud is the most secure location when mounting anything heavy. For applications like mapping out floor joists electronic stud finders have an advantage over magnets because they are not attracted to nails holding floor boards to a subfloor as well as nails in joists. Question: Does the StudSensor i65 come with a warranty? Answer: The StudSensor i65 comes with a limited one year warranty when fulfilled by and shipped from Amazon.

Fits Thule rack systems, round bars and most factory racks. Review The Thule 624 Force L Roof Box is a new addition in Thule's hard-shelled cargo carrier product line that features a winning combination of value and space, while still offering key conveniences important to every user. The roof box has a 13 cubic foot interior capacity, and utilizes AeroSkin technology that results in a durable and the aerodynamic shape. Additional features include: tool-free Quick-Grip mounting, oversized SecureLock, dual-side lid opening, and four size choices to fit the vehicle and hauling needs of different users. An affordable and dependable rack top cargo box option blending value and space options. View larger A Blend of Design, Convenience and Style The Thule Force Roof Box product line is designed from the ground up to provide users with a dependable and durable product that can be counted on to last for the long haul. It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way. Diamond-textured AeroSkin lid design decreases wind-resistance, producing a quieter ride, and perhaps improved MPG.

About Thule Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.

Review The Thule 624 Force L Roof Box is a new addition in Thule's hard-shelled cargo carrier product line that features a winning combination of value and space, while still offering key conveniences important to every user. The roof box has a 13 cubic foot interior capacity, and utilizes AeroSkin technology that results in a durable and the aerodynamic shape. Additional features include: tool-free Quick-Grip mounting, oversized SecureLock, dual-side lid opening, and four size choices to fit the vehicle and hauling needs of different users. An affordable and dependable rack top cargo box option blending value and space options. View larger A Blend of Design, Convenience and Style The Thule Force Roof Box product line is designed from the ground up to provide users with a dependable and durable product that can be counted on to last for the long haul. It succeeds in this by blending a convenient, feature-rich design, with value and space. The box's dominant design feature is its diamond-textured AeroSkin shell, constructed from durable five-layer ABS plastic. The lid holds up to the toughest weather conditions, and thanks to its aerodynamic shape, which pushes air away from the box encouraging smoother air flow, it can be left on year-round without a significant increase in noise. The reduction in drag through the aerodynamic design may also negate any impact to vehicle fuel efficiency. The Thule Force lid also offers the convenience of dual-side access. This means you can get to your gear whether you are on the driver, or the passenger side of the vehicle. And when the lid is open the its built-in lifter elements at the front and rear of the box hold the box open for you for hands-free access to gear. When you are done with your box, simply pull the lid closed, and built-in Thule SecureLock technology ensures that all edges of the lid are completely closed, and included locking functionality at the drivers side of the box ensure that it stays that way. Diamond-textured AeroSkin lid design decreases wind-resistance, producing a quieter ride, and perhaps improved MPG.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem.

TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy.

It can be easily thickened with a number of fillers to modify consistency and strength. There are two types of structural bonding that can be done with epoxy. TWO-STEP BONDING is the preferred method for most situations because it promotes maximum epoxy penetration into the bonding surface and prevents epoxy-starved joints. SINGLE-STEP BONDING is appropriate when joints will have minimal loads and excess epoxy absorption into porous surfaces is not a problem. In both cases, epoxy bonds best when it is worked into the surface with a roller or brush. Coating, Laminating & Clear Finishing COATING AND LAMINATING are popular uses of WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Epoxy wets out fiberglass cloth, protecting the substrate while letting its beauty shine through. We recommend WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin with blush-free, water-clear 207 Special Clear Hardener for bright finishes and clear coats. COATING involves rolling the epoxy onto a surface with a foam roller, applying it with a brush, or spreading the epoxy over the surfaces with a plastic spreader. . There are two methods for laminating with fiberglass and epoxy. THE DRY METHOD refers to placing the cloth over a dry surface, wetting the cloth with epoxy and spreading the epoxy over the cloth, smoothing it as you go. THE WET METHOD involves applying the cloth to an epoxy-coated surface after the wet-out coat becomes tacky, which helps it cling to vertical or overhead surfaces. This method makes it more difficult to position the cloth, so the dry method is the preferred, especially when using with thinner cloth. Clear Casting & Pouring CASTING AND POURING are best done with WEST SYSTEM 105 Resin and 207 Special Clear Hardener. AVOIDING UNCONTROLLED EXOTHERM is important, as this heat reaction can quickly spoil the casting. Epoxy cures by exothermic (heat) reaction. That heat must be kept under control when when creating a thick casting (greater than \u00bc\u201d). For thick castings, add epoxy in multiple layers . When the first pour is tacky like the back of masking tape, a second pour can be made. When the epoxy cures enough to become tacky, it means the previous layer has begun to cool down and will not contribute heat to the next layer. Adding another layer at this stage allows you to skip any surface prep. If the poured epoxy casting cures past the tacky stage, allow the epoxy to finish curing then sand ot dull and clean the surface before applying the next epoxy layer. This will ensure good adhesion between layers. Read more Versatile, reliable WEST SYSTEM products WEST SYSTEM offers high-quality epoxy resins, hardeners, fillers, and additives.

Fiberglass Boat Repairs & Construction This vintage 15' Larson Thunderhawk was repaired with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Damage from collisions, groundings, the forces of nature, and aging make it common for fiberglass boats to need repairs. Effectively repairing a fiberglass boat requires a superior structural adhesive, that adheres to polyester resin, fiberglass, wood, metal and other materials. Unlike polyester resin which can shrink from 5% to 8%, creating stress concentrations at the repair joint, epoxy doesn\u2019t shrink. It's also a more effective moisture barrier. Epoxy forms a tenacious mechanical bond with cured polyester and other materials in secondary bonding. Since epoxy is more durable than polyester, the epoxy repair may be even stronger than the original structure. Ease of use, ready availability, safety, and easy access to how-to information makes WEST SYSTEM Epoxy excellent for fiberglass boat repair. Wooden Boat Construction & Repairs This strip canoe was built with WEST SYSTEM Epoxy. Wood is the primary building material for many of today\u2019s most durable and most beautiful boats, whether canoes, kayaks, dories, sailboats or power boats.

Zircon StudSensor i65 Electronic Wall Scanner Center Finding Stud Finder with Live AC WireWarning Detection. Locate Wood and Metal Studs Safely and Efficiently The Zircon StudSensor i65 is a handheld tool dedicated to quickly and easily find the edges and center of wood and metal studs and joists. This tool comes equipped with 2 scanning modes to allow its user to find studs up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep behind walls, floors and ceilings. StudScan mode allows the SS i65 to locate the center and edges of shallower wood or metal studs up to .75 of an inch (19 mm) deep. Switch over to DeepScan mode by quickly pressing the Power Button twice to double the scanning depth to 1.5 inches (38 mm). The StudSensor i65 has additional features that automatically operate in both scanning modes. These features allow the user to be safe by avoiding electrical dangers as well as common calibration and scanning errors. While WireWarning Detection works to alert you of live, unshielded AC wiring while scanning in either mode ACT (Auto Correcting Technology) simultaneously operates to automatically correct common calibration errors, such as when scanning begins over a stud. Before use, always be sure to install a brand new 9V battery. Zircon stud finders, particularly those with LCD screens, require and consume a great deal of current from batteries. For optimal performance, brand-new, recently purchased alkaline batteries, with an extended expiration date are strongly recommended for use in these tools. To begin, place the unit flat against the wall. Press the Power Button to calibrate the sensor. Once you hear a beep indicating calibration is complete. ALWAYS be sure to calibrate your stud finder before scanning. Once the i65 is calibrated, continue to hold the Power Button and slowly slide the tool across the surface. As the stud finder detects the edge of a stud, 'Edge' will appear in the LCD screen. Continue to slide the tool along the wall until you hear an audio tone and see both the SpotLite Pointer as well as 'Center' on the LCD. These signs indicate the center of the stud has been found. Make sure to note whether the WireWarning Detection is alerting to live, unshielded AC wiring before drilling into the center of the stud. Read more StudSensor i65 Features Edge Finding When using the i65 to scan for a stud, you will first be notified when the stud's edge is detected. All of the Middle Bars will be to one side and 'Edge' will appear on the LCD screen. Be sure not to drill at the edge of the stud. Continue to scan the surface until the stud's center is detected. Center Finding When you hear an audio tone and see both the SpotLite Pointer as well as 'Center' on the LCD screen. These signs indicate the center of the stud has been found. The center of the stud center is the stud's most secure location. It is critical to drill in the center when mounting heavy objects. WireWarning Detection WireWarning Detection is a feature that is always on while you are scanning in StudScan and DeepScan modes. It alerts you to the presence of live, unshielded, electrical AC wires up to 2 inches (50 cm) deep. As you approach an area with live AC voltage, an 'AC' and lightning bolt icon will display in the top left corner of the LCD screen. If your scan directly starts over an area with live AC voltage, the WireWarning Icon will flash. Note: Please turn off the electricity and use extreme caution in areas where live AC voltage is detected before nailing or drilling. Auto Correcting Technology (ACT) Auto Correcting Technology (ACT) is a feature that enables the tool to automatically adjust for common calibration errors. It checks calibration 10 times per second and automatically recalibrates when/if needed. If scanning begins directly over a stud, the tool will transparently recalibrate, so you don\u2019t have to, and will find that stud when you scan back over it. This recalibration is usually transparent and no indication is made. If an arrow icon illuminates, the tool was calibrated near or over a stud and then moved away.

Answer: No. Zircon stud finders and detectors, particularly those with LCD screens, require and consume a great deal of current from batteries. For optimal performance, a brand-new, recently purchased 9V alkaline battery, with an extended expiration date is not included but is required to properly power the i65. Question: I inserted a 9V battery, but the tool doesn\u2019t turn on or is giving me strange readings. Is my tool broken? Answer: Please be sure to use a fresh, brand new 9V alkaline battery with an extended expiration date. Batteries that may work in a smoke detector or remote control may not have adequate voltage to power the sensing technology in stud finders. Question: Does the stud finder need to be calibrated? Answer: Yes, as with all Zircon stud finders, the StudSensor i65 needs to calibrate to the surface before scanning. Calibrating the stud finder on an empty wall gives the device a chance to measure the wall thickness and material density, as well as register factors like humidity, temperature, and even the minor electric readings from your hand, which all have an impact on the readings from the wall. Calibrating is easy and just takes a second. To calibrate, simply place the unit flat against the surface to be scanned and press the Power Button. When powering the i65 on, all the icons on the screen and the SpotLite Pointer will briefly flash, the tool will beep, and the screen will then clear with the word \u201cStud\u201d remaining. This indicates that calibration has occurred and the tool is ready to begin scanning. It is important not to move the tool or begin scanning until the calibration process has taken place for the most accurate results. Question: What does 'Center Finding' mean? Answer: Center Finding stud finders locate both the edges, AND the center, of wood and metal studs and joists in one step. 'Edge Finding' stud finders, on the other hand, only find the edges of studs, so you must determine the center. Finding the center of the stud to mount heavy objects is critical as the stud\u2019s center is the most secure location of the stud. Question: What is DeepScan mode? Answer: Unlike StudScan mode which scans through one layer of drywall up to 0.75 inch thick (19 mm), DeepScan mode scans through 2 layers of drywall up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep. DeepScan mode is a higher sensitivity scanning mode that should be used when there are extra layers of wallboard or paneling. Extra layers in a wall can make it difficult to find studs in regular StudScan mode. To minimize false positives and/or finding other objects further behind the wall that may not be a stud, always start your scan in StudScan mode first. Question: How do I scan in DeepScan mode? Answer: With the unit still placed flat against the wall and turned on, quickly (within one second) release and re-press the Power Button. The Stud Scan mode indication will flash continuously, indicating that the tool has entered High Sensitivity (DeepScan) mode. Question: How can I be certain the objects found behind my wall are studs in DeepScan mode? Answer: DeepScan mode has increased sensitivity so you may have located something other than a stud. Studs are equally spaced to either side (12, 16, or 24 in. apart) and typically run from floor to ceiling. To better confirm that what you found is a stud, check for other studs equally spaced to either side or for the same stud at several heights directly above and below the first stud indication. A stud reading would also measure approximately 1.5 in. (38 mm) apart from each edge. Anything larger or smaller may not be a stud if not near a door or window. Question: What is Auto Correcting Technology (ACT)? Answer: Auto Correcting Technology (ACT) is a feature that enables the tool to automatically adjust for common calibration errors. It checks calibration 10 times per second and automatically recalibrates when/if needed. If scanning begins directly over a stud, the tool will transparently recalibrate, so you don\u2019t have to, and will find that stud when you scan back over it. Some models will point an arrow in the direction of the stud when you move away. Models without ACT will give you an over-the-stud indication (flashing and beeping), alerting you to start your scan over a few inches to the left or right of your original scan. Question: What is WireWarning? Answer: WireWarning Detection is a feature that is always on while you are scanning in StudScan and DeepScan modes to alert you to the presence of live, unshielded, electrical AC wires up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep. As you approach an area with live AC voltage, an 'AC' and lightning bolt icon will display in the top left corner of the LCD screen. This is the WireWarning Detection Icon. If your scan directly starts over an area with live AC voltage, the 'AC' and lightning bolt icon will flash. Please turn off the electricity and use extreme caution in areas where live AC voltage is detected before nailing or drilling. Question: Will this StudSensor i65 locate metal studs? Answer: Yes, the SS i65 will locate metal studs. Since stud finders are looking for a change in density behind dry wall, not a particular material, they will react to metal as well as wooden studs. The i65 will locate wood and metal studs up to 0.75 inches (19 mm) deep while DeepScan mode locates targets up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep. Question: Does the SS i65 work on wood paneling and other wood surfaces? Answer: The i65 is optimized to scan through standard interior sheetrock / drywall (gypsum) construction. This tool will work on wood, plywood, wood paneling and particle board up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) thick. Question: Will the i65 work on textured wall surfaces, acoustic ceilings, or wall paper? Answer: Yes, the SS i65 will work on textured surfaces and dried wall paper as long as it does not contain any metallic foil or fibers. For highly textured walls or acoustic ceilings, place or tape a thin piece of cardboard onto the surface to be scanned. Recalibrate and scan over the cardboard in DeepScan mode. Question: Can I use this stud finder to find studs behind carpet? Answer: No. Zircon stud finders are designed for hollow interior walls. They will generally work well to find studs or joists through a plywood subfloor, after the carpeting/flooring has been removed. Question: Will the SS i65 work on ceramic tile? Answer: While the i65 may be able to read through ceramic tile, the many variable layers behind tiled surfaces make it one of the more difficult scanning environments. A Zircon MultiScanner with Metal Scan mode or a dedicated metal scanner from the Zircon MetalliScanner line is recommended to more accurately locate the nails or screw heads in deeper and/or difficult scanning areas. Question: Does this StudSensor work on lath and plaster? Answer: No, due to the inconsistent nature in which lath and plaster is constructed, the SSi65 cannot scan on lath and plaster walls. A Zircon MultiScanner with Metal Scan mode or a dedicated metal scanner from the Zircon MetalliScanner line can be used to easily locate the nails or screw heads that attach the wood lath to the studs. Question: Can I use this stud finder to scan the outside wall of my house? Answer: No. Zircon StudSensors are designed and recommended for interior use only. Question: I'm planning on mounting my new flat screen TV to the wall. Will this stud finder help me? Answer: Yes. The SS i65 is perfect for basic home or office jobs. The center-finding technology allows you to find and easily mark the center of the stud for secure mounting of TV's, and AV equipment, closet or garage shelving, heavy mirrors, light fixtures, coat racks and more. Question: Is the tool waterproof? Answer: No. The StudSensor i65 is splash and water resistant, but not waterproof. Question: What is the difference between magnetic and electronic stud finders? Answer: Magnetic stud finders are simply magnets that look for anything magnetic behind a wall. Typically, they are advertised to find screws or nails that hold the wall surface to the studs. However, nails often times are not placed in the center of studs making it difficult to determine where the stud\u2019s center is or how wide the stud is. Electronic stud finders, such as the i65, on the other hand, operate by detecting density changes behind a surface (like a wall) and will clearly and precisely indicate the edges and center of a stud. The center of a stud is the most secure location when mounting anything heavy. For applications like mapping out floor joists electronic stud finders have an advantage over magnets because they are not attracted to nails holding floor boards to a subfloor as well as nails in joists. Question: Does the StudSensor i65 come with a warranty? Answer: The StudSensor i65 comes with a limited one year warranty when fulfilled by and shipped from Amazon.

About Thule Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.

About Thule Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.From the manufacturer Read more AeroSkin Exclusive diamond-textured AeroSkin surface is durable and the aerodynamic shape helps cut through the air.
