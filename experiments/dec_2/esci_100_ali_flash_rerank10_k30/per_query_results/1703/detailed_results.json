The Bamboo Advantage The Shenzhen Knives countertop knife block is made of real bamboo. Traditional harvesting of hardwood trees contributes to deforestation, which starts a vicious cycle of drought and environmental decline and accounts for at least one-fifth of all carbon emissions globally. Bamboo is a grass, and unlike hardwood trees, it regrows after harvesting. After bamboo matures, it can be harvested every single year for the life of the plant. Interestingly, harvesting bamboo to make products is actually greener than not harvesting it. Bamboo culms (the poles) do not live as long as hardwood trees, so when an old culm decays, it releases carbon into the atmosphere. This means that an untouched bamboo forest does not accumulate and store carbon very well. Harvesting the bamboo to make long-lasting products before it starts decaying ensures that the bamboo does not release the stored carbon. Making Things Better Shenzhen products are designed not only to look beautiful in your home, but also to serve a more useful purpose. We listen to your comments and concerns and study our competitors. We always ask \u201cHow can we make it better?\u201d to ensure our products are meticulously planned and designed to work better with your lifestyle. They work more effectively for your tasks so that you don\u2019t have to. Read more The Shenzhen Knives Brand We are a small business based out of Honolulu, Hawaii.

We\u2019re here to help save the fingers and organize! Just any knife organizer won\u2019t solve all your problems. Many designs can leave your knife blades poking out of the blocks at their points or shooting out the back when you close your drawer. Not only is this a hazard for you and your drawer, it can dull your knives over time! Not exactly what we\u2019re looking for in a knife block\u2026 Thankfully, Noble Home & Chef took all of these things into consideration when designing our in-drawer knife block! We have recently (as of 2021) updated our in-drawer knife organizer by deepening the steak knife slots making it much easier to retrieve the knives as well as widening the larger knife slots to accommodate knives with thicker spines. We are constantly innovating our design in response to our customers' suggestions and look forward to continually offering a great customer experience! One of the fastest ways to organize your kitchen drawers is to update that finger-hazard knife drawer with an upscale knife organizer for your drawers! Our 2-story design allows you to store 12 knives in a compact space.

The Bamboo Advantage The Shenzhen Knives countertop knife block is made of real bamboo. Traditional harvesting of hardwood trees contributes to deforestation, which starts a vicious cycle of drought and environmental decline and accounts for at least one-fifth of all carbon emissions globally. Bamboo is a grass, and unlike hardwood trees, it regrows after harvesting. After bamboo matures, it can be harvested every single year for the life of the plant. Interestingly, harvesting bamboo to make products is actually greener than not harvesting it. Bamboo culms (the poles) do not live as long as hardwood trees, so when an old culm decays, it releases carbon into the atmosphere. This means that an untouched bamboo forest does not accumulate and store carbon very well. Harvesting the bamboo to make long-lasting products before it starts decaying ensures that the bamboo does not release the stored carbon. Making Things Better Shenzhen products are designed not only to look beautiful in your home, but also to serve a more useful purpose. We listen to your comments and concerns and study our competitors. We always ask \u201cHow can we make it better?\u201d to ensure our products are meticulously planned and designed to work better with your lifestyle. They work more effectively for your tasks so that you don\u2019t have to. Read more The Shenzhen Knives Brand We are a small business based out of Honolulu, Hawaii.

The Bamboo Advantage The Shenzhen Knives countertop knife block is made of real bamboo. Traditional harvesting of hardwood trees contributes to deforestation, which starts a vicious cycle of drought and environmental decline and accounts for at least one-fifth of all carbon emissions globally. Bamboo is a grass, and unlike hardwood trees, it regrows after harvesting. After bamboo matures, it can be harvested every single year for the life of the plant. Interestingly, harvesting bamboo to make products is actually greener than not harvesting it. Bamboo culms (the poles) do not live as long as hardwood trees, so when an old culm decays, it releases carbon into the atmosphere. This means that an untouched bamboo forest does not accumulate and store carbon very well. Harvesting the bamboo to make long-lasting products before it starts decaying ensures that the bamboo does not release the stored carbon. Making Things Better Shenzhen products are designed not only to look beautiful in your home, but also to serve a more useful purpose. We listen to your comments and concerns and study our competitors. We always ask \u201cHow can we make it better?\u201d to ensure our products are meticulously planned and designed to work better with your lifestyle. They work more effectively for your tasks so that you don\u2019t have to. Read more The Shenzhen Knives Brand We are a small business based out of Honolulu, Hawaii.
