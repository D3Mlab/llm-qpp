Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: what credit score do i need to use va home loan\n\nDocuments:\n\n7121349: In fact, one of the most common questions we receive is: Can I get a VA loan with bad credit? The answer isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t black-and-white, in part because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no clear-cut definition of what \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad credit\u00e2\u0080\u009d actually means. For VA loans, borrowers will often need a FICO credit score of at least 620. But the VA doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mandate a minimum score requirement, and credit score benchmarks can vary by lender. Some lenders may be willing to go below that common 620 cutoff, which is considered by some to be the dividing line between \u00e2\u0080\u009cFair and subprime credit.\n\n5651335: Full mortgage approval can take anywhere from one to five weeks, depending on how complete and organized your paperwork is when submitted to the bank.However, our country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic crisis has resulted in tightened lending guidelines and longer processing and approval time-lines for all loans including VA mortgages.\n\n1416465: If not, you may want to work on your credit before applying for a mortgage. A credit score of 620 or higher is probably the minimum you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need before beginning your property search. Just know that the lower your credit score, the higher your mortgage rate, assuming you are able to qualify at all.\n\n2616163: While it varies by location, FHA loans generally allow borrowers to obtain no more than 96.5 percent financing, which means you can expect to pay 3.5 percent of a home's cost up front.

The state's consumer use tax is the other half of the Virginia retail sales and use tax requirements.ersonal income tax. Virginia's income tax rates are assessed over four tax brackets: 1  2 percent on the first $3,000 of taxable income. 2  3 percent on taxable income between $3,001 and $5,000.\n\n37856: Tax Rates.

Discover can pay off your creditors directly; not all lenders offer that. 3  Want to track their credit score.\n\n6441860: The annual loan limit is $5,500 for undergraduate students and $8,000 for graduate students. The aggregate loan limits are $27,500 for undergraduate students pursuing a bachelor's degree and $60,000 combined for undergraduate/ graduate or professional study.\n\n1617349: The average FICO score in America is 695 and the average Vantage score stands at 673.
