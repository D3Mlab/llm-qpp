Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: mri what to expect\n\nDocuments:\n\n5764285: Tell your doctor and the technologist performing your breast MRI about any metal implants or metal fragments you have in your body. These can cause serious complications when exposed to the MRI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong magnetic pull. People with most pacemakers, for example, cannot have an MRI.owever, patients undergoing breast MRI for a ruptured implant will not need the contrast material. For some people, the contrast material causes allergic reactions. Or, it may cause complications in patients with kidney or liver problems. For these reasons, tell your doctor about any health conditions you may have.\n\n7548961: What to Expect: MRI. MRI machines use a strong magnetic field to produce images of many different structures within the body. For safety reasons, you will be pre-screened during the scheduling process and again prior to your exam by a registered technologist.\n\n5887445: Dear Anne, MRI does not employ radiation to obtain images of the body, so there is no radiation exposure to a person during that test. As Dr. Dauer explains in the Q&A, we do consider alternative tests like MRI for certain cases when appropriate. However, not all imaging gives us the same information.\n\n7637099: How long does the neck mri without dye take - Neck MRI showed several top-normal diam lymph nodes scattered about the left jugulo-digastric chain, most notable at left Level II as well as lymphadenopathy. This is where my doc felt the supraclavicular mass, as he called it. Also, I have been havi Not sure of question.\n\n2571715: The MRI \u00e2\u0080\u0098clearly shows NO CHIARI\u00e2\u0080\u0099, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal CSF flow ventrally around the cerebellar tonsils in the region of the foramen magnum, however there is absent flow dorsally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I have to wait a month before seeing the neurologist and neurosurgeon again.\n\n2175379: Recent advances in MRI have led to a growing interest in optimizing and applying functional MRI methods for assessment of liver disease. These methods include\u00e2\u0080\u0094but are not limited to\u00e2\u0080\u0094diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted MRI, MR elastography (MRE), and MR spectroscopy (MRS).\n\n8417596: X-rays are then taken to see how the dye lines the space in the spinal canal and if there are disc herniations or other lesions. This test may be ordered before performing back surgery. ... Abnormal magnetic-resonance scans of the lumbar spine in asymptomatic subjects.\n\n2595309: Note that the lateral meniscus body is absent reflecting a displaced tear. Fig. 2. Thirty-eight-year-old female with subchondral cyst development. Baseline MRI: T2-weighted sagittal (A) image shows a \u00e2\u0080\u009cflame-shaped\u00e2\u0080\u009d subchondral region of bone marrow edema-like signal in the cephalad aspect of the patella (arrow).\n\n3638232: Why the Test is Performed. A bone scan is used to: 1  Diagnose a bone tumor or cancer. 2  Determine if a cancer that began elsewhere in your body has spread to the bones; common cancers that spread to the bones include breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, and kidney.ow the Test is Performed. A bone scan involves injecting a radioactive material (radiotracer) into a vein. The substance travels through the bloodstream to the bones and organs. As it wears away, it gives off radiation. This radiation is detected by a camera that slowly scans your body.\n\n3146817: I agree with Tony that they probably can only tell so much from the MRI, as far as cranial nerve involvment with the AN. The facial [VII] nerve runs along with auditory and vestibular nerve through a portion of the auditory canal, so this may be why it can be affected more often than the other cranial nerves.\n\n3694087: Another drawback of core needle biopsy is that it may not give full information about the tumor. For example, it can't tell the size of a tumor and sometimes, it can't tell whether a tumor is carcinoma in situ (ductal or lobular) or invasive breast cancer.Taking multiple tissue samples can help limit this problem.he provider will hold the ultrasound device against your breast to see the area. The ultrasound images help the provider guide the biopsy device to the suspicious area. The provider then removes a sample of tissue with the needle in the device. In some centers, this is done with a vacuum assisted device.\n\n6661514: Myoview Stress Test. If your physician is not satisfied with the results of your ECG and Exercise Stress Test, you may need a myoview scan. A small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into your bloodstream at peak exercise. The level of radioactivity used is extremely low and has no side effects.\n\n6194418: Definition. A HIDA scan is an imaging test. It helps to diagnose problems of the gallbladder and liver. Bile is a fluid that is made in the liver. It is stored in the bile duct.This fluid helps your body digest certain foods.If there is a problem with the production or flow of bile, a HIDA scan may find the problem.t helps to diagnose problems of the gallbladder and liver. Bile is a fluid that is made in the liver. It is stored in the bile duct. This fluid helps your body digest certain foods. If there is a problem with the production or flow of bile, a HIDA scan may find the problem.\n\n8398692: The symptoms of cervical radiculopathy may also include pain, numbness, or weakness in different areas of the arm or hand. The spacer between vertebrae called the disc is actually a two-part structure. The circular outer layer, or annulus, is tough and ligament-like and contains the gel-like inner part, or nucleus.\n\n4662035: In the end, there is a lot of difference in chest CT scan costs. According to a 2008 study conducted by the American Hospital Directory, average CT scans cost around $250 to $275, with the total charge coming to about $1,750 (the difference being covered by insurance or similar programs).\n\n7448272: What are the key points of echocardiography? Echocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. This test gives your doctor information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart's chambers and valves are working.\n\n7598572: Brain Tour. 1. Three pounds, three parts. Your brain is your most powerful organ, yet weighs only about three pounds. It has a texture similar to firm jelly. It has three main parts: 1  The cerebrum fills up most of your skull.\n\n4765959: 6 CBCT should only be used when the question for which imaging is required cannot be. answered adequately by lower dose conventional (traditional) radiography. 7 CBCT images must undergo a thorough clinical evaluation (\u00e2\u0080\u0098radiological report\u00e2\u0080\u0099) of the. entire image dataset.\n\n5765637: The California Department of Labor indicates that radiology and medical imaging jobs are expected to grow by 16% over the next six years, which is greater than the national average. There should be an abundance of opportunity for students fresh out of radiology school in CA to find jobs.\n\n1519096: Freebase(4.00 / 1 vote)Rate this definition: Medical diagnosis refers both to the process of attempting to determine or identify a possible disease or disorder, and to the opinion reached by this process. From the point of view of statistics the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests.\n\n4091625: In brief: 7-15 mmHg. The normal intracranial pressure in an adult lying on their side is 7-15 mmhg, although pain and lying in a tightly contracted position can drive this up even in healthy people. In brief: 7-15 mmHg.\n\n459507: Since then, only 258 of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 7,569 hospitals have received the honor, and only one in Maryland\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Johns Hopkins Hospital, which applied for and received the designation in 2003. This year, the Hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Magnet status is up for review.\n\n3464924: Arranges patients for radiological examinations. Produces radiographs (x-rays) to aid in the diagnosis of medical problems. Prevents patient from being exposed to unnecessary radiation.

These can cause serious complications when exposed to the MRI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong magnetic pull. People with most pacemakers, for example, cannot have an MRI.owever, patients undergoing breast MRI for a ruptured implant will not need the contrast material. For some people, the contrast material causes allergic reactions. Or, it may cause complications in patients with kidney or liver problems. For these reasons, tell your doctor about any health conditions you may have.\n\n7548961: What to Expect: MRI. MRI machines use a strong magnetic field to produce images of many different structures within the body. For safety reasons, you will be pre-screened during the scheduling process and again prior to your exam by a registered technologist.\n\n5887445: Dear Anne, MRI does not employ radiation to obtain images of the body, so there is no radiation exposure to a person during that test. As Dr. Dauer explains in the Q&A, we do consider alternative tests like MRI for certain cases when appropriate. However, not all imaging gives us the same information.\n\n7637099: How long does the neck mri without dye take - Neck MRI showed several top-normal diam lymph nodes scattered about the left jugulo-digastric chain, most notable at left Level II as well as lymphadenopathy. This is where my doc felt the supraclavicular mass, as he called it. Also, I have been havi Not sure of question.\n\n2571715: The MRI \u00e2\u0080\u0098clearly shows NO CHIARI\u00e2\u0080\u0099, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal CSF flow ventrally around the cerebellar tonsils in the region of the foramen magnum, however there is absent flow dorsally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I have to wait a month before seeing the neurologist and neurosurgeon again.\n\n2175379: Recent advances in MRI have led to a growing interest in optimizing and applying functional MRI methods for assessment of liver disease. These methods include\u00e2\u0080\u0094but are not limited to\u00e2\u0080\u0094diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted MRI, MR elastography (MRE), and MR spectroscopy (MRS).\n\n8417596: X-rays are then taken to see how the dye lines the space in the spinal canal and if there are disc herniations or other lesions. This test may be ordered before performing back surgery. ... Abnormal magnetic-resonance scans of the lumbar spine in asymptomatic subjects.\n\n2595309: Note that the lateral meniscus body is absent reflecting a displaced tear. Fig. 2.

A bone scan is used to: 1  Diagnose a bone tumor or cancer. 2  Determine if a cancer that began elsewhere in your body has spread to the bones; common cancers that spread to the bones include breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, and kidney.ow the Test is Performed. A bone scan involves injecting a radioactive material (radiotracer) into a vein. The substance travels through the bloodstream to the bones and organs. As it wears away, it gives off radiation. This radiation is detected by a camera that slowly scans your body.\n\n3146817: I agree with Tony that they probably can only tell so much from the MRI, as far as cranial nerve involvment with the AN. The facial [VII] nerve runs along with auditory and vestibular nerve through a portion of the auditory canal, so this may be why it can be affected more often than the other cranial nerves.\n\n3694087: Another drawback of core needle biopsy is that it may not give full information about the tumor. For example, it can't tell the size of a tumor and sometimes, it can't tell whether a tumor is carcinoma in situ (ductal or lobular) or invasive breast cancer.Taking multiple tissue samples can help limit this problem.he provider will hold the ultrasound device against your breast to see the area. The ultrasound images help the provider guide the biopsy device to the suspicious area. The provider then removes a sample of tissue with the needle in the device. In some centers, this is done with a vacuum assisted device.\n\n6661514: Myoview Stress Test. If your physician is not satisfied with the results of your ECG and Exercise Stress Test, you may need a myoview scan. A small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into your bloodstream at peak exercise. The level of radioactivity used is extremely low and has no side effects.\n\n6194418: Definition. A HIDA scan is an imaging test. It helps to diagnose problems of the gallbladder and liver. Bile is a fluid that is made in the liver. It is stored in the bile duct.This fluid helps your body digest certain foods.If there is a problem with the production or flow of bile, a HIDA scan may find the problem.t helps to diagnose problems of the gallbladder and liver.

If there is a problem with the production or flow of bile, a HIDA scan may find the problem.\n\n8398692: The symptoms of cervical radiculopathy may also include pain, numbness, or weakness in different areas of the arm or hand. The spacer between vertebrae called the disc is actually a two-part structure. The circular outer layer, or annulus, is tough and ligament-like and contains the gel-like inner part, or nucleus.\n\n4662035: In the end, there is a lot of difference in chest CT scan costs. According to a 2008 study conducted by the American Hospital Directory, average CT scans cost around $250 to $275, with the total charge coming to about $1,750 (the difference being covered by insurance or similar programs).\n\n7448272: What are the key points of echocardiography? Echocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. This test gives your doctor information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart's chambers and valves are working.\n\n7598572: Brain Tour. 1. Three pounds, three parts. Your brain is your most powerful organ, yet weighs only about three pounds. It has a texture similar to firm jelly.
