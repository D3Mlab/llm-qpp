Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: is celsius measured in degrees\n\nDocuments:\n\n7468560: A degree can be defined as a set change in temperature measured against a given scale, for example, one degree Celsius is one hundredth of the temperature change between the point at which water starts to change state from solid to liquid state and the point at which it starts to change from its gaseous state to liquid.\n\n4980039: The temperature reads from 200\u00c2\u00ba to 400\u00c2\u00ba Fahrenheit and is perfect for testing hot oil and sugar syrups. Armed with these two tools, the following guide to temperature should get you cooking to the right degree. Testing Your Thermometer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Accuracy. Test your thermometer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accuracy by placing it in boiling water. At sea level, it should read 212\u00c2\u00b0F.\n\n8486961: The answer is 60. We assume you are converting between degree and 1/6 circle. You can view more details on each measurement unit: degree or 1/6 circle. The SI derived unit for angle is the radian. 1 radian is equal to 57.2957795131 degree, or 0.954929658551 1/6 circle. Note that rounding errors may occur, so always check the results. Use this page to learn how to convert between degrees and 1/6 circle. Type in your own numbers in the form to convert the units!\n\n1493343: A dog's normal ear temperature is between 100\u00c2\u00b0 to 103\u00c2\u00b0F. Note that ear thermometers are generally more expensive than rectal thermometers and, if not used properly, are less accurate. When to contact your vet. Any time a dog's temperature falls below 99\u00c2\u00b0F or rises above 103\u00c2\u00b0F, you should contact your veterinarian.hen used properly, ear thermometers are a reliable and less invasive way to take your dog's temperature. An ear thermometer works by measuring infrared heat waves that are emitted from the dog's eardrum area. Be sure to place the thermometer deep into the horizontal ear canal to obtain an accurate reading.\n\n5895670: Most commonly, a thermometer. Related Information: Thermometers are used to measure the increase or decrease in the temperature of a system as it gains or loses internal energy. An alcohol-in-glass thermometer has been the most common personal instrument used to measure temperature.Mercury thermometers are still around but are no longer offered for sale.here are many devices which help to measure temperature, it is simply a method of measuring temperature to a scale. In early days it is measured by Fahrenheit scale. Temperature can be measured by various types of thermometer as Thermocouples, Thermistors, Pyrometer. a cooking thermometer.\n\n8547919: 83%. The measurements for the sea temperature in Cartagena, Murcia are provided by the daily satellite readings provided by the NOAA. The temperatures given are the surface temperature (SST) which is most relevant to recreational users.\n\n2318060: 1 calorie of heat is the amount needed to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree Centigrade. 1 calorie (cal) = 4.184 J. (The Calories in food ratings are actually kilocalories.) A BTU (British Thermal Unit) is the amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of water by 1 degree Farenheit (F).\n\n6216995: Room Temperature. 28 pages on this wiki. Room Temperature (RT) is generally defined as the ambient air temperature in whatever environment being used for a given procedure. More specifically, it is defined as 20-25\u00c2\u00b0C (68-77\u00c2\u00b0F), as some ambient temperatures, by nature, do not fall within this range.oom Temperature. 28 pages on this wiki.

More specifically, it is defined as 20-25\u00c2\u00b0C (68-77\u00c2\u00b0F), as some ambient temperatures, by nature, do not fall within this range.\n\n2615133: Room temperature is basically the temperature of the room....as you probably know. But if you are trying to figure out the average room temperature that you would use for....say a science project....Its about 65degrees Fahrenheit to 78degrees Fahrenheit. Room temperature is 78 degrees Fahrenheit. The term 'room temperature' is an important matter in different sectors of science like Physics, Chemistry & even in Biology. But it is most important in chemistry. It is the base of standard temperature & pressure (STP). It is 25 degree celcius or 298 kelvin.\n\n4664904: Pluto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distance from the Sun results in a broad range of temperatures on the surface, although it still remains incredibly cold by Earth standards. In fact, the surface temperature of Pluto is so cold that scientists use the Kelvin scale to measure it.luto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distance from the Sun results in a broad range of temperatures on the surface, although it still remains incredibly cold by Earth standards. In fact, the surface temperature of Pluto is so cold that scientists use the Kelvin scale to measure it.\n\n5447485: C to F: Multiply the temperature by 2 and then add 30. (actual formula is multiply by 1.8, add 32) ex: 22 C is roughly equal to 74 degrees using my method, actual conversion is 71.6. F to C: Now just work it backwards, subtract 30 from the temp. and then divide by 2.\n\n5101396: A digital thermometer only takes about a minute to get a reading. 1  If available, use a probe cover with your thermometer. 2  Place the thermometer under the side of your child's tongue until the thermometer beeps. 3  Remember that cold or hot drinks, smoking or chewing gum can change oral temperature. If available, use a probe cover with your thermometer. 2  Put the end of the thermometer in the center of your child's armpit. 3  Be sure the thermometer is only between skin and that clothes are not in the way. 4  Bring your child's arm down, close to the side.\n\n3962591: The Three Degrees performed the song at Prince Charles ' 30th birthday party at Buckingham Palace in 1978. Sheila Ferguson recalled that the song was played to me by Kenny Gamble at the piano in 1973 and I threw a tantrum. I screamed and yelled and said I would never sing it.\n\n3801342: 34\u00c2\u00b0F - 40\u00c2\u00b0F is the ideal refrigerator temperature range. Some Web sites just say under 40\u00c2\u00b0F, but not so cold to freeze fresh foods. Dairy products and meats keep best at the low end of the temperature range.A freezer should be set at 0\u00c2\u00b0F, or lower, if possible.If the temperature gets warmer than +5\u00c2\u00b0F, ice cream will be too soft and won't keep well. A properly working food freezer will operate in the range of -10\u00c2\u00b0F to +2\u00c2\u00b0F, and may go up to around +8\u00c2\u00b0F briefly during the defrost cycle if it is of the frost free type.4\u00c2\u00b0F - 40\u00c2\u00b0F is the ideal refrigerator temperature range. Some Web sites just say under 40\u00c2\u00b0F, but not so cold to freeze fresh foods. Dairy products and meats keep best at the low end of the temperature range.\n\n6257433: It is non-invasive test that involves no radiation. Thermography is based on two ideas: 1  Because cancer cells are growing and multiplying very fast, blood flow and metabolism are higher in a cancer tumor. 2  As blood flow and metabolism increase, skin temperature goes up.\n\n151979: Temporal artery temperature is not affected by the things that cause oral and underarm temperatures to be misleading. For example, drinking, coughing, talking, or mouth breathing can easily affect oral temperature, and skin blood flow changes with a fever can easily affect axillary temperature.\n\n3311076: We assume you are converting between hour and day.
