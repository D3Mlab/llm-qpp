The Andean Condor lives in the Andes mountains. It is also found along the Pacific coast of South America. They tend to nest very high up\u00e2\u0080\u0093 about 16,000 feet from the ground. They tend to nest on ledges that make it very hard for predators to reach them.\n\n5904448: They are found throughout Central and South America. In North America, however, hunting has reduced their range to isolated areas in Mexico, western U.S. wilderness areas, southern Florida and southwestern Canada, according to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Unlike other cats, pumas do not live in packs. They live by themselves in large territories, which they mark using urine or feces. Pumas are solitary creatures for good reason. They need hunting room to find enough food to live. Only a few pumas can live in a 30-square-mile (78 square kilometers) radius.\n\n1024472: 1 New York is a temperate area where there are plants such as oak trees and animals such as squirrels, pigeons, and deer. 2  Desert which is hot and dry. 3  Cactus and grasses grow in the desert and animals such as scorpions, vultures, and diamond-headed snakes live there.

The North Rim has a short season.\n\n1543192: In the middle of the Gurbant\u00c3\u00bcngg\u00c3\u00bct Desert, this pole is arid and filled with sand dunes. The nearest community is found to the south \u00c3\u009cr\u00c3\u00bcmqi, with a population of nearly 3 million. Like other poles of inaccessibility, however, this location is often contested as not being the farthest from the coast because of the Gulf of Orb.\n\n8039825: Pipa pipa are aquatic omnivores. They eat worms, insects, crustaceans, and small fishes. They lack tongues and use the long, sensitive fingers of their forelimbs to search for food on the bottoms of ponds.\n\n3884858: 27 Jun, 2013 where do 0.
