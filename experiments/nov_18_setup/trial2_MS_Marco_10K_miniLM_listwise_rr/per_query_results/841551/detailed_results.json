Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: what is the proper name for a cartilage cell?\n\nDocuments:\n\n7771731: The extracellular matrix of cartilage is secreted by chondroblasts, (chondro = cartilage), which are found in the outer covering layer of cartilage. As the chondroblasts secrete matrix and fibres, they become trapped inside it, and mature into cells called chondrocytes.\n\n5114668: The bones at a synovial joint are covered by a membrane of hyaline cartilage. This cartilage, also known as articular cartilage serves a function as shock-absorber and also, along with the secretion of synovial fluid in the membrane, helps reduce friction.he synovial membrane secretes synovial fluid that lubricates the articular surfaces of the joint. In some joints, the synovial membrane extends outside the joint capsule to form a bursa.\n\n8710617: There are three types of cartilage: 1  Hyaline-most common, found in the ribs, nose, larynx, trachea. 2  Fibro-is found in invertebral discs, joint capsules, ligaments. 3  Elastic-is found in the external ear, epiglottis and larynx.\n\n2134946: Single layer of columnar cells varying in heights that appears multilayered, all cells connect to basement membrane. Secretion & movement of mucin by ciliary action. Ciliated version lines most of the respiratory tract, nasal cavity, part of pharynx, trachea & bronchipharynx, trachea & bronchi.\n\n5088188: The knee joint capsule is a sac that encloses the knee joint cavity. It is attached to the bones of the joint, and forms the joint cavity. The knee joint capsule has a tough, fibrous outer membrane and an inner synovial membrane, which produces joint fluid (synovial fluid) that lubricates the joint and nourishes the articular cartilage that coats the ends of the bones in the joint.\n\n1413561: It is generally regarded as a noninflammatory condition of articular cartilage resulting from natural aging, trauma, or disease. Many names have been applied to the condition; however, osteoarthritis and degenerative joint disease are two of the most common and will be used interchangeably in this chapter.\n\n2937056: Lesson Summary. Trabeculae are thin columns and plates of bone that create a spongy structure in cancellous bone, which is located at the ends of long bones, and in the pelvis, ribs, skull, and vertebrae.one tissue is formed by cells called osteoblasts and is secreted in rings called lamellae that expand outward as the trabeculae get larger. As new tissue grows around the osteoblast, a hard ceramic material called calcium phosphate begins to surround the cell.\n\n1095563: Mast Cell Tumor (Mastocytoma) in Dogs. Mast cells are cells that reside in the connective tissues, especially those vessels and nerves that are closest to the external surfaces (e.g., skin, lungs, nose, mouth).\n\n2508283: A cell in the blood of vertebrates that transports oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the tissues. In mammals, the red blood cell is disk-shaped and biconcave, contains hemoglobin, and lacks a nucleus. Also called erythrocyte, red cell, red corpuscle.\n\n5355715: Osteoblast: A cell that makes bone. It does so by producing a matrix that then becomes mineralized. Bone mass is maintained by a balance between the activity of osteoblasts that form bone and other cells called osteoclasts that break it down.\n\n2832768: There is also choroid plexus in the fourth ventricle, in the section closest to the bottom half of the cerebellum. The choroid plexus consists of many capillaries, separated from the ventricles by choroid epithelial cells. Fluid filters through these cells from blood to become cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n3466727: Like the enthesis the sacroiliac joint is lined by fibrocartilage. The opposing surfaces of the sacroiliac joint are not smooth and uniform but irregular or incongruous which limits movement at that site. A detailed anatomy of the joint is shown at the bottom of this page.\n\n7230805: Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Animal Cell - Parts. 1  Cell Membrane: The cell membrane is a fluid mosaic structure which is composed of a phospholipid bilayer and other important macromolecules such as proteins. The cell membrane separates the cell from the environment and allows the movement of materials in and out of the cell.\n\n1566068: mast cell tumor. a benign, local aggregation of mast cells forming a nodular tumor that occurs in the skin of most species, but most commonly in dogs. The release of histamine or other vasoactive substances may be associated with gastroduodenal ulceration. These tumors may become malignant.\n\n8084533: Many kinds of prokaryotes and eukaryotes contain a structure outside the cell membrane called the cell wall. With only a few exceptions, all prokaryotes have thick, rigid cell walls that give them their shape. Among the eukaryotes, some protists, and all fungi and plants, have cell walls.\n\n2595309: Note that the lateral meniscus body is absent reflecting a displaced tear. Fig. 2. Thirty-eight-year-old female with subchondral cyst development. Baseline MRI: T2-weighted sagittal (A) image shows a \u00e2\u0080\u009cflame-shaped\u00e2\u0080\u009d subchondral region of bone marrow edema-like signal in the cephalad aspect of the patella (arrow).\n\n6394628: Zycal Bioceuticals is the manufacturer of the bone-strengthening supplement Ostinol. Each tablet contains bone-stimulating proteins, which include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and partially hydrolyzed collagen.The manufacturer alleges that this unique blend encourages the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cells to grow new bone and cartilage in a process called osteoinduction.Ostinol is the first type of supplementation to contain BMPs and a specialized form of collagen.This product has undergone 20 years of clinical use and 40 years of research.s comprised of partially hydrolyzed collagen and bone morphogenetic proteins. The manufacturer alleges that this product has undergone 20 years of clinical studies and 40 years of research, but there is no further content provided to back up its alleges.\n\n959168: The proximal tubule is the portion of the duct system of the nephron of the kidney which leads from Bowman's capsule to the loop of Henle.he proximal tubule as a part of the nephron can be divided into two sections, pars convoluta and pars recta. Differences in cell outlines exist between these segments, and therefore presumably in function too.\n\n8592220: Zygote, fertilized egg cell that results from the union of a female gamete (egg, or ovum) with a male gamete (sperm). In the embryonic development of humans and other animals, the zygote stage is brief and is followed by cleavage, when the single cell becomes subdivided into smaller cells. zoom_in. Fertilized egg of the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides, the causative agent of ascariasis, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6CDC/Dr.\n\n775934: By extension a cell may be called haploid if its nucleus is haploid, and an organism may be called haploid if its body cells (somatic cells) are haploid. The number of chromosomes in a single set is called the haploid number, given the symbol n.\n\n7196963: Best Answer: decomposer ... I'm pretty sure that's called a decomposer(it breaks down dead organisms with the enzymes they produce). Hope I helped ... Saprophyte ...\n\n4289051: A tendon is a type of fibrous tissue that connects your muscles to your bones. These tissues help control actions such as running, jumping, grasping, and lifting. Without tendons, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to control the movement of your body. A protective sheath known as the synovium covers tendons.\n\n5956340: Ligaments and Tendons. There are several important ligaments in the shoulder. Ligaments are soft tissue structures that connect bones to bones. A joint capsule is a watertight sac that surrounds a joint. In the shoulder, the joint capsule is formed by a group of ligaments that connect the humerus to the glenoid.\n\n7877887: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Systemic chondromalacia or Atrophic polychondritis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a rare disorder that causes inflammation of the connective tissue, specifically the cartilage surrounding the eyes, nose, and ears.mong the main symptoms of relapsing polychondritis includes pain that occurs suddenly around the ears, nose, and eyes, as well as the joints and tissues. Inflammation is another common symptom that causes stiffness, or arthritis, in the hands and feet, wrists, knees, and ankles.\n\n6072738: Split and merge into it. Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. The calotte is an antiquated term. The correct term is calvaria and it is typically composed of portions of the frontal, parietal and occipital bones, but may also include parts of the temporal and sphenoid bones.plit and merge into it.

Transitional epithelium is a layer of cells that form the mucosal lining of your ureters, a portion of your urethra, and your urinary bladder. The cells are stratified, which means they create several layers.These cells provide protection and allow the vessels to expand to accommodate fluid.xpansion. Another reason why transitional epithelium is stratified is so that the tissue can stretch. When your bladder is empty the tissue is relaxed, resulting in the interior surface forming many finger-like folds of the muscle and mucosal layer.\n\n4202581: Mitosis is the division of cells that produces daughter cells that have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

Also called erythrocyte, red cell, red corpuscle.\n\n5355715: Osteoblast: A cell that makes bone. It does so by producing a matrix that then becomes mineralized. Bone mass is maintained by a balance between the activity of osteoblasts that form bone and other cells called osteoclasts that break it down.\n\n2832768: There is also choroid plexus in the fourth ventricle, in the section closest to the bottom half of the cerebellum. The choroid plexus consists of many capillaries, separated from the ventricles by choroid epithelial cells. Fluid filters through these cells from blood to become cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n3466727: Like the enthesis the sacroiliac joint is lined by fibrocartilage. The opposing surfaces of the sacroiliac joint are not smooth and uniform but irregular or incongruous which limits movement at that site. A detailed anatomy of the joint is shown at the bottom of this page.\n\n7230805: Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Animal Cell - Parts. 1  Cell Membrane: The cell membrane is a fluid mosaic structure which is composed of a phospholipid bilayer and other important macromolecules such as proteins.

Transitional epithelium is a layer of cells that form the mucosal lining of your ureters, a portion of your urethra, and your urinary bladder. The cells are stratified, which means they create several layers.These cells provide protection and allow the vessels to expand to accommodate fluid.xpansion. Another reason why transitional epithelium is stratified is so that the tissue can stretch. When your bladder is empty the tissue is relaxed, resulting in the interior surface forming many finger-like folds of the muscle and mucosal layer.\n\n4202581: Mitosis is the division of cells that produces daughter cells that have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Hence, it occurs when your body is growing and to replace those worn out cells.\n\n4288294: When a cell is not progressing to mitosis, it remains in phase G0 (G zero). Therefore, the cell cycle is divided into two major phases: interphase and mitosis. Interphase includes the phases (or stages) G1, S and G2 whereas mitosis is subdivided into prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase.\n\n3702008: It is formed by the humerus -- upper arm bone -- and the glenoid fossa -- part of the shoulder blade bone.

Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic processes which all living cells use to produce energy in the form of ATP. In cellular respiration, the cell breaks down glucose to produce large amounts of energy in the form of ATP.Cellular respiration can take two paths: aerobic respiration or anaerobic respiration.TP is the energy currency of all cells. Most of the reactions in the cell require ATP. ATP is energy rich. When the energy is used by a reaction, ATP breaks up into ADP and Pi. In order to use the energy again, ADP and Pi must be changed back into ATP. This requires energy.\n\n6114449: The fluid of the chloroplast surrounding the thylakoid membrane; involved in the synthesis of organ ic molecule s from carbon dioxide and water. stroma tolite ... stroma The matrix surrounding the grana in the inner membrane of chloroplasts.

The base of the hair follicle is a bulb-shaped structure called the hair bulb. This includes several layers of different types of cells that extend up through the hair follicle, an indentation called the papilla (of the hair) - see below, and a region of cells called the germinal matrix.10.air follicles are the structures from which hairs emerge from the skin. Each hair is a thread of fused (i.e. attached together), dead, keratinized cells. The two main parts of hairs are: 1  The hair shaft is the visible part of the hair that protrudes through the skin.\n\n5366912: Learn more about the the Trachea (human Respiratory System). This human anatomy lecture has been made by Wendy Riggs, for the College of the Redwoods. The trachea, colloquially called windpipe, is a tube that connects the pharynx and larynx to the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in all air-breathing animals with lungs.\n\n1219252: Hydrocele Treatment. Most hydroceles resolve without medical treatment. However, if the condition causes discomfort or becomes very large, treatment may be necessary. There are two methods of treatment: aspiration and hydrocelectomy (surgery). In aspiration, a needle is used to drain the fluid.\n\n6282611: There are also certain organelles found in plant cells that are not found in animal cells and vice versa.

This oxygen is released and distributed as the RBCs move through the capillaries into tissues and organs. If hemoglobin is low tissues will not receive enough oxygen causing poor healing and can create an excess workload on the heart. Red blood cells are produced by the bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 120 days. An RBC count that is too high or too low can both cause health problems.\n\n5662914: The thin walls also aid diffusion, as diffusion is most effective over short distances. The capillaries are relative small vessels, with a diameter of only 7um (micrometres), and the diameter of the capillaries is approximately the same as that of a Red blood cell.\n\n7939043: In Plasmodium, for instance, the sporozoites are cells that develop in the mosquito's salivary glands, leave the mosquito during a blood meal, and enter liver cells (hepatocytes), where they multiply. Cells infected with sporozoites eventually burst, releasing merozoites into the bloodstream. Sporozoites are motile and they move by gliding.

Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: what is the proper name for a cartilage cell?\n\nDocuments:\n\n7771731: The extracellular matrix of cartilage is secreted by chondroblasts, (chondro = cartilage), which are found in the outer covering layer of cartilage. As the chondroblasts secrete matrix and fibres, they become trapped inside it, and mature into cells called chondrocytes.\n\n5114668: The bones at a synovial joint are covered by a membrane of hyaline cartilage. This cartilage, also known as articular cartilage serves a function as shock-absorber and also, along with the secretion of synovial fluid in the membrane, helps reduce friction.he synovial membrane secretes synovial fluid that lubricates the articular surfaces of the joint. In some joints, the synovial membrane extends outside the joint capsule to form a bursa.\n\n8710617: There are three types of cartilage: 1  Hyaline-most common, found in the ribs, nose, larynx, trachea. 2  Fibro-is found in invertebral discs, joint capsules, ligaments. 3  Elastic-is found in the external ear, epiglottis and larynx.\n\n2134946: Single layer of columnar cells varying in heights that appears multilayered, all cells connect to basement membrane. Secretion & movement of mucin by ciliary action. Ciliated version lines most of the respiratory tract, nasal cavity, part of pharynx, trachea & bronchipharynx, trachea & bronchi.\n\n5088188: The knee joint capsule is a sac that encloses the knee joint cavity. It is attached to the bones of the joint, and forms the joint cavity. The knee joint capsule has a tough, fibrous outer membrane and an inner synovial membrane, which produces joint fluid (synovial fluid) that lubricates the joint and nourishes the articular cartilage that coats the ends of the bones in the joint.\n\n1413561: It is generally regarded as a noninflammatory condition of articular cartilage resulting from natural aging, trauma, or disease. Many names have been applied to the condition; however, osteoarthritis and degenerative joint disease are two of the most common and will be used interchangeably in this chapter.\n\n2937056: Lesson Summary. Trabeculae are thin columns and plates of bone that create a spongy structure in cancellous bone, which is located at the ends of long bones, and in the pelvis, ribs, skull, and vertebrae.one tissue is formed by cells called osteoblasts and is secreted in rings called lamellae that expand outward as the trabeculae get larger. As new tissue grows around the osteoblast, a hard ceramic material called calcium phosphate begins to surround the cell.\n\n1095563: Mast Cell Tumor (Mastocytoma) in Dogs. Mast cells are cells that reside in the connective tissues, especially those vessels and nerves that are closest to the external surfaces (e.g., skin, lungs, nose, mouth).\n\n2508283: A cell in the blood of vertebrates that transports oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the tissues. In mammals, the red blood cell is disk-shaped and biconcave, contains hemoglobin, and lacks a nucleus. Also called erythrocyte, red cell, red corpuscle.\n\n5355715: Osteoblast: A cell that makes bone. It does so by producing a matrix that then becomes mineralized. Bone mass is maintained by a balance between the activity of osteoblasts that form bone and other cells called osteoclasts that break it down.\n\n2832768: There is also choroid plexus in the fourth ventricle, in the section closest to the bottom half of the cerebellum. The choroid plexus consists of many capillaries, separated from the ventricles by choroid epithelial cells. Fluid filters through these cells from blood to become cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n3466727: Like the enthesis the sacroiliac joint is lined by fibrocartilage. The opposing surfaces of the sacroiliac joint are not smooth and uniform but irregular or incongruous which limits movement at that site. A detailed anatomy of the joint is shown at the bottom of this page.\n\n7230805: Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Animal Cell - Parts. 1  Cell Membrane: The cell membrane is a fluid mosaic structure which is composed of a phospholipid bilayer and other important macromolecules such as proteins. The cell membrane separates the cell from the environment and allows the movement of materials in and out of the cell.\n\n1566068: mast cell tumor. a benign, local aggregation of mast cells forming a nodular tumor that occurs in the skin of most species, but most commonly in dogs. The release of histamine or other vasoactive substances may be associated with gastroduodenal ulceration. These tumors may become malignant.\n\n8084533: Many kinds of prokaryotes and eukaryotes contain a structure outside the cell membrane called the cell wall. With only a few exceptions, all prokaryotes have thick, rigid cell walls that give them their shape. Among the eukaryotes, some protists, and all fungi and plants, have cell walls.\n\n2595309: Note that the lateral meniscus body is absent reflecting a displaced tear. Fig. 2. Thirty-eight-year-old female with subchondral cyst development. Baseline MRI: T2-weighted sagittal (A) image shows a \u00e2\u0080\u009cflame-shaped\u00e2\u0080\u009d subchondral region of bone marrow edema-like signal in the cephalad aspect of the patella (arrow).\n\n6394628: Zycal Bioceuticals is the manufacturer of the bone-strengthening supplement Ostinol. Each tablet contains bone-stimulating proteins, which include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and partially hydrolyzed collagen.The manufacturer alleges that this unique blend encourages the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cells to grow new bone and cartilage in a process called osteoinduction.Ostinol is the first type of supplementation to contain BMPs and a specialized form of collagen.This product has undergone 20 years of clinical use and 40 years of research.s comprised of partially hydrolyzed collagen and bone morphogenetic proteins. The manufacturer alleges that this product has undergone 20 years of clinical studies and 40 years of research, but there is no further content provided to back up its alleges.\n\n959168: The proximal tubule is the portion of the duct system of the nephron of the kidney which leads from Bowman's capsule to the loop of Henle.he proximal tubule as a part of the nephron can be divided into two sections, pars convoluta and pars recta. Differences in cell outlines exist between these segments, and therefore presumably in function too.\n\n8592220: Zygote, fertilized egg cell that results from the union of a female gamete (egg, or ovum) with a male gamete (sperm). In the embryonic development of humans and other animals, the zygote stage is brief and is followed by cleavage, when the single cell becomes subdivided into smaller cells. zoom_in.
