        "Return the best ordering of the documents below given the query. Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: how are air masses named\n\nDocuments:\n\n7979836: Best Answer: Air masses are named from where they originated. Air masses are known as Arctic, Polar, Tropical, or Equatorial. They are named as either maritime or continental. Maritime a moist air mass and continental is a dry air mass. It's named on where it's from. Usually by their source region.\n\n2130506: The scientific name for a hurricane, regardless of its location, is tropical cyclone. In general, a cyclone is a large system of spinning air that rotates around a point of low pressure. Only tropical cyclones, which have warm air at their center, become the powerful storms that are called hurricanes.\n\n2421481: As of 2006, the star with the highest known absolute magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of \u00e2\u0088\u009214.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the NGC 6397 cluster.n a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere is the thin chromosphere region, where spicules appear and stellar flares begin. This is surrounded by a transition region, where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only 100 km (62 mi).\n\n669003: Dry air is composed primarily of nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen comprise approximately 99 percent of the atmosphere. The other gases are present in minute amounts, each of them equaling less than 1 percent.\n\n1193779: Notes. 1  Order refers to the position among other moons with respect to their average distance from Neptune. 2  Label refers to the Roman numeral attributed to each moon in order of their discovery. 3  Diameters with multiple entries such as 60\u00c3\u009740\u00c3\u009734 are for bodies that are not spherical.\n\n4832744: Pressure, or the amount of force per unit of area, is the key. The Earth is covered with a layer of air 80 miles thick. Like any type of matter, the gases in air have mass, and since Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gravity pulls this mass down onto the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface, the air produces a force called atmospheric pressure.\n\n5825805: : any of several simple gaseous compounds that contain carbon, chlorine, fluorine, and sometimes hydrogen, that are used as refrigerants, cleaning solvents, and aerosol propellants and in the manufacture of plastic foams, and that are believed to be a major cause of stratospheric ozone depletion \u00e2\u0080\u0094abbreviation CFC. a gas that was once commonly used in various products (such as aerosols) but that is believed to cause damage to the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n2837338: Air pressure is related to its density, which is related to the air's temperature and height above the Earth's surface. (Related: Understanding air density). Air pressure changes with the weather. In fact, it's one of the most important factors that determines what the weather is like.\n\n442187: A meteor, known colloquially as a shooting star or falling star, is the passage of a meteoroid, micrometeoroid, comet or asteroid into the Earth's atmosphere, heated from collisions with air particles in the upper atmosphere and shedding glowing material in its wake sufficiently to create a visible streak of light. meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic body travelling through space. Meteoroids are significantly smaller than asteroids, and range in size from small grains to 1 meter-wide objects.\n\n8181000: The constellation is best known for its annual Perseid meteor shower. It is also home to the famous variable star Algol, Beta Persei. Perseus also contains a number of famous deep sky objects, among them Messier 34, the Double Cluster, the California Nebula (NGC 1499) and the Little Dumbbell Nebula (Messier 76).\n\n4337018: Firstly, the rare atoms and molecules of air here are warmed by solar radiation. An energised atom is a fast moving atom; a fast moving atom is a hot atom. The second question is answered by the fact that there is virtually nothing there. The thermosphere is a fine approximation to a vacuum.\n\n6560418: As a result, they rarely form within 5\u00c2\u00b0 of the equator. Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 4,000 km (62 and 2,485 mi) in diameter. Tropical refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over tropical seas.\n\n7977281: The maximum mass of a white dwarf, about 1.4 solar masses. A white dwarf of greater mass cannot support itself and will collapse. A star cluster containing 100,000 to 1 million stars in a sphere about 75 ly in diameter that is generally old, metal-poor, and found in the spherical component of a galaxy.\n\n1530636: Abdominal bloating occurs when the abdomen fills with air or gas. This may cause the area to appear larger. The abdomen may feel hard or tight to the touch. The condition can cause discomfort and pain. Abdominal pain is pain that originates between the chest and the pelvis.\n\n5019615: T236 Answer Pages Earth Science: Geology, the Environment, and the Universe Teaching Transparency Masters Name Class Date 1.Name and describe the orbital shape expressed in Kepler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first law. The orbit is an ellipse, which is an oval shape centered on two points instead of one, as in a circle. 2.\n\n3432824: Aries (\u00e2\u0099\u0088) /\u00cb\u0088\u00c9\u009b\u00c9\u0099ri\u00cb\u0090z/ (meaning ram) is the first astrological sign in the zodiac, spanning the first 30 degrees of celestial longitude (0\u00c2\u00b0\u00e2\u0089\u00a4 \u00ce\u00bb <30\u00c2\u00b0). Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this sign mostly between March 21 and April 19 each year.\n\n2433868: Total ozone. Total ozone at any location on the globe is defined as the sum of all the ozone in the atmosphere directly above that location. Most ozone resides in the stratospheric ozone layer and a small percentage (about 10%) is distributed throughout the troposphere.tratospheric ozone is formed naturally by chemical reactions involving solar ultraviolet radiation (sunlight) and oxygen molecules, which make up 21% of the atmosphere. In the first step, solar ultraviolet radiation breaks apart one oxygen molecule (O2) to produce two oxygen atoms (2 O) (see Figure Q2-1).\n\n7081772: The \u00e2\u0080\u009cA0\u00e2\u0080\u009d signifies its temperature, whereas the \u00e2\u0080\u009cV\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a measure of energy output (luminosity), indicating that Vega is a normal star (not a giant). \u00e2\u0080\u009cMain sequence\u00e2\u0080\u009d again testifies to the fact that it belongs in the category of normal stars, and that it produces energy through stable fusion of hydrogen into helium.\n\n8766084: Density of (Gas) In commercial applications where air is the gas, its density is at 70\u00c2\u00ba Fahrenheit and 29.92 inches of mercury (barometric pressure), and the. airflow is not compressed (under 10 IN w.c.), the formula reduces to: Air Velocity (FPM) = 4005 x Velocity Pressure (IN w.c.)\n\n1875798: Austin /aus-tin/ [2 sylls.] as a boys' name (also used less commonly as girls' name Austin) is pronounced AW-sten. It is of French and Latin origin, and the meaning of Austin is great, magnificient.Variant and oral form of Augustine, contracted by everyday speech.Enjoyed some popularity in England as late as the 17th century.Now most often a surname used as a given name.

During World War I, Rotary in Britain increased from 9 to 22 clubs, and other early international branches were Cuba in 1916 and India in 1920.\n\n3526127: A grain is a unit of measurement of mass, and, for the troy grain, equal to exactly 7001647989100000000\u00e2\u0099\u00a064.79891 milligrams. It is nominally based upon the mass of a single seed of a cereal. From the Bronze Age into the Renaissance the average masses of wheat and barley grains were part of the legal definitions of units of mass.\n\n2465724: Why Heavier Things Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Fall Faster. Galileo and his research assistants, Galileo Galileo and Figaro. Galileo is not just one of the Italian-sounding words found in the lyrics of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBohemian Rhapsody\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n8197618: Phoenix - Astronomy and space exploration. 1  EADS Phoenix, a prototype launch vehicle. 2  Phoenix Cluster, a galaxy cluster. 3  Phoenix (constellation) Phoenix (Chinese astronomy) 4  Phoenix Dwarf, a galaxy. 5  Phoenix (spacecraft), a NASA mission to Mars. 6  Project Phoenix (SETI), a search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\n873130: For Earth, atmospheric entry occurs above the K\u00c3\u00a1rm\u00c3\u00a1n line at an altitude of more than 100 km (62 mi.) above the surface, while at Venus atmospheric entry occurs at 250 km (155 mi.) and at Mars atmospheric entry at about 80 km (50 mi.).\n\n5951237: Precipitation happens when so much water vapor condenses that the air cannot hold it anymore. The clouds get so heavy that some of the water must fall back down to Earth as rain, snow, sleet or hail. There are many different types of clouds.\n\n"

Air masses are known as Arctic, Polar, Tropical, or Equatorial. They are named as either maritime or continental. Maritime a moist air mass and continental is a dry air mass. It's named on where it's from. Usually by their source region.\n\n2130506: The scientific name for a hurricane, regardless of its location, is tropical cyclone. In general, a cyclone is a large system of spinning air that rotates around a point of low pressure. Only tropical cyclones, which have warm air at their center, become the powerful storms that are called hurricanes.\n\n2421481: As of 2006, the star with the highest known absolute magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of \u00e2\u0088\u009214.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the NGC 6397 cluster.n a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere is the thin chromosphere region, where spicules appear and stellar flares begin. This is surrounded by a transition region, where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only 100 km (62 mi).\n\n669003: Dry air is composed primarily of nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen comprise approximately 99 percent of the atmosphere. The other gases are present in minute amounts, each of them equaling less than 1 percent.\n\n1193779: Notes. 1  Order refers to the position among other moons with respect to their average distance from Neptune. 2  Label refers to the Roman numeral attributed to each moon in order of their discovery. 3  Diameters with multiple entries such as 60\u00c3\u009740\u00c3\u009734 are for bodies that are not spherical.\n\n4832744: Pressure, or the amount of force per unit of area, is the key. The Earth is covered with a layer of air 80 miles thick. Like any type of matter, the gases in air have mass, and since Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gravity pulls this mass down onto the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface, the air produces a force called atmospheric pressure.\n\n5825805: : any of several simple gaseous compounds that contain carbon, chlorine, fluorine, and sometimes hydrogen, that are used as refrigerants, cleaning solvents, and aerosol propellants and in the manufacture of plastic foams, and that are believed to be a major cause of stratospheric ozone depletion \u00e2\u0080\u0094abbreviation CFC. a gas that was once commonly used in various products (such as aerosols) but that is believed to cause damage to the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n2837338: Air pressure is related to its density, which is related to the air's temperature and height above the Earth's surface. (Related: Understanding air density). Air pressure changes with the weather. In fact, it's one of the most important factors that determines what the weather is like.\n\n442187: A meteor, known colloquially as a shooting star or falling star, is the passage of a meteoroid, micrometeoroid, comet or asteroid into the Earth's atmosphere, heated from collisions with air particles in the upper atmosphere and shedding glowing material in its wake sufficiently to create a visible streak of light. meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic body travelling through space. Meteoroids are significantly smaller than asteroids, and range in size from small grains to 1 meter-wide objects.\n\n8181000: The constellation is best known for its annual Perseid meteor shower. It is also home to the famous variable star Algol, Beta Persei. Perseus also contains a number of famous deep sky objects, among them Messier 34, the Double Cluster, the California Nebula (NGC 1499) and the Little Dumbbell Nebula (Messier 76).\n\n4337018: Firstly, the rare atoms and molecules of air here are warmed by solar radiation. An energised atom is a fast moving atom; a fast moving atom is a hot atom. The second question is answered by the fact that there is virtually nothing there. The thermosphere is a fine approximation to a vacuum.\n\n6560418: As a result, they rarely form within 5\u00c2\u00b0 of the equator. Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 4,000 km (62 and 2,485 mi) in diameter. Tropical refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over tropical seas.\n\n7977281: The maximum mass of a white dwarf, about 1.4 solar masses. A white dwarf of greater mass cannot support itself and will collapse. A star cluster containing 100,000 to 1 million stars in a sphere about 75 ly in diameter that is generally old, metal-poor, and found in the spherical component of a galaxy.\n\n1530636: Abdominal bloating occurs when the abdomen fills with air or gas. This may cause the area to appear larger. The abdomen may feel hard or tight to the touch. The condition can cause discomfort and pain. Abdominal pain is pain that originates between the chest and the pelvis.\n\n5019615: T236 Answer Pages Earth Science: Geology, the Environment, and the Universe Teaching Transparency Masters Name Class Date 1.Name and describe the orbital shape expressed in Kepler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first law.

Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this sign mostly between March 21 and April 19 each year.\n\n2433868: Total ozone. Total ozone at any location on the globe is defined as the sum of all the ozone in the atmosphere directly above that location. Most ozone resides in the stratospheric ozone layer and a small percentage (about 10%) is distributed throughout the troposphere.tratospheric ozone is formed naturally by chemical reactions involving solar ultraviolet radiation (sunlight) and oxygen molecules, which make up 21% of the atmosphere. In the first step, solar ultraviolet radiation breaks apart one oxygen molecule (O2) to produce two oxygen atoms (2 O) (see Figure Q2-1).\n\n7081772: The \u00e2\u0080\u009cA0\u00e2\u0080\u009d signifies its temperature, whereas the \u00e2\u0080\u009cV\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a measure of energy output (luminosity), indicating that Vega is a normal star (not a giant). \u00e2\u0080\u009cMain sequence\u00e2\u0080\u009d again testifies to the fact that it belongs in the category of normal stars, and that it produces energy through stable fusion of hydrogen into helium.\n\n8766084: Density of (Gas) In commercial applications where air is the gas, its density is at 70\u00c2\u00ba Fahrenheit and 29.92 inches of mercury (barometric pressure), and the. airflow is not compressed (under 10 IN w.c.), the formula reduces to: Air Velocity (FPM) = 4005 x Velocity Pressure (IN w.c.)\n\n1875798: Austin /aus-tin/ [2 sylls.] as a boys' name (also used less commonly as girls' name Austin) is pronounced AW-sten.

This human anatomy lecture has been made by Wendy Riggs, for the College of the Redwoods. The trachea, colloquially called windpipe, is a tube that connects the pharynx and larynx to the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in all air-breathing animals with lungs.\n\n7578546: Condensation is the opposite of evaporation. It takes place when water vapor in the air condenses from a gas, back into a liquid form, and leaves the atmosphere, returning to the surface of the Earth. Usually in order for condensation to take place, the atmosphere must be fully saturated. In other words, the maximum vapor pressure must have been reached.\n\n1933059: The Specific Gravity of liquids and solids is defined as a dimensionless unit which is the ratio of density of a material to the density of water at a given temperature, where density is defined as the material\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mass per unit volume and is measured in kg/m 3.\n\n1572808: While the polar and subtropical jet streams are the best known and most studied, other jet streams can form when wind speeds are above 58 mph (93.3 kph) in the upper atmosphere at about 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) to 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) above the surface.\n\n7241710: For many years, incandescent bulbs were filled with nitrogen gas. When argon became more affordable, it was substituted for nitrogen because it decreased the rate of evaporation of the tungsten filament and increased bulb life. More recently, krypton or xenon are used in some bulbs in place of argon. Because the molecular size is larger than argon, both these inert gases do a better job of retarding the evaporation of the filament and give longer life to the bulb.\n\n4661630: Relative Density or RD is also known as Specific Gravity or SG.RD is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a given referance material.SG means RD with resp \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ect to water.The term RD is often preferred in modern scientific usage.6 people found this useful.
