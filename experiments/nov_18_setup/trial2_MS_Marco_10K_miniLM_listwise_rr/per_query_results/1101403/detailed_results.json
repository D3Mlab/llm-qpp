A primary headache is caused by overactivity of or problems with pain-sensitive structures in your head. A primary headache isn't a symptom of an underlying disease. Chemical activity in your brain, the nerves or blood vessels surrounding your skull, or the muscles of your head and neck (or some combination of these factors) can play a role in primary headaches.\n\n7899050: Whatever your cause \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you have a new onset of headache you must see your own doctor. The lists of location of headache seem bewildering. In most cases, people with problem headaches will have one of 5 common causes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Migraine, Tension-Type Headache, Cervicogenic Headache, Cluster Headache and Ice-pick Headache. Your first step is to know that you are safe. After that you take steps to control your headache using the Headache Friendly Lifestyle\u00e2\u0084\u00a2.\n\n7242815: Occipital Neuralgia headaches are caused by damage or injury to the nerves located at the base of the skull. Sharp, stabbing pain in the left temple of the head can be accompanied by sensitivity to light and to touch. Initial treatment includes rest, over-the-counter pain pills, and a heating pad on the neck.\n\n1730227: Spinal headaches are caused by leakage of spinal fluid through a puncture hole in the tough membrane (dura mater) that surrounds the spinal cord. This leakage decreases the pressure exerted by the spinal fluid on the brain and spinal cord, which leads to a headache. Spinal headaches typically appear within 48 hours after a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia.\n\n3146817: I agree with Tony that they probably can only tell so much from the MRI, as far as cranial nerve involvment with the AN. The facial [VII] nerve runs along with auditory and vestibular nerve through a portion of the auditory canal, so this may be why it can be affected more often than the other cranial nerves.\n\n8795536: Dizziness, Headache and Hearing loss. WebMD Symptom Checker helps you find the most common medical conditions indicated by the symptoms dizziness, headache and hearing loss including Middle ear infection, Labyrinthitis, and Hearing loss. There are 97 conditions associated with dizziness, headache and hearing loss. The links below will provide you with more detailed information on these medical conditions from the WebMD Symptom Checker and help provide a better understanding of causes and treatment of these related conditions.\n\n8526468: Epigastric pain: Rare Types. Rare types of medical conditions and diseases in related medical categories: 1  Chronic Digestive Disorders -- Rare Types: 2  Crohn's Disease -- Rare Types. 3  Ulcerative Colitis -- Rare Types. 4  Celiac Disease -- Rare Types. 5  Inflammatory Bowel Disease -- Rare Types. 6  Irritable Bowel Syndrome -- Rare Types.\n\n8490669: Types of Intracranial Hemorrhages (Brain Bleeds) and Their Causes. I. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) and Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH) Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the second most commonly detected neonatal brain bleed and is caused by rupture of veins in the space or spaces near the skull.\n\n3696103: There are three main types of ear infections. Each has a different combination of symptoms. Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common ear infection. Parts of the middle ear are infected and swollen and fluid is trapped behind the eardrum. This causes pain in the ear\u00e2\u0080\u0094commonly called an earache. Your child might also have a fever. Otitis media with effusion (OME) sometimes happens after an ear infection has run its course and fluid stays trapped behind the eardrum.\n\n8611582: In a small study in Headache, two groups of migraine patients were randomly assigned to three months of yoga therapy or self care. Compared with the control group, the yoga participants had less frequent and less painful attacks, as well as less anxiety.\n\n2097711: Severe dengue initially presents with the common symptoms of dengue fever such as fever, intense headache, aches and pains, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, skin rashes and leukopenia (reduction in white blood cells). A positive tourniquet test is also a sign of dengue fever.evere dengue may also occur when a person who has developed immunity to one strain of the virus becomes infected with another strain. There are four different strains of the dengue virus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 DEN 1, 2, 3, 4. In 2013, in Singapore, over 50 per cent of dengue fever cases were due to the DEN-1 virus strain.\n\n5724734: Call your doctor if: 1  Your symptoms last more than 10 days. 2  You have a high fever. 3  Your nasal discharge is yellow or green and is accompanied by sinus pain or fever.  You have blood in your nasal discharge or a persistent clear discharge after a head injury.\n\n8496567: Lavender: Everyone knows of those times, when you get those tension headaches because of work stress. This is the perfect opportunity to try some Lavender Tea. Lavender is known for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abilities to reduce nervous exhaustion, headaches caused by stress, and anxiety. It also perfect for reducing indigestion problems.\n\n346073: if symptoms are present they may include one or more of the following bumps sores or warts near the mouth anus penis or vagina swelling or redness near the penis or vagina skin rash painful urination weight loss loose stools night sweats aches pains fever and chills yellowing of the skin jaundice\n\n3402829: 1 Migraine headaches, which are painful, debilitating headaches that often occur with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, noise, and smell.  Decreased blood flow through the arteries that supply blood to the base of the brain (vertebrobasilar insufficiency).\n\n4560178: Throbbing headaches are often associated with migraine headaches, caffeine withdrawal, and hangovers. However, you may also feel a throbbing headache with a wide variety of other conditions, such as a stress headache, cluster headache, or inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis).\n\n2571715: The MRI \u00e2\u0080\u0098clearly shows NO CHIARI\u00e2\u0080\u0099, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal CSF flow ventrally around the cerebellar tonsils in the region of the foramen magnum, however there is absent flow dorsally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I have to wait a month before seeing the neurologist and neurosurgeon again.\n\n2437106: 5 doctors agreed: 1  Days...: Headaches after a concussion can last several days and in more severe concussions, weeks.

Do not delay! ...Read more.\n\n6620972: Signs and symptoms. Often, a patient who develops HELLP syndrome has already been followed up for gestational hypertension, or is suspected to develop pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and proteinuria). Up to 8% of all cases present after delivery. There is gradual but marked onset of headaches (30%), blurred vision, malaise (90%), nausea/vomiting (30%), band pain around the upper abdomen (65%) and tingling in the extremities. Oedema may occur but its absence does not exclude HELLP syndrome. Arterial hypertension is a diagnostic requirement, but may be mild. Rupture of the liver capsule and a resultant hematoma may occur. If the patient gets a seizure or coma, the condition has progressed into full-blown eclampsia.\n\n5712739: A. Your physician has not been paying attention to the prescribing information or the scientific literature. Muscle pain is one of the most common complaints we hear from people taking statins. It can manifest as neck pain, back pain, leg pain, muscle fatigue and leg cramps. An article in the Archives of Internal Medicine (online, Dec. 12, 2011) titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cNocturnal Leg Cramps and Prescription Use That Precedes Them\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted that:\n\n6398025: The symptoms of the muscle spasm may feel different depending on which muscle in the body is affected. For example, a spasm in the cervical musculature may be interpreted as a headache, and a spasm in the pectorals or chest muscle can be interpreted as a tightness or deep chest pain.\n\n5544524: Beyond sharp and/or chronic jaw pain, sufferers may also experience symptoms such as jaw clicks (particularly when eating), muscle fatigue in the face, a locked jaw, ear pain, and headaches.

A primary headache is caused by overactivity of or problems with pain-sensitive structures in your head. A primary headache isn't a symptom of an underlying disease. Chemical activity in your brain, the nerves or blood vessels surrounding your skull, or the muscles of your head and neck (or some combination of these factors) can play a role in primary headaches.\n\n7899050: Whatever your cause \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you have a new onset of headache you must see your own doctor. The lists of location of headache seem bewildering. In most cases, people with problem headaches will have one of 5 common causes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Migraine, Tension-Type Headache, Cervicogenic Headache, Cluster Headache and Ice-pick Headache. Your first step is to know that you are safe. After that you take steps to control your headache using the Headache Friendly Lifestyle\u00e2\u0084\u00a2.\n\n7242815: Occipital Neuralgia headaches are caused by damage or injury to the nerves located at the base of the skull. Sharp, stabbing pain in the left temple of the head can be accompanied by sensitivity to light and to touch. Initial treatment includes rest, over-the-counter pain pills, and a heating pad on the neck.\n\n1730227: Spinal headaches are caused by leakage of spinal fluid through a puncture hole in the tough membrane (dura mater) that surrounds the spinal cord. This leakage decreases the pressure exerted by the spinal fluid on the brain and spinal cord, which leads to a headache. Spinal headaches typically appear within 48 hours after a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia.\n\n3146817: I agree with Tony that they probably can only tell so much from the MRI, as far as cranial nerve involvment with the AN.

A primary headache is caused by overactivity of or problems with pain-sensitive structures in your head. A primary headache isn't a symptom of an underlying disease. Chemical activity in your brain, the nerves or blood vessels surrounding your skull, or the muscles of your head and neck (or some combination of these factors) can play a role in primary headaches.\n\n7899050: Whatever your cause \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you have a new onset of headache you must see your own doctor. The lists of location of headache seem bewildering. In most cases, people with problem headaches will have one of 5 common causes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Migraine, Tension-Type Headache, Cervicogenic Headache, Cluster Headache and Ice-pick Headache. Your first step is to know that you are safe. After that you take steps to control your headache using the Headache Friendly Lifestyle\u00e2\u0084\u00a2.\n\n7242815: Occipital Neuralgia headaches are caused by damage or injury to the nerves located at the base of the skull. Sharp, stabbing pain in the left temple of the head can be accompanied by sensitivity to light and to touch. Initial treatment includes rest, over-the-counter pain pills, and a heating pad on the neck.\n\n1730227: Spinal headaches are caused by leakage of spinal fluid through a puncture hole in the tough membrane (dura mater) that surrounds the spinal cord. This leakage decreases the pressure exerted by the spinal fluid on the brain and spinal cord, which leads to a headache. Spinal headaches typically appear within 48 hours after a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia.\n\n3146817: I agree with Tony that they probably can only tell so much from the MRI, as far as cranial nerve involvment with the AN. The facial [VII] nerve runs along with auditory and vestibular nerve through a portion of the auditory canal, so this may be why it can be affected more often than the other cranial nerves.\n\n8795536: Dizziness, Headache and Hearing loss. WebMD Symptom Checker helps you find the most common medical conditions indicated by the symptoms dizziness, headache and hearing loss including Middle ear infection, Labyrinthitis, and Hearing loss. There are 97 conditions associated with dizziness, headache and hearing loss. The links below will provide you with more detailed information on these medical conditions from the WebMD Symptom Checker and help provide a better understanding of causes and treatment of these related conditions.\n\n8526468: Epigastric pain: Rare Types. Rare types of medical conditions and diseases in related medical categories: 1  Chronic Digestive Disorders -- Rare Types: 2  Crohn's Disease -- Rare Types. 3  Ulcerative Colitis -- Rare Types. 4  Celiac Disease -- Rare Types. 5  Inflammatory Bowel Disease -- Rare Types. 6  Irritable Bowel Syndrome -- Rare Types.\n\n8490669: Types of Intracranial Hemorrhages (Brain Bleeds) and Their Causes. I. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) and Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH) Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the second most commonly detected neonatal brain bleed and is caused by rupture of veins in the space or spaces near the skull.\n\n3696103: There are three main types of ear infections. Each has a different combination of symptoms. Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common ear infection. Parts of the middle ear are infected and swollen and fluid is trapped behind the eardrum. This causes pain in the ear\u00e2\u0080\u0094commonly called an earache. Your child might also have a fever. Otitis media with effusion (OME) sometimes happens after an ear infection has run its course and fluid stays trapped behind the eardrum.\n\n8611582: In a small study in Headache, two groups of migraine patients were randomly assigned to three months of yoga therapy or self care. Compared with the control group, the yoga participants had less frequent and less painful attacks, as well as less anxiety.\n\n2097711: Severe dengue initially presents with the common symptoms of dengue fever such as fever, intense headache, aches and pains, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, skin rashes and leukopenia (reduction in white blood cells). A positive tourniquet test is also a sign of dengue fever.evere dengue may also occur when a person who has developed immunity to one strain of the virus becomes infected with another strain. There are four different strains of the dengue virus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 DEN 1, 2, 3, 4. In 2013, in Singapore, over 50 per cent of dengue fever cases were due to the DEN-1 virus strain.\n\n5724734: Call your doctor if: 1  Your symptoms last more than 10 days. 2  You have a high fever. 3  Your nasal discharge is yellow or green and is accompanied by sinus pain or fever.  You have blood in your nasal discharge or a persistent clear discharge after a head injury.\n\n8496567: Lavender: Everyone knows of those times, when you get those tension headaches because of work stress. This is the perfect opportunity to try some Lavender Tea. Lavender is known for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abilities to reduce nervous exhaustion, headaches caused by stress, and anxiety. It also perfect for reducing indigestion problems.\n\n346073: if symptoms are present they may include one or more of the following bumps sores or warts near the mouth anus penis or vagina swelling or redness near the penis or vagina skin rash painful urination weight loss loose stools night sweats aches pains fever and chills yellowing of the skin jaundice\n\n3402829: 1 Migraine headaches, which are painful, debilitating headaches that often occur with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, noise, and smell.  Decreased blood flow through the arteries that supply blood to the base of the brain (vertebrobasilar insufficiency).\n\n4560178: Throbbing headaches are often associated with migraine headaches, caffeine withdrawal, and hangovers. However, you may also feel a throbbing headache with a wide variety of other conditions, such as a stress headache, cluster headache, or inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis).\n\n2571715: The MRI \u00e2\u0080\u0098clearly shows NO CHIARI\u00e2\u0080\u0099, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal CSF flow ventrally around the cerebellar tonsils in the region of the foramen magnum, however there is absent flow dorsally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I have to wait a month before seeing the neurologist and neurosurgeon again.\n\n2437106: 5 doctors agreed: 1  Days...: Headaches after a concussion can last several days and in more severe concussions, weeks. If you are having headaches after a head injury see your primary care physician.Other diagnoses including bleeds adjacent to the brain and the brain lining( dura) need to be ruled out . Do not delay! ...Read more.\n\n6620972: Signs and symptoms. Often, a patient who develops HELLP syndrome has already been followed up for gestational hypertension, or is suspected to develop pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and proteinuria). Up to 8% of all cases present after delivery. There is gradual but marked onset of headaches (30%), blurred vision, malaise (90%), nausea/vomiting (30%), band pain around the upper abdomen (65%) and tingling in the extremities. Oedema may occur but its absence does not exclude HELLP syndrome. Arterial hypertension is a diagnostic requirement, but may be mild. Rupture of the liver capsule and a resultant hematoma may occur. If the patient gets a seizure or coma, the condition has progressed into full-blown eclampsia.\n\n5712739: A. Your physician has not been paying attention to the prescribing information or the scientific literature. Muscle pain is one of the most common complaints we hear from people taking statins. It can manifest as neck pain, back pain, leg pain, muscle fatigue and leg cramps.
