Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: what is male puberty\n\nDocuments:\n\n7815910: Puberty is what happens in children's bodies that changes them into adults. After puberty, people are able to make children. A girl who has gone through puberty can become pregnant and have a baby. At puberty, a boy's body begins making sperm and he starts to be able to ejaculate, which is semen coming out from his penis when he is sexually excited.\n\n8562381: A female dog, (bitch) can begin puberty around 6 months of age. If she has not had her first heat, or cycle, by 12 months of age, talk to your vet.The bitch will typically come into heat twice a year after her first heat. female dog, (bitch) can begin puberty around 6 months of age. If she has not had her first heat, or cycle, by 12 months of age, talk to your vet.\n\n3127754: If testosterone deficiency occurs before or during puberty, signs and symptoms are likely to include: 1  Delayed puberty 2  : Lack of development of the testes and lack of growth of the penis. 3  Lack of pubic and facial hair. 4  Failure of the voice to break.\n\n5946850: As I understand it, it can take 7-10 years to become fully grown, depending on the environment, feeding, etc. They are considered an adult at 1 year of age, which is about 4 inches (10.1 cm). 12 cm for a 3 year old is a bit on the small side, I would expect a male at that age to be closer to 14 cm if not more.You should expect a male to reach 18-23 cm or more when full grown, a female 25-30.5 cm. JAX.osted: Tue Dec 15, 2009 11:52 pm. Technically, they're considered to be hatchlings until one year of age, then juveniles, later followed by sub-adults and adults (I think there's a phase in between there somewhere), so adulthood would be reached at about 5 years of age.\n\n5204734: 1. Look thicker, sturdier stalks with fewer leaves on male plants. A male plant, compared to a female plant of the same strain, generally has a thicker stalk. That is because it gets taller than female plants and needs to be able to support the weight.arijuana plants can grow both sex organs. If you see any of the tell-tale male buds, you should trim them like you would a normal male plant. They will still release pollen that can ruin your crop.  1 Hermies are generally undesirable plants, and they can ruin a small crop with their pollen if you're not careful.\n\n6804294: Of female dogs with mammary tumors, 50.9% have malignant tumors. Risk factors for mammary neoplasia in female dogs include age, breed (Table 1), and sexually intact status. Multiple studies have documented that spaying bitches when young greatly decreases their risk of developing mammary neoplasia when aged.enign prostatic hypertrophy/prostatitisBenign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is age-related change in prostate size. By 6 years of age, 75 to 80% of intact male dogs will have evidence of BPH; by 9 years of age, 95 to 100% of intact male dogs will have evidence of BPH.\n\n8536153: men have breast tissue as well as women but cannot nurse the forming of nipples occurs before the sex organs as part of fetal development we all start out as female and the mothers body either releases hormones to cause a male to develop or notnfortunately your nipples grow to the size they are however you can stretch them rub some vaseline into them and gently pull on them with your thumbs and forefingers\n\n2412181: The sex hormones: testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone. The hormones commonly considered to be sex hormones in the body are testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone. Testosterone is often referred to as a male hormone, and estrogen and progesterone are often referred to as female hormones.\n\n816585: For the female prostate gland, see Skene's gland. For the prostrate body position, see Prostration. The prostate (from Ancient Greek \u00cf\u0080\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0083\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00ac\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b7\u00cf\u0082, prostates, literally one who stands before, protector, guardian) is a compound tubuloalveolar exocrine gland of the male reproductive system in most mammals. It differs considerably among species anatomically, chemically, and physiologically.\n\n3008501: The Prostate Gland. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that forms part of the male reproductive system. The gland is made of two lobes, or regions, enclosed by an outer layer of tissue. As the diagrams show, the prostate is located in front of the rectum and just below the bladder, where urine is stored.\n\n5796766: The follicular phase is the phase of the estrous cycle, (or, in humans and great apes, the menstrual cycle) during which follicles in the ovary mature. It ends with ovulation. The main hormone controlling this stage is estradiol.[1]\n\n8638144: Hebephilia is the strong and persistent adult sexual interest in pubescent (early adolescent) individuals, typically ages 11\u00e2\u0080\u009314 (see the Tanner stage).\n\n3249074: This is the most common type of hernia. Males are more likely to have inguinal hernias, as they have a small tunnel in the tissues of their groins which occurred when they were developing as a baby. This tunnel allowed the testicles (testes) to come down from the tummy (abdomen) into the scrotum.\n\n8577346: Mammals and Drosophila females have two X chromosomes: XX males have one X chromosome and one Y: XY These are the  sex chromosomes , all other chromosomes are called  autosomes . The sex with two different chromosomes is the heterogametic sex. The other is the homogametic sex. For the X chromosome then, female mammals and Drosophila have two copies of each gene on the X, but males have only one. Females can be homozygous or heterozygous, but males are hemizygous.\n\n3475605: 1 If height is very short, some doctors may recommend an androgen called oxandrolone (Oxandrin) in addition to the growth hormone.  Estrogen therapy. Most girls with Turner syndrome need to start estrogen and related hormone therapy in order to begin puberty and achieve adult sexual development. Estrogen may also help your daughter grow when used along with growth hormone.\n\n1271095: But premenstrual UTIs are not a super common PMS type symptom. If frequent urination is a symptom that arrives before menstruation every month here are some possible explanations. Often, before flow, women will retain fluid (eg bloating/water weight gain). Around the time of flow any extra fluid will be excreted via the kidneys. Other women will have an increase in irritable bladder symptoms---frequent urination triggers by contraction of the bladder.\n\n2106240: Fibroids are non-cancerous (benign) tumors that grow from the muscle layers of the uterus (womb) . They are also known as uterine fibroids, myomas, or fibromyomas. The singular of uterine fibroids is Uterine Fibroma.Fibroids are growths of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue.ibroids are non-cancerous (benign) tumors that grow from the muscle layers of the uterus (womb) . They are also known as uterine fibroids, myomas, or fibromyomas. The singular of uterine fibroids is Uterine Fibroma.\n\n8022156: Prostate secretion is called semen. It is a fluid with a milky appearance and helps to nourish and carry the sperm via penis (from testicles) during ejaculation. Prostatic secretion actually mixes with semen. The secretion liquefies the semen to allow it move through the penis during ejaculation.\n\n7904868: At the top of the graph is the boys age and to the right is the weight in kilograms (or pounds). The thicker red line in the middle is the 50th percentile, (or the average weight if you prefer), which indicates that 50% of the population of boys has a weight that is heavier than the line, and 50% of boys are lighter.\n\n7530661: The testes are known as gonads. Their female counterpart are the ovaries. In addition to their role in the male reproductive system, the testes also have the distinction of being an endocrine gland because they secrete testosterone\u00e2\u0080\u0094a hormone that is vital to the normal development of male physical characteristics.\n\n4021235: During the first three stages, the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality develops as the source of its libido moves around its body and different impulses come to bear from the parents. Problems at any stage of development can result in the child getting fixated (stuck) at a stage.\n\n3990886: What is a meningioma? A meningioma is a type of tumor that develops from the meninges, the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.

Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: what is male puberty\n\nDocuments:\n\n7815910: Puberty is what happens in children's bodies that changes them into adults. After puberty, people are able to make children. A girl who has gone through puberty can become pregnant and have a baby. At puberty, a boy's body begins making sperm and he starts to be able to ejaculate, which is semen coming out from his penis when he is sexually excited.\n\n8562381: A female dog, (bitch) can begin puberty around 6 months of age. If she has not had her first heat, or cycle, by 12 months of age, talk to your vet.The bitch will typically come into heat twice a year after her first heat. female dog, (bitch) can begin puberty around 6 months of age. If she has not had her first heat, or cycle, by 12 months of age, talk to your vet.\n\n3127754: If testosterone deficiency occurs before or during puberty, signs and symptoms are likely to include: 1  Delayed puberty 2  : Lack of development of the testes and lack of growth of the penis. 3  Lack of pubic and facial hair. 4  Failure of the voice to break.\n\n5946850: As I understand it, it can take 7-10 years to become fully grown, depending on the environment, feeding, etc. They are considered an adult at 1 year of age, which is about 4 inches (10.1 cm). 12 cm for a 3 year old is a bit on the small side, I would expect a male at that age to be closer to 14 cm if not more.You should expect a male to reach 18-23 cm or more when full grown, a female 25-30.5 cm. JAX.osted: Tue Dec 15, 2009 11:52 pm. Technically, they're considered to be hatchlings until one year of age, then juveniles, later followed by sub-adults and adults (I think there's a phase in between there somewhere), so adulthood would be reached at about 5 years of age.\n\n5204734: 1. Look thicker, sturdier stalks with fewer leaves on male plants. A male plant, compared to a female plant of the same strain, generally has a thicker stalk. That is because it gets taller than female plants and needs to be able to support the weight.arijuana plants can grow both sex organs. If you see any of the tell-tale male buds, you should trim them like you would a normal male plant. They will still release pollen that can ruin your crop.  1 Hermies are generally undesirable plants, and they can ruin a small crop with their pollen if you're not careful.\n\n6804294: Of female dogs with mammary tumors, 50.9% have malignant tumors. Risk factors for mammary neoplasia in female dogs include age, breed (Table 1), and sexually intact status. Multiple studies have documented that spaying bitches when young greatly decreases their risk of developing mammary neoplasia when aged.enign prostatic hypertrophy/prostatitisBenign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is age-related change in prostate size. By 6 years of age, 75 to 80% of intact male dogs will have evidence of BPH; by 9 years of age, 95 to 100% of intact male dogs will have evidence of BPH.\n\n8536153: men have breast tissue as well as women but cannot nurse the forming of nipples occurs before the sex organs as part of fetal development we all start out as female and the mothers body either releases hormones to cause a male to develop or notnfortunately your nipples grow to the size they are however you can stretch them rub some vaseline into them and gently pull on them with your thumbs and forefingers\n\n2412181: The sex hormones: testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone. The hormones commonly considered to be sex hormones in the body are testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone. Testosterone is often referred to as a male hormone, and estrogen and progesterone are often referred to as female hormones.\n\n816585: For the female prostate gland, see Skene's gland. For the prostrate body position, see Prostration. The prostate (from Ancient Greek \u00cf\u0080\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0083\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00ac\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b7\u00cf\u0082, prostates, literally one who stands before, protector, guardian) is a compound tubuloalveolar exocrine gland of the male reproductive system in most mammals. It differs considerably among species anatomically, chemically, and physiologically.\n\n3008501: The Prostate Gland. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that forms part of the male reproductive system. The gland is made of two lobes, or regions, enclosed by an outer layer of tissue.
