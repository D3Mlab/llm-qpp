Cortisol output by your adrenal glands is one of the most reliable indicators of your adrenal function and how well your body is dealing with stress. The Cortisol/DHEAS Saliva Test measures the levels of the stress hormones DHEAS and cortisol in your saliva, and provides an evaluation of how cortisol levels differ throughout the day.\n\n7842676: I was put back on a dose of prednisone just above where I first developed symptoms of insufficiency (~15 mg).

But your situation, a female about 65, is a very typical age and sex group for having thin skin. I am afraid it is a part of your aging process.\n\n"

Now lets talk about herbs. This is my area of expertise.
