AD 127-145, Alexandria), ancient astronomer, geographer, and mathematician who considered the Earth the center of the universe (the Ptolemaic system). Virtually nothing is known about his life.\n\n4049587: For reference, our own asteroid belt lies at about 3 astronomical units from the sun, and Uranus is roughly 19 astronomical units away. One of the two possible planets previously identified around Epsilon Eridani, called Epsilon Eridani b, was discovered in 2000. The planet is thought to orbit at an average distance of 3.4 astronomical units from the star -- just outside the innermost asteroid belt identified by Spitzer. This is the first time that an asteroid belt and a planet beyond our solar system have been found in a similar arrangement as our asteroid belt and Jupiter. Some researchers had reported that Epsilon Eridani b orbits in an exaggerated ellipse ranging between 1 and 5 astronomical units, but this means the planet would cross, and quickly disrupt, the newfound asteroid belt.\n\n4051918: Definition of astronomy for English Language Learners. : the scientific study of stars, planets, and other objects in outer space.\n\n5316461: At the same time, Galileo worked with pendulums. In his life, accurate timekeeping was virtually nonexistent. Galileo observed, however, that the steady motion of a pendulum could improve this. In 1602, he determined that the time it takes a pendulum to swing back and forth does not depend on the arc of the swing.talian astronomer Galileo Galilei provided a number of scientific insights that laid the foundation for future scientists. His investigation of the laws of motion and improvements on the telescope helped further the understanding of the world and universe around him.\n\n5539081: The planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distance from the Sun also varies as it orbits. In fact, the Earth is never the same distance from the Sun from day to day. When the Earth is closest to the Sun, it is said to be at perihelion. This occurs around January 3rd each year, when the Earth is at a distance of about 147,098,074 km.he planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distance from the Sun also varies as it orbits.

The orbit is an ellipse, which is an oval shape centered on two points instead of one, as in a circle. 2.\n\n8312250: Earth's Location in the Universe by Azcolvin429 29 March 2012 (UTC) - Own work. Astronomers use a coordinate system from the perspective of our planet in relation to a perceived celestial sphere. We can refer to coordinates in the sphere based on our view of the universe.\n\n2664061: A rotation about an external point, e.g. the Earth about the Sun, is called a revolution or orbital revolution, typically when it is produced by gravity.otation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the x axis, followed by a rotation around the y axis, and followed by a rotation around the z axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.\n\n7293945: Sputnik I, launched on October 4, 1957, was the first man-made object to successfully achieve Earth orbit. It was followed by Sputnik II on Sputnik 2, on November 3, 1957.\n\n3197706: \u00c2\u00b7 just now. 1  It's not, particularly. 2  Earth is just what people thought up of calling our planet. 3  Earth means 'SOIL'. 4  because it'smade of earth, i do geo 4 i know what im saying. 5  It originated from the 8th century word Erda which means ground or soil.\n\n2421481: As of 2006, the star with the highest known absolute magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of \u00e2\u0088\u009214.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the NGC 6397 cluster.n a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere is the thin chromosphere region, where spicules appear and stellar flares begin. This is surrounded by a transition region, where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only 100 km (62 mi).\n\n5055769: The crew of STS-125 included three astronauts who had previous experience servicing Hubble. Scott Altman visited Hubble in 2002 as commander of STS-109, the fourth Hubble servicing mission. John Grunsfeld, an astronomer, has serviced Hubble twice, performing a total of five spacewalks on STS-103 in 1999 and STS-109.\n\n5843880: Facts about the Equator for Kids. 1  An equator is the intersection of a sphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface with the plane perpendicular to the sphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s axis of rotation and containing the sphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s center of mass. The Equator is one of the five notable circles of latitude on Earth, with the others being the two Polar Circles and the two Tropical Circles: the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. 2  The imaginary circle obtained when the Earth \u00e2\u0080\u0099s equator is projected onto the sky is called the celestial equator.\n\n5148005: Hubble continued to work as a researcher at the Mount Wilson Observatory and the Palomar Observatory in California until his death on September 28, 1953. He died from a stroke at the age of 63.\n\n3480607: Discovered in 1930, Pluto is the second closest dwarf planet to the Sun and was at one point classified as the ninth planet. Pluto is the largest dwarf planet but only the second most massive, with Eris being the most massive.\n\n1356611: If you have a question about another area of astronomy, find the topic you're interested in from the archive on the side bar or search using the below search form. If you still can't find what you are looking for, submit your question here.\n\n6454480: At almost 36,000km in altitude, an orbit takes a full day to circle the Earth. As the Earth spins on its axis once a day too, these satellites appear fixed in place from our (spinning) Earth-bound perspective.\n\n7747644: Only about 3% of the Sun's light which hits the Moon is reflected. But that's enough to light up our night sky.] The most prominent feature of the Moon's appearance in the sky is the Moon's phase. The Sun, of course, only lights up 1/2 the Moon -- the half that is facing the Sun. This doesn't always correspond to the half that faces the earth. In fact, if the Moon is on the same side of the earth as the Sun, we won't see the Moon at all. It's what we call a New Moon.

One of the two possible planets previously identified around Epsilon Eridani, called Epsilon Eridani b, was discovered in 2000. The planet is thought to orbit at an average distance of 3.4 astronomical units from the star -- just outside the innermost asteroid belt identified by Spitzer. This is the first time that an asteroid belt and a planet beyond our solar system have been found in a similar arrangement as our asteroid belt and Jupiter. Some researchers had reported that Epsilon Eridani b orbits in an exaggerated ellipse ranging between 1 and 5 astronomical units, but this means the planet would cross, and quickly disrupt, the newfound asteroid belt.\n\n4051918: Definition of astronomy for English Language Learners. : the scientific study of stars, planets, and other objects in outer space.\n\n5316461: At the same time, Galileo worked with pendulums.

But that's enough to light up our night sky.] The most prominent feature of the Moon's appearance in the sky is the Moon's phase. The Sun, of course, only lights up 1/2 the Moon -- the half that is facing the Sun. This doesn't always correspond to the half that faces the earth. In fact, if the Moon is on the same side of the earth as the Sun, we won't see the Moon at all. It's what we call a New Moon. If the Moon is on the opposite side of the earth as the Sun, then we have a Full Moon, and we can see the entire 1/2 that the Sun lights up. Note that this means we can tell time by the Moon. We normally tell time by the Sun.\n\n5842405: VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a reid hypergiant in the constellation Canis Major.

AD 127-145, Alexandria), ancient astronomer, geographer, and mathematician who considered the Earth the center of the universe (the Ptolemaic system). Virtually nothing is known about his life.\n\n4049587: For reference, our own asteroid belt lies at about 3 astronomical units from the sun, and Uranus is roughly 19 astronomical units away. One of the two possible planets previously identified around Epsilon Eridani, called Epsilon Eridani b, was discovered in 2000. The planet is thought to orbit at an average distance of 3.4 astronomical units from the star -- just outside the innermost asteroid belt identified by Spitzer. This is the first time that an asteroid belt and a planet beyond our solar system have been found in a similar arrangement as our asteroid belt and Jupiter. Some researchers had reported that Epsilon Eridani b orbits in an exaggerated ellipse ranging between 1 and 5 astronomical units, but this means the planet would cross, and quickly disrupt, the newfound asteroid belt.\n\n4051918: Definition of astronomy for English Language Learners. : the scientific study of stars, planets, and other objects in outer space.\n\n5316461: At the same time, Galileo worked with pendulums. In his life, accurate timekeeping was virtually nonexistent. Galileo observed, however, that the steady motion of a pendulum could improve this. In 1602, he determined that the time it takes a pendulum to swing back and forth does not depend on the arc of the swing.talian astronomer Galileo Galilei provided a number of scientific insights that laid the foundation for future scientists. His investigation of the laws of motion and improvements on the telescope helped further the understanding of the world and universe around him.\n\n5539081: The planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distance from the Sun also varies as it orbits.
