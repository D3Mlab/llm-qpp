From east to west they are Atlantic Standard Time (AST), Eastern Standard Time (EST), Central Standard Time (CST), Mountain Standard Time (MST), Pacific Standard Time (PST), Alaskan Standard Time (AKST), Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (HST), Samoa standard time (UTC-11) and Chamorro Standard Time (UTC+10).\n\n3058243: This time zone is called Mountain Standard Time (MST) during standard time (Winter). It is called Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) during daylight saving time (Summer). In the United States and Canada, this time zone is often just called Mountain Time (MT). The zone is one hour ahead of the Pacific Time Zone and one hour behind the Central Time Zone.\n\n8788166: Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) is observed in the Rocky Mountain area of USA and Canada, as well as Nayarit, Sinaloa, Baja California Sur of Mexico in Summer. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 USA: Colorado, Most Idaho, Most Kansas, Montana, West Nebraska, New Mexico, South West N. Dakota, West S. Dakota, El Paso in Texas, Utah, Wyoming.\n\n1961200: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the equivalent of Eastern Standard Time (EST) plus 5 hours or Eastern Daylight Saving Time (EDT) plus 4 hours. Note: The U.S. POPClock is consistent with Census 2010 data and the most recent national population estimates. Population clocks on the US Census Bureau's Web site will update continuously for one minute and then will update once per minute after the first minute a web page is displayed.\n\n7237338: Meridian lies in the time zone Mountain Standard Time. A Time Zone is a Geographical Area that follows the same time in all the points including Cities, Towns inside that geographical area. Meridian has an UTC Offset/GMT Offset of UTC-5:00. UTC Offset is the time difference between the time at particular place and the UTC - Coordinated Universal Time.\n\n8320625: The Eastern zone is one hour ahead of the Central zone. Here's an example for you: If it's 5:00 P.M in the CST zone, then it is 6:00 P.M in the EST zone. Always add one hour to the Central time to convert to the Eastern one.\n\n5969182: Pennsylvania Time. Current time now in Time Zone: America New York (USA Eastern Time) Pennsylvania (the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) is one of four states of the United States of America that is called a commonwealth. Pennsylvania is called the Keystone State.\n\n2591004: Daylight Saving Time in Canada. In most of Canada Daylight Saving Time begins at 2:00 a.m. local time on the second Sunday in March.

GMT is an absolute time reference and doesn't change with the seasons. The time on the island of Ireland is the same as Greenwich Mean Time less than half of the year. During the summer it becomes GMT+1, that's Irish Standard Time (IST) in the Republic and British Summer Time (BST) in Northern Ireland. BST and IST start from 01:00 GMT Sunday 31 March 2013 until 01:00 GMT Sunday 27 October 2013.\n\n1708936: An example for you: If it is 12 A.M in Eastern Standard Time, then it will be 5 A.M in Greenwich Mean Time. During the summer months, the time change results in a four hour difference between the two since the Eastern zone moves an hour forward in the spring. The Eastern Time Zone.\n\n2763081: I believe that the expression, If you're early, you're on time; if you're on time, you're late, is illogical. My contention is as follows: a) According to the first half of the expression, if you're early, you're on time. This means that to be early is to be on time. In other words, early=on time. b) According to the second half of the expression, if you're on time, you're late. This means that to be on time is to be late. In other words, on time=late. c) Since 'early' and 'on time' are being compared as the same, then that means the word 'early' can be replaced with the phrase, 'on time', and vice versa.\n\n706804: In a great part of Latin American countries, prime time is considered to be from 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. The time slot is usually used for news, telenovelas and television series, and special time slots are used for reality shows, with great popularity, especially in Mexico and Brazil.\n\n3028151: No, because there is no exact time. In the winter when the sun sets at 4:30 in the afternoon, then good evening might be appropriate as early as 5 p.m. In the summer, when the sun sets at 9:30, 5 might still be afternoon.. Six is a reasonable dividing line, if the sun is still up.\n\n4759739: The Sun is directly overhead at high-noon on the summer solstice at the latitude called the Tropic of Cancer. (NASA) Everywhere north of the equator will have at least 12 hours of daylight today. Birmingham, for example, will have 14 hours, 22 minutes and 42 seconds of daylight on Monday.\n\n2398621: Daylight Saving Time Around the World 2014.
