Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: what does postprandial blood sugars mean\n\nDocuments:\n\n7420034: Two-Hour Postprandial Glucose. Glucose, postprandial; glucose, two-hour postprandial; two-hour PPG; two-hour postprandial blood sugar. This is a blood test to check for diabetes. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar in check. This means your blood sugar levels are too high, and over time this can lead to serious health problems including nerve and eye damage. This test is done to see how your body responds to sugar and starch after you eat a meal. As you digest the food in your stomach, blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels rise sharply.\n\n5277502: Typically, the lowest levels of blood sugar occur at the times just before you get your meals of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In normal non-diabetic individuals, the range of their blood glucose levels before eating (between meals) is commonly about 70 mg /dL to 80 mg /dL. Depending on the fit status of each individual, sometime the range of 60-90 mg /dL before meals is still considered normal. 1 2 Next. Tweet Pin It.\n\n547220: Blood Sugar (Definition) 1  The blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. The body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis. 2  See below: It can do can both.\n\n3384555: Of course insulin is a hormone with many factors affecting it, not just sugars in the diet. Things like binge and starve eating patterns (including eating only one or two meals a day), stress and lack of sleep can all cause problems with blood sugar, which lead to the seldom-diagnosed hypoglycemia.\n\n240049: Hypoglycemia Overview. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a commonly perceived problem. In actuality, while some or many of the symptoms may be present, it is rarely confirmed or documented. The presence of true, documented hypoglycemia in the absence of diabetes treatment must be evaluated comprehensively by an endocrinologist.\n\n4771491: When your blood sugar levels are too low, eating something with carbohydrates can help. If you have diabetes, try to keep high-carbohydrate snacks on hand. The American Diabetes Association recommends that your snack have at least 15 grams of carbohydrates (National Institutes of Health).ow blood sugar can happen in people with diabetes who take medicines that increase insulin levels in the body. Taking too much medication, skipping meals, eating less than normal, or exercising more than usual can lead to low blood sugar. Blood sugar is also known as glucose.\n\n4351396: To confirm the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, your doctor will order a fasting plasma glucose test or a casual plasma glucose.\n\n2475436: If you have someone who has diabetes, their problem is that either they aren't producing insulin, or are resistant to it. Without insulin, eating sugar will increase blood sugar. But, essentially, diabetes is not just about blood sugar. It's about, blood sugar and triglycerides, and lipid levels.\n\n589643: Sugar Disease is a problem that manifests in different ways in different individuals, of different ages and of different genetic susceptibility-but its three cardinal forms are:he glycemic index: key to diet for Sugar Disease. Some have proposed that persons with variants of Sugar Disease follow a diet that rigidly excludes carbohydrates, concentrating instead on meat and vegetables. In my opinion this is rarely necessary and results in dietary imbalances.\n\n3594348: All women should get glucose testing during pregnancy. It's a standard test. Your doctor may decide you don't need it if you are under 25, are not overweight, have no family history of diabetes, no history of GDM, no history of stillbirth or no history of large baby.ithout treatment, it can cause problems during pregnancy. There are few basic tests. The glucose challenge screening tests how your body is processing blood sugar. If the results are unusual, you will get a follow-up test.\n\n5700493: Sugar alcohols are one type of reduced-calorie sweetener. You can find them in ice creams, cookies, puddings, candies and chewing gum that is labeled as sugar-free or no sugar added.. Sugar alcohols provide fewer calories than sugar and have less of an effect on blood glucose (blood sugar) than other carbohydrates.ugar alcohols are one type of reduced-calorie sweetener.

Sugar alcohols provide fewer calories than sugar and have less of an effect on blood glucose (blood sugar) than other carbohydrates.\n\n4053759: Brown sugar is white sugar mixed with molasses. When you buy brown sugar, it is soft and fluffy. If stored too long or not stored properly, it turns into a rock-hard, solid brick. (Not a good thing!) There are a few things you can do to keep it from drying out.\n\n4384673: Sugar can be found in a wide variety of foods ranging from fruits to candy.It is important to determine the source of the sugar in your diet. Most of our sugar should come from fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, which contain natural sugars and also include vitamins and minerals.\n\n4075186: Whole Fruits. Although all fruits are generally healthy and good sources of nutrients, vitamins and minerals, some kinds are especially beneficial for a person who already has or is hoping to avoid type-2 diabetes. These include whole fruits that are high in fiber, which can slow the rise in blood sugar after a meal.hole Fruits.

High fructose corn syrup (HFCS)\u00e2\u0080\u0094A liquid mixture of about equal parts of glucose and fructose from cornstarch. Same sweetness as sucrose. Sucrose\u00e2\u0080\u0094A disaccharide or double sugar made of equal parts of glucose and fructose.\n\n4448609: \u00c2\u00b7 just now. Report Abuse. Diabetes is a chronic disease that can cause damage to the organs and the nerves, especially the peripheral nerves which extend into the hands and feet. It is important to keep your feet clean, dry and free of cuts, bruises or sores which may become infected.Every day you should check your feet.E: Why do diabetics have to pay such close attention to their feet? I have noticed that even foot scrubs and similar products are labeled safe or not safe for diabetics to use. I&#39;m borderline diabetic and I have dry cracked heel.\n\n1022489: Blood Glucose Control and Exercise. There are a few ways that exercise lowers blood glucose: Insulin sensitivity is increased, so your cells are better able to use any available insulin to take up glucose during and after activity. When your muscles contract during activity, it stimulates another mechanism that is completely separate of insulin.\n\n176566: There are many different names for sugar. Examples of common names are table sugar, brown sugar, molasses, honey, beet sugar, cane sugar, confectioner's sugar, powdered sugar, raw sugar, turbinado, maple syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, agave nectar and sugar cane syrup.ood sources of dietary fiber include: 1  Beans and legumes. 2  Think black beans, kidney beans, pintos, chick peas (garbanzos), white beans, and lentils. 3  Fruits and vegetables, especially those with edible skin (for example, apples, corn and beans) and those with edible seeds (for example, berries). 4  Whole grains such as:\n\n7666629: Blood sugar then drops or plummets, causing the adrenals to work to bring levels back up. When you are suffering from fatigued adrenal glands, cortisol levels drop and make it difficult to maintain normal blood sugar levels. People with adrenal fatigue tend to have low blood sugar.\n\n7592328: One is that depression leads to psychobiological changes that cause big fluctuations in blood sugar levels, which may make it harder to prevent low blood sugar levels. The other possibility is that depression leads to a lack of interest in the self-care that's necessary to manage diabetes well.\n\n4688250: Type 2 diabetes was also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is often a milder form of diabetes than type 1. Nevertheless, type 2 diabetes can still cause major health complications, particularly in the smallest blood vessels in the body that nourish the kidneys, nerves, and eyes. Type 2 diabetes also increases your risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n4496250: You shouldn't get hypoglycemia if you take alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides (such as metformin), and thiazolidinediones alone, but it can happen when you take them with sulfonylureas or insulin.\n\n3344011: Because of its highly-potent sweetness, stevia is used as a zero-calorie sweetener in a variety of foods and drinks. The best-tasting, purified parts of the stevia plant \u00e2\u0080\u0093 stevia leaf extract \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is a great alternative to sugar, and it does not raise blood glucose levels, a concern for people with diabetes.\n\n2124759: In gestational diabetes, the pancreas is not at fault.

Glucose, postprandial; glucose, two-hour postprandial; two-hour PPG; two-hour postprandial blood sugar. This is a blood test to check for diabetes. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar in check. This means your blood sugar levels are too high, and over time this can lead to serious health problems including nerve and eye damage. This test is done to see how your body responds to sugar and starch after you eat a meal. As you digest the food in your stomach, blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels rise sharply.\n\n5277502: Typically, the lowest levels of blood sugar occur at the times just before you get your meals of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In normal non-diabetic individuals, the range of their blood glucose levels before eating (between meals) is commonly about 70 mg /dL to 80 mg /dL. Depending on the fit status of each individual, sometime the range of 60-90 mg /dL before meals is still considered normal. 1 2 Next. Tweet Pin It.\n\n547220: Blood Sugar (Definition) 1  The blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. The body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis. 2  See below: It can do can both.\n\n3384555: Of course insulin is a hormone with many factors affecting it, not just sugars in the diet. Things like binge and starve eating patterns (including eating only one or two meals a day), stress and lack of sleep can all cause problems with blood sugar, which lead to the seldom-diagnosed hypoglycemia.\n\n240049: Hypoglycemia Overview. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a commonly perceived problem. In actuality, while some or many of the symptoms may be present, it is rarely confirmed or documented.

Glucose, postprandial; glucose, two-hour postprandial; two-hour PPG; two-hour postprandial blood sugar. This is a blood test to check for diabetes. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar in check. This means your blood sugar levels are too high, and over time this can lead to serious health problems including nerve and eye damage. This test is done to see how your body responds to sugar and starch after you eat a meal. As you digest the food in your stomach, blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels rise sharply.\n\n5277502: Typically, the lowest levels of blood sugar occur at the times just before you get your meals of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In normal non-diabetic individuals, the range of their blood glucose levels before eating (between meals) is commonly about 70 mg /dL to 80 mg /dL. Depending on the fit status of each individual, sometime the range of 60-90 mg /dL before meals is still considered normal. 1 2 Next. Tweet Pin It.\n\n547220: Blood Sugar (Definition) 1  The blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. The body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis. 2  See below: It can do can both.\n\n3384555: Of course insulin is a hormone with many factors affecting it, not just sugars in the diet. Things like binge and starve eating patterns (including eating only one or two meals a day), stress and lack of sleep can all cause problems with blood sugar, which lead to the seldom-diagnosed hypoglycemia.\n\n240049: Hypoglycemia Overview. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a commonly perceived problem. In actuality, while some or many of the symptoms may be present, it is rarely confirmed or documented. The presence of true, documented hypoglycemia in the absence of diabetes treatment must be evaluated comprehensively by an endocrinologist.\n\n4771491: When your blood sugar levels are too low, eating something with carbohydrates can help. If you have diabetes, try to keep high-carbohydrate snacks on hand. The American Diabetes Association recommends that your snack have at least 15 grams of carbohydrates (National Institutes of Health).ow blood sugar can happen in people with diabetes who take medicines that increase insulin levels in the body. Taking too much medication, skipping meals, eating less than normal, or exercising more than usual can lead to low blood sugar. Blood sugar is also known as glucose.\n\n4351396: To confirm the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, your doctor will order a fasting plasma glucose test or a casual plasma glucose.\n\n2475436: If you have someone who has diabetes, their problem is that either they aren't producing insulin, or are resistant to it. Without insulin, eating sugar will increase blood sugar. But, essentially, diabetes is not just about blood sugar. It's about, blood sugar and triglycerides, and lipid levels.\n\n589643: Sugar Disease is a problem that manifests in different ways in different individuals, of different ages and of different genetic susceptibility-but its three cardinal forms are:he glycemic index: key to diet for Sugar Disease. Some have proposed that persons with variants of Sugar Disease follow a diet that rigidly excludes carbohydrates, concentrating instead on meat and vegetables. In my opinion this is rarely necessary and results in dietary imbalances.\n\n3594348: All women should get glucose testing during pregnancy. It's a standard test. Your doctor may decide you don't need it if you are under 25, are not overweight, have no family history of diabetes, no history of GDM, no history of stillbirth or no history of large baby.ithout treatment, it can cause problems during pregnancy. There are few basic tests. The glucose challenge screening tests how your body is processing blood sugar. If the results are unusual, you will get a follow-up test.\n\n5700493: Sugar alcohols are one type of reduced-calorie sweetener. You can find them in ice creams, cookies, puddings, candies and chewing gum that is labeled as sugar-free or no sugar added.. Sugar alcohols provide fewer calories than sugar and have less of an effect on blood glucose (blood sugar) than other carbohydrates.ugar alcohols are one type of reduced-calorie sweetener.

Sugar alcohols provide fewer calories than sugar and have less of an effect on blood glucose (blood sugar) than other carbohydrates.\n\n4053759: Brown sugar is white sugar mixed with molasses. When you buy brown sugar, it is soft and fluffy. If stored too long or not stored properly, it turns into a rock-hard, solid brick. (Not a good thing!)

It is important to keep your feet clean, dry and free of cuts, bruises or sores which may become infected.Every day you should check your feet.E: Why do diabetics have to pay such close attention to their feet? I have noticed that even foot scrubs and similar products are labeled safe or not safe for diabetics to use. I&#39;m borderline diabetic and I have dry cracked heel.\n\n1022489: Blood Glucose Control and Exercise. There are a few ways that exercise lowers blood glucose: Insulin sensitivity is increased, so your cells are better able to use any available insulin to take up glucose during and after activity. When your muscles contract during activity, it stimulates another mechanism that is completely separate of insulin.\n\n176566: There are many different names for sugar. Examples of common names are table sugar, brown sugar, molasses, honey, beet sugar, cane sugar, confectioner's sugar, powdered sugar, raw sugar, turbinado, maple syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, agave nectar and sugar cane syrup.ood sources of dietary fiber include: 1  Beans and legumes. 2  Think black beans, kidney beans, pintos, chick peas (garbanzos), white beans, and lentils. 3  Fruits and vegetables, especially those with edible skin (for example, apples, corn and beans) and those with edible seeds (for example, berries). 4  Whole grains such as:\n\n7666629: Blood sugar then drops or plummets, causing the adrenals to work to bring levels back up. When you are suffering from fatigued adrenal glands, cortisol levels drop and make it difficult to maintain normal blood sugar levels. People with adrenal fatigue tend to have low blood sugar.\n\n7592328: One is that depression leads to psychobiological changes that cause big fluctuations in blood sugar levels, which may make it harder to prevent low blood sugar levels. The other possibility is that depression leads to a lack of interest in the self-care that's necessary to manage diabetes well.\n\n4688250: Type 2 diabetes was also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is often a milder form of diabetes than type 1. Nevertheless, type 2 diabetes can still cause major health complications, particularly in the smallest blood vessels in the body that nourish the kidneys, nerves, and eyes. Type 2 diabetes also increases your risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n4496250: You shouldn't get hypoglycemia if you take alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides (such as metformin), and thiazolidinediones alone, but it can happen when you take them with sulfonylureas or insulin.\n\n3344011: Because of its highly-potent sweetness, stevia is used as a zero-calorie sweetener in a variety of foods and drinks. The best-tasting, purified parts of the stevia plant \u00e2\u0080\u0093 stevia leaf extract \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is a great alternative to sugar, and it does not raise blood glucose levels, a concern for people with diabetes.\n\n2124759: In gestational diabetes, the pancreas is not at fault. Instead, the problem is in the placenta. During pregnancy, the placenta provides the baby with nourishment. It also produces a number of hormones that interfere with the body's usual response to insulin.\n\n8086203: Best Answer: 'persnickety' or 'pernickety' means worrying too much about unimportant details or being 'fussy'. 'seredipidious' is the adj. form of 'serendipity', which is used to describe something interesting or pleasant happening by chance. eg: serendipitious discoveries. it has been a pleasure answering your question.\n\n1503573: No. Type 1 diabetes is known as insulin-dependent or juvenile onset diabetes.

Some people with type 2 diabetes take insulin, but it is not known as insulin-dependent diabetes.\n\n3467545: The Diet. The Perricone Prescription is presented as an anti-wrinkle diet with weight loss as an added benefit. In the diet, what you eat is just as important as the order in which you eat it. For example, protein is to be eaten first and Perricone suggests that the salmon consumed should be wild, or at the least organic. From a scientific perspective, the Perricone diet aims to regulate blood sugar levels by eating foods that have a low glycemic index, according to Diet.com.\n\n4192447: If the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin, or if the body cannot use the insulin properly, blood sugar levels rise and the body cannot use foods effectively. High blood sugar levels are harmful to many body tissues. Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal problem of people with diabetes.\n\n5396820: What is Pernicious Anemia (Vitamin B-12 Deficiency)?
