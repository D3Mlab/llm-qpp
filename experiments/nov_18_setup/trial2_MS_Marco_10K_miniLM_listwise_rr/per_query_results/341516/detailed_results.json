Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: how tall is the statue of liberty?\n\nDocuments:\n\n7626476: Confidence votes 3. The Statue of Liberty, located on Liberty Island in the New York Harbor was given to the United States as a gift from the people of France in October of 1886. The statue itself is 46 metres tall (151 feet). From the ground to the top of her torch, the statue is 93 metres tall (305 feet).\n\n8299550: Fifty-eight Liberty ships were lengthened by 70 feet (21 m) starting in 1958. This gave the ships an additional 640 long tons (650 t) of carrying capacity at a small additional cost. The bridges of most of these were also enclosed in the mid-1960s in accordance with a design by naval architect Ion Livas.\n\n6660992: Last updated on September 19, 2014 in Culture 7 Comments.
