Ferns, horsetails, and their allies make up the second group of land plants, the pteridophytes.These plants all have vascular systems, made up of xylem (flow of water and nutrients from roots to leaves) and phloem (flow of sugars and other metabolic products from leaves to roots).e need to mention these because the four plant groups each have unique alternation of generations. Mosses. The first group of land plants are the mosses and their allies, the liverworts and hornworts.\n\n959168: The proximal tubule is the portion of the duct system of the nephron of the kidney which leads from Bowman's capsule to the loop of Henle.he proximal tubule as a part of the nephron can be divided into two sections, pars convoluta and pars recta.
