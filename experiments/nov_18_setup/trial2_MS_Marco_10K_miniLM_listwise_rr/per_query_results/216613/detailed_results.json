Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: how do car brakes work\n\nDocuments:\n\n7829049: How Do Car Brakes Work? When a car's brake pedals are pushed, a rod comes into the master cylinder and forces brake fluid through the brake line and into the calipers. Find out how calipers push pistons and cause brake pads to smash together with help from an auto mechanic in this free video on car repair and diagnostics.\n\n1371316: These calipers work with \u00e2\u0080\u009cshort-pull\u00e2\u0080\u009d brake levers (see brake levers section below). Cantilever Brakes: This type of brake bolts on to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrake bosses\u00e2\u0080\u009d on either side of the wheel. Brake bosses are threaded tubes which the manufacturer attaches to the frame. Cantilever brakes also work with short pull brake levers. They require a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccable yoke\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cstraddle cable\u00e2\u0080\u009d to operate.\n\n6234178: So if you apply a 100-pound downward force to the left piston, a 900-pound upward force will appear on the right. The only catch is that you will have to depress the left piston 9 inches to raise the right piston 1 inch. The brakes in your car are a good example of a basic piston-driven hydraulic system.When you depress the brake pedal in your car, it is pushing on the piston in the brake's master cylinder. Four slave pistons, one at each wheel, actuate to press the brake pads against the brake rotor to stop the car.he brakes in your car are a good example of a basic piston-driven hydraulic system. When you depress the brake pedal in your car, it is pushing on the piston in the brake's master cylinder.\n\n7669661: Vacuum Bleeding. Connect an Mighty-Vac or similar suction tool to the bleeder valve. Apply a vacuum with the suction tool. Open the valve and suck the brake fluid and air bubbles out of the valve. Do not let the master cylinder run dry or air will be introduced to the system.\n\n7503663: The terms parking brake and emergency brake are used interchangeably in the automotive world to refer to a purely mechanical brake system that can be actuated in the event of hydraulic failure, or used to secure a car when the motor is off and the car is parked.\n\n2067825: An automotive battery is used to start the car, power the lights, and more. When you drive, your engine constantly recharges the battery. However, these batteries have a set life and at some point you will need a replacement battery.\n\n8214750: A force always causes the centripetal acceleration. For a swingball (or tetherball) game, it is the tension in the string. For a satellite, it is the force of gravity. For a car moving around a corner, it is the frictional force between the car and the road. If you remove that force, you remove the centripetal acceleration, and if you remove the centripetal acceleration, the object will continue in a straight line tangent to the circle. Equation\n\n7296768: If your brake fluid boils, it can cause your brakes to fail. (I've never seen this happen on a street car; this would be a bigger concern on a race car or something like that.) Remember that brakes turn speed into heat. Your brake fluid has to deal with that heat.\n\n5224471: Published on Sep 2, 2013. How to replace rear shock absorbers on a Mercedes c'class,clk-class,e-class, all are very similar... lower shock bolts 42 ftlbs. upper shock main bolt 13 ftlbs.\n\n7173716: A. Removing the Master Cylinder. 1  Remove the reservoir cap of the fluid container on the master cylinder. 2  Using the syringe, remove some brake fluid from the container until it reached the minimum level.  Put the 4-in by 4-in Glad-o-wrap plastic seal on top of the master cylinder fluid container.\n\n846822: Trail braking can be very useful for street riders. Downhill corners is one example. Braking skill does not only apply to stopping your motorcycle, it is also important for safe cornering. The first rule for safe cornering is to enter a turn at a safe speed.\n\n1000360: How It Works. T cells, a type of immune cell, are present with receptors on their surface, called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. Typically these TCRs bind to antigens to mount an immune response. In an attempt to use T cells for cancer therapy, T cells are collected from a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own blood.\n\n1458078: Install the new cotter pin, grease the arm and you are finished. The idler and pitman arms are the links that connect your steering box to the center link which in turn rotates the hubs on the A arms causing the truck to turn. The idler arm simply supports the other side of the center link.If there is free play in any of these parts your steering will be sloppy.nstall the new cotter pin, grease the arm and you are finished. The idler and pitman arms are the links that connect your steering box to the center link which in turn rotates the hubs on the A arms causing the truck to turn. The idler arm simply supports the other side of the center link.\n\n2602927: Location: Florida. Vehicle: Other Non-Hybrid. Model: N/A. Hey All, I'm new to the forum, I don't own a Prius or any other hybrid. I know a bit about the PSD and can understand how the engine and motor/generators can be combined to make rear wheel torque.\n\n4225239: One loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group (COOH) and the other loses a hydrogen from its amino group (NH 2). This reaction produces a molecule of water (H 2 O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide.\n\n1341752: An immobiliser or immobilizer is an electronic security device fitted to an automobile that prevents the engine from running unless the correct key (or other token) is present.This prevents the car from being  hot wired  after entry has been achieved and helping to reducing motor vehicle theft.ater models use rolling codes or advanced cryptography to defeat copying of the code from the key or ECU. The microcircuit inside the key is activated by a small electromagnetic field which induces current to flow inside the key body, which in turn broadcasts a unique binary code which is read by the automobile's ECU.\n\n1056040: Debt is money owed by one party, the borrower or debtor, to a second party, the lender or creditor. The borrower may be a sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. The lender may be a bank, credit card company, payday loan provider, or an individual. Debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest.\n\n1281045: used bolt cutters.

When a car's brake pedals are pushed, a rod comes into the master cylinder and forces brake fluid through the brake line and into the calipers. Find out how calipers push pistons and cause brake pads to smash together with help from an auto mechanic in this free video on car repair and diagnostics.\n\n1371316: These calipers work with \u00e2\u0080\u009cshort-pull\u00e2\u0080\u009d brake levers (see brake levers section below). Cantilever Brakes: This type of brake bolts on to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrake bosses\u00e2\u0080\u009d on either side of the wheel. Brake bosses are threaded tubes which the manufacturer attaches to the frame. Cantilever brakes also work with short pull brake levers. They require a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccable yoke\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cstraddle cable\u00e2\u0080\u009d to operate.\n\n6234178: So if you apply a 100-pound downward force to the left piston, a 900-pound upward force will appear on the right. The only catch is that you will have to depress the left piston 9 inches to raise the right piston 1 inch. The brakes in your car are a good example of a basic piston-driven hydraulic system.When you depress the brake pedal in your car, it is pushing on the piston in the brake's master cylinder. Four slave pistons, one at each wheel, actuate to press the brake pads against the brake rotor to stop the car.he brakes in your car are a good example of a basic piston-driven hydraulic system. When you depress the brake pedal in your car, it is pushing on the piston in the brake's master cylinder.\n\n7669661: Vacuum Bleeding. Connect an Mighty-Vac or similar suction tool to the bleeder valve. Apply a vacuum with the suction tool. Open the valve and suck the brake fluid and air bubbles out of the valve. Do not let the master cylinder run dry or air will be introduced to the system.\n\n7503663: The terms parking brake and emergency brake are used interchangeably in the automotive world to refer to a purely mechanical brake system that can be actuated in the event of hydraulic failure, or used to secure a car when the motor is off and the car is parked.\n\n2067825: An automotive battery is used to start the car, power the lights, and more. When you drive, your engine constantly recharges the battery. However, these batteries have a set life and at some point you will need a replacement battery.\n\n8214750: A force always causes the centripetal acceleration. For a swingball (or tetherball) game, it is the tension in the string. For a satellite, it is the force of gravity. For a car moving around a corner, it is the frictional force between the car and the road. If you remove that force, you remove the centripetal acceleration, and if you remove the centripetal acceleration, the object will continue in a straight line tangent to the circle. Equation\n\n7296768: If your brake fluid boils, it can cause your brakes to fail. (I've never seen this happen on a street car; this would be a bigger concern on a race car or something like that.) Remember that brakes turn speed into heat. Your brake fluid has to deal with that heat.\n\n5224471: Published on Sep 2, 2013. How to replace rear shock absorbers on a Mercedes c'class,clk-class,e-class, all are very similar... lower shock bolts 42 ftlbs. upper shock main bolt 13 ftlbs.\n\n7173716: A. Removing the Master Cylinder. 1  Remove the reservoir cap of the fluid container on the master cylinder. 2  Using the syringe, remove some brake fluid from the container until it reached the minimum level.  Put the 4-in by 4-in Glad-o-wrap plastic seal on top of the master cylinder fluid container.\n\n846822: Trail braking can be very useful for street riders. Downhill corners is one example. Braking skill does not only apply to stopping your motorcycle, it is also important for safe cornering. The first rule for safe cornering is to enter a turn at a safe speed.\n\n1000360: How It Works. T cells, a type of immune cell, are present with receptors on their surface, called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. Typically these TCRs bind to antigens to mount an immune response. In an attempt to use T cells for cancer therapy, T cells are collected from a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own blood.\n\n1458078: Install the new cotter pin, grease the arm and you are finished. The idler and pitman arms are the links that connect your steering box to the center link which in turn rotates the hubs on the A arms causing the truck to turn. The idler arm simply supports the other side of the center link.If there is free play in any of these parts your steering will be sloppy.nstall the new cotter pin, grease the arm and you are finished. The idler and pitman arms are the links that connect your steering box to the center link which in turn rotates the hubs on the A arms causing the truck to turn. The idler arm simply supports the other side of the center link.\n\n2602927: Location: Florida. Vehicle: Other Non-Hybrid. Model: N/A. Hey All, I'm new to the forum, I don't own a Prius or any other hybrid.

This reaction produces a molecule of water (H 2 O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide.\n\n1341752: An immobiliser or immobilizer is an electronic security device fitted to an automobile that prevents the engine from running unless the correct key (or other token) is present.This prevents the car from being  hot wired  after entry has been achieved and helping to reducing motor vehicle theft.ater models use rolling codes or advanced cryptography to defeat copying of the code from the key or ECU. The microcircuit inside the key is activated by a small electromagnetic field which induces current to flow inside the key body, which in turn broadcasts a unique binary code which is read by the automobile's ECU.\n\n1056040: Debt is money owed by one party, the borrower or debtor, to a second party, the lender or creditor. The borrower may be a sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. The lender may be a bank, credit card company, payday loan provider, or an individual. Debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest.\n\n1281045: used bolt cutters.

Vancomycin, when taken by mouth, is used to treat Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (also called C diff). C diff is a type of bacteria that causes severe diarrhea. Oral Vancomycin is also used to treat enterocolitis caused by a certain bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus).\n\n1763146: Occasionally, a splint may be used to hold the break in place while it heals. If the break has caused the bone fragments to move by a large amount, then finger manipulation may be needed to realign the bone. A splint is then used to hold the bone in place while it heals. Some broken fingers need operations to give them the best chance of healing. This can be due to the break being unstable (ie after manipulation, the bone ends are being pulled out of place by adjacent muscles). What operations may be needed for broken fingers?\n\n7668871: New car dealerships also sell used cars, and take in trade-ins and/or purchase used vehicles at auction. Most dealerships also provide a series of additional services for car buyers and owners, which are sometimes more profitable than the core business of selling cars.ince most states have requirements for a dealer to warranty or even guarantee a used vehicle for a certain amount of time and or mileage if sold to the public at a certain price, a dealer must make a profit selling the previously traded car (now a used car). Trade in value is an important facet of the car deal.\n\n7215839: Automotive design in this context is primarily concerned with developing the visual appearance or aesthetics of the vehicle, though it is also involved in the creation of the product concept.

This cartilage, also known as articular cartilage serves a function as shock-absorber and also, along with the secretion of synovial fluid in the membrane, helps reduce friction.he synovial membrane secretes synovial fluid that lubricates the articular surfaces of the joint. In some joints, the synovial membrane extends outside the joint capsule to form a bursa.\n\n4422344: The primary function of these components working together is to create movement. Other functions include stability, posture and protection. Along with the joints, which act as fulcrums, the bones and muscles work together to create levers in the body.\n\n3753531: The femoral nerve is a nerve in the thigh that supplies skin on the upper thigh and inner leg, and the muscles that extend the knee.\n\n6716238: Heat and Chemical Reactions Most chemical reactions involve the breaking and formation of chemical bonds. It takes energy to break a chemical bond but energy is released when chemical bonds are formed. If more energy is released than consumed, then the chemical reaction evolves heat and is said to be exothermic. On the other hand if the reaction consumes more energy than it releases then the reaction absorbs heat and is said to be endothermic. Most reactions are exothermic.\n\n3729144: There are two types of glands in the endocrine system, exocrine glands that take their secretions to the surface through ducts that exit the body (e.g., mammary, sebaceous, sweat, and glands that secrete digestive enzymes), and endocrine glands, the seven sets of gland secrete different hormones directly into the blood (they do not have ducts that carry their secretions to the surface and out of the body); the endocrine hormones are\n\n1734537: During photosynthesis light energy is converted to the energy in chemical bonds. What also happens according to the predictions of the second law of thermodynamics. Heat is released in the process. The energy acquired in the light dependent reactions is used in light independent reactions to build glucose molecules.\n\n1281480: When starch, which contains amylose and amylopectin, is heated in water, the hydrogen bonds break. When they break, water enters into the starch molecule. Amylose doesn't particularly care for hot water, so it moves out of the starch molecule.\n\n7814291: Two types of software are application software and system software. Application software consists of programs that perform specific tasks for users, such as a word processing program, e-mail program, or Web browser. System software consists of the programs that control the operations of a computer and its devices. The two types of system software are operating systems and utility programs.

Messages also are carried up the spinal cord to the brain to allow you to feel sensations. The spinal cord also helps in controlling blood pressure, heart rate, and the temperature of the body. There are nerves that branch off the spinal cord. They are called spinal nerves. The nerves are divided into five main sections (from top to bottom): cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and cocygeal. They help control bodily functions such as breathing, urination, and bowel movements.\n\n2403874: Parallel Immobilization Technique. All three terms mean the same thing, a bumping technique used by U.S. police departments during car pursuits to force the pursued vehicle to abruptly turn sideways to the direction of travel, causing the driver to lose control and stop. Usually used in the phrase PIT maneuver.\n\n8306373: Like stocks, bonds can be traded. When someone sells a bond at a price lower than the face value, it's said to be selling at a discount. If sold at a price higher than the face value, it's selling at a premium. Now that we know the basics, let's take a look at the different types of bonds.\n\n7373168: Nicotine is the tobacco plant's natural protection from being eaten by insects.

This happens at mid-ocean ridges. Plates move towards one another at convergent boundaries; one plate is forced below another in a process called subduction. Earthquakes and composite volcanoes are common at this type of boundary.Plates move past on another at transform boundaries. The most famous example of this type of boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California. Image: Cutaway artwork showing different types of plate boundary and hotspots. Convergent boundaries are areas where plates move toward each other and collide. 2  These are also known as compressional or destructive boundaries. 3  Subduction zones occur where an oceanic plate meets a continental plate and is pushed underneath it. 4  Subduction zones are marked by oceanic trenches.\n\n5088188: The knee joint capsule is a sac that encloses the knee joint cavity.

Most plants are able to make food directly from light energy, for example the Sun, instead of eating other organisms or relying on nutrients. Photosynthesis can happen in plants because they have chlorophyll.Chlorophyll is the pigment that makes plants green. Chlorophyll captures the Sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy and uses it to make sugars out of carbon dioxide from the air and water. The sugars fuel a plant's roots, stems, and leaves so the plant can grow.After plants use the Sun's light to make their food, plants release oxygen into the air. This oxygen is very helpful because humans and animals need it to breathe.he sugars fuel a plant's roots, stems, and leaves so the plant can grow.

When a car's brake pedals are pushed, a rod comes into the master cylinder and forces brake fluid through the brake line and into the calipers. Find out how calipers push pistons and cause brake pads to smash together with help from an auto mechanic in this free video on car repair and diagnostics.\n\n1371316: These calipers work with \u00e2\u0080\u009cshort-pull\u00e2\u0080\u009d brake levers (see brake levers section below). Cantilever Brakes: This type of brake bolts on to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrake bosses\u00e2\u0080\u009d on either side of the wheel. Brake bosses are threaded tubes which the manufacturer attaches to the frame. Cantilever brakes also work with short pull brake levers. They require a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccable yoke\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cstraddle cable\u00e2\u0080\u009d to operate.\n\n6234178: So if you apply a 100-pound downward force to the left piston, a 900-pound upward force will appear on the right. The only catch is that you will have to depress the left piston 9 inches to raise the right piston 1 inch. The brakes in your car are a good example of a basic piston-driven hydraulic system.When you depress the brake pedal in your car, it is pushing on the piston in the brake's master cylinder. Four slave pistons, one at each wheel, actuate to press the brake pads against the brake rotor to stop the car.he brakes in your car are a good example of a basic piston-driven hydraulic system. When you depress the brake pedal in your car, it is pushing on the piston in the brake's master cylinder.\n\n7669661: Vacuum Bleeding. Connect an Mighty-Vac or similar suction tool to the bleeder valve. Apply a vacuum with the suction tool. Open the valve and suck the brake fluid and air bubbles out of the valve. Do not let the master cylinder run dry or air will be introduced to the system.\n\n7503663: The terms parking brake and emergency brake are used interchangeably in the automotive world to refer to a purely mechanical brake system that can be actuated in the event of hydraulic failure, or used to secure a car when the motor is off and the car is parked.\n\n2067825: An automotive battery is used to start the car, power the lights, and more. When you drive, your engine constantly recharges the battery. However, these batteries have a set life and at some point you will need a replacement battery.\n\n8214750: A force always causes the centripetal acceleration. For a swingball (or tetherball) game, it is the tension in the string. For a satellite, it is the force of gravity. For a car moving around a corner, it is the frictional force between the car and the road. If you remove that force, you remove the centripetal acceleration, and if you remove the centripetal acceleration, the object will continue in a straight line tangent to the circle. Equation\n\n7296768: If your brake fluid boils, it can cause your brakes to fail. (I've never seen this happen on a street car; this would be a bigger concern on a race car or something like that.) Remember that brakes turn speed into heat. Your brake fluid has to deal with that heat.\n\n5224471: Published on Sep 2, 2013. How to replace rear shock absorbers on a Mercedes c'class,clk-class,e-class, all are very similar... lower shock bolts 42 ftlbs. upper shock main bolt 13 ftlbs.\n\n7173716: A. Removing the Master Cylinder. 1  Remove the reservoir cap of the fluid container on the master cylinder. 2  Using the syringe, remove some brake fluid from the container until it reached the minimum level.  Put the 4-in by 4-in Glad-o-wrap plastic seal on top of the master cylinder fluid container.\n\n846822: Trail braking can be very useful for street riders. Downhill corners is one example. Braking skill does not only apply to stopping your motorcycle, it is also important for safe cornering. The first rule for safe cornering is to enter a turn at a safe speed.\n\n1000360: How It Works. T cells, a type of immune cell, are present with receptors on their surface, called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. Typically these TCRs bind to antigens to mount an immune response. In an attempt to use T cells for cancer therapy, T cells are collected from a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own blood.\n\n1458078: Install the new cotter pin, grease the arm and you are finished. The idler and pitman arms are the links that connect your steering box to the center link which in turn rotates the hubs on the A arms causing the truck to turn. The idler arm simply supports the other side of the center link.If there is free play in any of these parts your steering will be sloppy.nstall the new cotter pin, grease the arm and you are finished.

Hey All, I'm new to the forum, I don't own a Prius or any other hybrid. I know a bit about the PSD and can understand how the engine and motor/generators can be combined to make rear wheel torque.\n\n4225239: One loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group (COOH) and the other loses a hydrogen from its amino group (NH 2). This reaction produces a molecule of water (H 2 O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide.\n\n1341752: An immobiliser or immobilizer is an electronic security device fitted to an automobile that prevents the engine from running unless the correct key (or other token) is present.This prevents the car from being  hot wired  after entry has been achieved and helping to reducing motor vehicle theft.ater models use rolling codes or advanced cryptography to defeat copying of the code from the key or ECU. The microcircuit inside the key is activated by a small electromagnetic field which induces current to flow inside the key body, which in turn broadcasts a unique binary code which is read by the automobile's ECU.\n\n1056040: Debt is money owed by one party, the borrower or debtor, to a second party, the lender or creditor. The borrower may be a sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. The lender may be a bank, credit card company, payday loan provider, or an individual. Debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest.\n\n1281045: used bolt cutters.
