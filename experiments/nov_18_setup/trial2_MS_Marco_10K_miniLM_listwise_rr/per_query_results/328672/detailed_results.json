Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: how much time should you cook smoked turkey wings\n\nDocuments:\n\n8005830: Turkey wings: Set smoker to 225\u00c2\u00b0F. Cook for about 1 1/2 -2 hours. Whole turkey: Preheat grill to medium-high heat (about 325\u00c2\u00b0F) and set up to cook with indirect heat. Cook about 15 minutes per pound, or about 3 hours.\n\n5368694: if you cut thawed turkey breast into cutlets, you can reduce the cook time significantly. Bake your cutlets for 20-25 minutes at 375\u00c2\u00ba F. Cooked portions will last 3-4 days in the refrigerator so you may wish to freeze some of your cooked portions if you won't be eating them ight away.\n\n8109320: To do so, defrost in the fridge for a few days before you plan on cooking. Once defrosted, or if you bought a fresh bird, take the turkey out of the refrigerator 45 minutes to 1 hour before roasting. This technique will allow the turkey to come to (almost) room temperature, helping it cook more evenly and quickly.\n\n2463758: The best way to get the turkey into the oil is to use the coat-hanger-shaped apparatus that comes with your frying rig. Cook for about 3 minutes per pound for a whole turkey, approximately 45 minutes for a 15 pound turkey, only 36 mintues for a 12 pounder!.\n\n3412545: Here are some instructions from Butterball on roasting a turkey breast in a convection oven. http://www.butterball.com/how-tos/roast-a-turkey.

Weight Cook Time (Unstuffed) Cook Time (Stuffed). 3-5\u00c2\u00bd lbs. 1\u00c2\u00bd -2 hrs. 1\u00c2\u00be-2\u00c2\u00bd hrs. 5\u00c2\u00bd-9 lbs.\n\n6383151: The oven-roasting bag keeps the turkey very moist and it speeds up the roasting time. The following cooking times can be used as a guideline for an unstuffed turkey roasted in an oven bag in a 350\u00c2\u00b0F conventional oven. An additional 30 minutes or more may be required for a stuffed turkey. Insert a fork into the thigh or breast of a turkey, if juices are clear the turkey is fully cooked. 2  Do no refreeze thawed poultry. 3  Within 2 hours of the start of your meal, all perishable foods must be refrigerated. 4  If you cook a turkey that comes with a pop-up timer, the cooking process can be almost foolproof.\n\n8174847: I cook mine at 350 for about 30 minutes but it honestly depends on they type of chicken pieces you have (breasts, thighs, legs, wings and if they have the bone in or boneless.) Start at 350 for 20 minutes in the oven and check the temp and see if you need more time.\n\n579250: The length of time to cook a roasted chicken is determined by its weight, notes Better Homes and Gardens. A 2.5-pound bird can be cooked as quickly as one hour at 375 degrees Fahrenheit, while a 5-pound bird can take as long as two hours at the same temperature.\n\n496259: Place turkey breast side up on a flat rack in a shallow roasting pan 2 to 2 1/2 inches deep. Turn the wings back to hold the neck skin in place. (Tucking the wings will help stabilize the turkey in the pan and when carving) Brush or spray skin lightly with vegetable or cooking oil for best appearance.lace turkey in pre-heated oven. When turkey is about 3/4 done, loosely cover breast and top of drumsticks with a piece of foil to prevent overcooking. After about 3 hours, insert an oven-safe thermometer deep into the thigh without touching the bone.\n\n1999966: Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the roast in a roasting pan, fat side up. Place the roasting pan in the oven, uncovered. Roast the meat. You're only going to let it roast for about 15 minutes at 450 degrees Fahrenheit, so set your timer.After 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.Remove the pan from oven. The roast is finished once the internal temperature of the meat hits at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit for rare, 145 degrees for medium rare, 160 degrees for medium, and 170 degrees for well done.fter 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove the pan from oven.

Bring this mixture to boiling.\n\n5254293: 1 Brown the chicken pieces, in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the skillet. 2  When nicely browned on all sides, remove chicken, drain briefly and place in a large ovenproof casserole dish. 3  Add the chopped onion and celery to the oil remaining in the skillet.

Cook for about 1 1/2 -2 hours. Whole turkey: Preheat grill to medium-high heat (about 325\u00c2\u00b0F) and set up to cook with indirect heat. Cook about 15 minutes per pound, or about 3 hours.\n\n5368694: if you cut thawed turkey breast into cutlets, you can reduce the cook time significantly. Bake your cutlets for 20-25 minutes at 375\u00c2\u00ba F. Cooked portions will last 3-4 days in the refrigerator so you may wish to freeze some of your cooked portions if you won't be eating them ight away.\n\n8109320: To do so, defrost in the fridge for a few days before you plan on cooking. Once defrosted, or if you bought a fresh bird, take the turkey out of the refrigerator 45 minutes to 1 hour before roasting. This technique will allow the turkey to come to (almost) room temperature, helping it cook more evenly and quickly.\n\n2463758: The best way to get the turkey into the oil is to use the coat-hanger-shaped apparatus that comes with your frying rig.

An additional 30 minutes or more may be required for a stuffed turkey. Insert a fork into the thigh or breast of a turkey, if juices are clear the turkey is fully cooked. 2  Do no refreeze thawed poultry. 3  Within 2 hours of the start of your meal, all perishable foods must be refrigerated. 4  If you cook a turkey that comes with a pop-up timer, the cooking process can be almost foolproof.\n\n8174847: I cook mine at 350 for about 30 minutes but it honestly depends on they type of chicken pieces you have (breasts, thighs, legs, wings and if they have the bone in or boneless.)

Cook for about 1 1/2 -2 hours. Whole turkey: Preheat grill to medium-high heat (about 325\u00c2\u00b0F) and set up to cook with indirect heat. Cook about 15 minutes per pound, or about 3 hours.\n\n5368694: if you cut thawed turkey breast into cutlets, you can reduce the cook time significantly. Bake your cutlets for 20-25 minutes at 375\u00c2\u00ba F. Cooked portions will last 3-4 days in the refrigerator so you may wish to freeze some of your cooked portions if you won't be eating them ight away.\n\n8109320: To do so, defrost in the fridge for a few days before you plan on cooking. Once defrosted, or if you bought a fresh bird, take the turkey out of the refrigerator 45 minutes to 1 hour before roasting. This technique will allow the turkey to come to (almost) room temperature, helping it cook more evenly and quickly.\n\n2463758: The best way to get the turkey into the oil is to use the coat-hanger-shaped apparatus that comes with your frying rig.

An additional 30 minutes or more may be required for a stuffed turkey. Insert a fork into the thigh or breast of a turkey, if juices are clear the turkey is fully cooked. 2  Do no refreeze thawed poultry. 3  Within 2 hours of the start of your meal, all perishable foods must be refrigerated. 4  If you cook a turkey that comes with a pop-up timer, the cooking process can be almost foolproof.\n\n8174847: I cook mine at 350 for about 30 minutes but it honestly depends on they type of chicken pieces you have (breasts, thighs, legs, wings and if they have the bone in or boneless.)
