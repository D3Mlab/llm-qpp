In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) \u00e2\u0080\u0094produced by transcription from DNA \u00e2\u0080\u0094is decoded by a ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide.he ribosome molecules translate this code to a specific sequence of amino acids. The ribosome is a multisubunit structure containing rRNA and proteins. It is the factory where amino acids are assembled into proteins. tRNAs are small noncoding RNA chains (74-93 nucleotides) that transport amino acids to the ribosome.\n\n250775: During translation, these tRNAs carry amino acids to the ribosome and join with their complementary codons. Then, the assembled amino acids are joined together as the ribosome, with its resident rRNAs, moves along the mRNA molecule in a ratchet-like motion.\n\n1428081: Amino Acid. SLC: DNA codons.

Its use in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods for broad-range mutation analysis has also been described.TAE has been used at various concentrations to study the mobility of DNA in solution with and without sodium chloride.n molecular biology it is used in agarose electrophoresis typically for the separation of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. It is made up of Tris-acetate buffer, usually at pH 8.0, and EDTA, which sequesters divalent cations.\n\n8356531: Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) is a human-engineered DNA molecule used to clone DNA sequences in yeast cells. YACs are often used in connection with the mapping and sequencing of genomes. Segments of an organism's DNA, up to one million base pairs in length, can be inserted into YACs.The YACs, with their inserted DNA, are then taken up by yeast cells. As the yeast cells grow and divide, they amplify the YAC DNA, which can be isolated and used for DNA mapping and sequencing.egments of an organism's DNA, up to one million base pairs in length, can be inserted into YACs.

Urea is nontoxic, and is the primary end-product of nitrogen metabolism in mammals.\n\n4553842: Enzymes are catalysts found in nature. For example, it is the enzymes in yeast that cause bread dough to rise. When yeast is mixed with warm water and sugar it starts to grow and bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are produced. When the yeast mixture is added to flour and water to make a dough, the dough rises.n a covalent bond, electrons are shared between two atoms. When two oxygen atoms bond together to form an oxygen molecule, they share four electrons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 two from each oxygen atom. Other examples of covalent bonding are water (H 2 O), and carbon dioxide (CO 2).\n\n3101354: Pregabalin is used to treat nerve pain, epilepsy, and fibromyalgia. While it is not known exactly how the drug works to treat these conditions, it is known to bind to certain parts of calcium channels in the central nervous system.The drug is taken by mouth, usually two or three times a day.regabalin is used to treat nerve pain, epilepsy, and fibromyalgia.

The drug is taken by mouth, usually two or three times a day.\n\n3079993: DNA helicase is an enzyme that unwinds the DNA double helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases. It's easy to remember the name because it has part of the word helix in it. You can imagine it sort of as a wedge that forces apart the two strands, just like the slider on a zipper wedges apart the two long rows of teeth.\n\n119002: Polymyxin B and trimethoprim ophthalmic (for use in the eyes) is a combination medicine used to treat eye infections caused by bacteria. Polymyxin B and trimethoprim ophthalmic may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n\n1019978: Home > Terms > English (EN) > therapeutic substitution. therapeutic substitution.

You have to log in to vote.\n\n7675050: Restriction enzymes are DNA-cutting enzymes found in bacteria (and harvested from them for use). Because they cut within the molecule, they are often called restriction endonucleases. In order to be able to sequence DNA, it is first necessary to cut it into smaller fragments.his produces a heterogeneous collection of fragments of varying sizes. What is needed is a way to cleave the DNA molecule at a few precisely-located sites so that a small set of homogeneous fragments are produced.\n\n6667310: During transcription, a DNA sequence is read by an RNA polymerase, which produces a complementary, antiparallel RNA strand called a primary transcript.Transcription proceeds in the following general steps: 1  One or more sigma factor protein binds to the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, allowing it to bind to promoter DNA.uring transcription, a DNA sequence is read by an RNA polymerase, which produces a complementary, antiparallel RNA strand called a primary transcript.\n\n6628128: Role of enzymes in metabolism. Some enzymes help to break down large nutrient molecules, such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, into smaller molecules. This process occurs during the digestion of foodstuffs in the stomach and intestines of animals. Other enzymes guide the smaller, broken-down molecules through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream.\n\n7303059: by Kaushik Das.

In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) \u00e2\u0080\u0094produced by transcription from DNA \u00e2\u0080\u0094is decoded by a ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide.he ribosome molecules translate this code to a specific sequence of amino acids. The ribosome is a multisubunit structure containing rRNA and proteins. It is the factory where amino acids are assembled into proteins. tRNAs are small noncoding RNA chains (74-93 nucleotides) that transport amino acids to the ribosome.\n\n250775: During translation, these tRNAs carry amino acids to the ribosome and join with their complementary codons.

In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) \u00e2\u0080\u0094produced by transcription from DNA \u00e2\u0080\u0094is decoded by a ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide.he ribosome molecules translate this code to a specific sequence of amino acids. The ribosome is a multisubunit structure containing rRNA and proteins. It is the factory where amino acids are assembled into proteins. tRNAs are small noncoding RNA chains (74-93 nucleotides) that transport amino acids to the ribosome.\n\n250775: During translation, these tRNAs carry amino acids to the ribosome and join with their complementary codons.
