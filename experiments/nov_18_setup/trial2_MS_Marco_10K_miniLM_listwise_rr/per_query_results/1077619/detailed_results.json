Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: will marijuana be legalized\n\nDocuments:\n\n7931299: Researchers found that while most respondents said they saw marijuana legalization as inevitable, nearly a third of those surveyed said it would never happen. Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images. A majority of U.S. adults believe marijuana will be legal nationwide within the two decades. Pictured, a supporter of marijuana legalization waved a sign in support of Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf in Pittsburgh, Oct. 8, 2014. Photo: Reuters.\n\n2636399: No. The law is focused on legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. The law modifies the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarijuana\u00e2\u0080\u009d to include only cannabis greater than 0.3 percent THC concentration. Cannabis under this limit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 industrial hemp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is not treated as recreational \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarijuana.\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n8627195: In fact, most drug users begin with alcohol and nicotine before marijuana \u00e2\u0080\u0094 usually before they are of legal age. In the sense that marijuana use typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use, it is indeed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgateway\u00e2\u0080\u009d drug. But because underage smoking and alcohol use typically precede marijuana use, marijuana is not the most common, and is rarely the first, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgateway\u00e2\u0080\u009d to illicit drug use. There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs.\n\n981417: The most potent form of marijuana is hash oil which usually contains 30 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 90% THC. The strongest type of hash oil is called budder, which has been known to c new\n\n2471934: Smoking is legal for people of certain age. The legal age varies from country to country. It is considered illegal for a person under age 18 to smoke while it is legal to purchase a cigarette in Australia at that age. Again there is no restriction for consuming tobacco by those less than 18 years. Some of the natural herbs are present which are used for smoking. These herbs are considered as exotic, potent and legal. Smoking is legal as the government makes money due to the taxes levied on the cigarettes. So, the government is getting benefit out of the profits in the tobacco dealings due to the addiction of people to cigarettes.\n\n5093270: Its all good tho dude. Marijuana and weed are the same ****. just like bud and ganja. but no one uses ''marijuana cuz that word is just way to long. mostly old folks use it. dope was once marijuana. people in probably the 60's i wanna say use the word dope insttead of marijuana. but nowadays dope is heroine.\n\n8756826: Initiative 502\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Impact on the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board. Summary. Initiative 502 licenses and regulates marijuana production, distribution, and possession for persons over 21; remove state-law criminal and civil penalties for activities that it authorizes. It taxes marijuana sales and earmarks marijuana-related revenues.\n\n3087943: Do you know that marijuana is a powerful aphrodisiac? With cannabis-flavored condoms, sex can be more enjoyable and exciting. If you have never used them before, the best experience in your life is still to come. According to the manufacturer, the product inspired by marijuana is green and tastes and smells like the real plant.\n\n208859: Yes. Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that are harmful to both smokers and nonsmokers. Breathing even a little tobacco smoke can be harmful. Of the 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, at least 250 are known to be harmful.he toxic chemicals found in smoke include hydrogen cyanide (used in chemical weapons), carbon monoxide (found in car exhaust), formaldehyde (used as an embalming fluid), ammonia (used in household cleaners), and toluene (found in paint thinners).\n\n5157177: Active. Active hydroponic weed systems move the nutrient solution to the plant using mechanical devices. As a fast growing plant, marijuana thrives in an active system and with a little experience and a good nutrient schedule, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to grow impressive amounts of weed.hen mixing nutrients for your hydro grow, you should always add them to your water and never the other way around. Adding water to nutrients can cause them to lock up and could lead to your plant starving to death.\n\n2901411: Image 1 of 31 - 15 marijuana strains good for insomnia.

Here's how Leafly.com describes the effects of this strain, based on user submissions: Afgoo is an indica-dominant strain that has a sweet and piney scent. If you are looking for a good night's rest then afgoo could be for you.\n\n7438331: The small group is part of Nevada's efforts to understand what legalization could mean. The Silver State has permitted medical marijuana, and now there's talk voters might be asked to legalize recreational pot next year.\n\n8211297: It would certainly seem odd to hold that it does not, given that the Constitution sets forth the highest law of the land. Suppose, however, that the Founders meant to treat quartering as a special class of takings. In this case, the Third Amendment would demand more and less than the Fifth Amendment.\n\n266423: CHS is a very rare syndrome and is easily cured by stopping the consumption of cannabis. This should not, by any means, hurt marijuana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation for being the safest recreational drug around, but people need to be aware of the syndrome\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence.\n\n1300291: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was just so easy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 really smooth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d. After the party, he promptly went online to buy one of the $250 devices, and started using it regularly, even going on a bit of a pot bender with it, after 40 years of smoking from traditional joints and pipes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was like Christmas morning for a few months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. The filmmaker is far from alone: John Smith, manager of Smoking Culture on West Fourth Street in the Village, estimates his shop sells 50 to 100 vaporizers a week, making them the second most popular item after regular hand-blown glass bowls.\n\n4977030: Unlike THC, CBD does not cause a high. While this makes CBD a poor choice for recreational users, it gives the chemical a significant advantage as a medicine, since health professionals prefer treatments with minimal side effects. CBD is non-psychoactive because it does not act on the same pathways as THC. These pathways, called CB1 receptors, are highly concentrated in the brain and are responsible for the mind-altering effects of THC.\n\n136727: Like traditional cigarettes, vaporizers that contain nicotine raise the user's heart rate and blood pressure as an adrenaline rush overcomes the body, however, a European study found 'none of the heart problems associated with tobacco cigarettes among e-cigarette' users. Vaping may also be addictive.\n\n3103731: The big picture: It is now perfectly legal to carry a concealed firearm in public everywhere in the country except for Washington, D.C., with varying restrictions on who exactly is allowed to carry and where he or she can do so.\n\n1555458: At the Supreme Court, the town characterizes the case as an easy one that the Court can resolve based just on Marsh v. Chambers, which allows legislative prayers as long as you are not trying to proselytize or denounce another religion, and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t discriminate in whom you choose to deliver the prayer.t the Supreme Court, the town characterizes the case as an easy one that the Court can resolve based just on Marsh v.

Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images. A majority of U.S. adults believe marijuana will be legal nationwide within the two decades. Pictured, a supporter of marijuana legalization waved a sign in support of Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf in Pittsburgh, Oct. 8, 2014. Photo: Reuters.\n\n2636399: No. The law is focused on legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. The law modifies the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarijuana\u00e2\u0080\u009d to include only cannabis greater than 0.3 percent THC concentration. Cannabis under this limit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 industrial hemp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is not treated as recreational \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarijuana.\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n8627195: In fact, most drug users begin with alcohol and nicotine before marijuana \u00e2\u0080\u0094 usually before they are of legal age. In the sense that marijuana use typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use, it is indeed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgateway\u00e2\u0080\u009d drug. But because underage smoking and alcohol use typically precede marijuana use, marijuana is not the most common, and is rarely the first, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgateway\u00e2\u0080\u009d to illicit drug use. There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs.\n\n981417: The most potent form of marijuana is hash oil which usually contains 30 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 90% THC. The strongest type of hash oil is called budder, which has been known to c new\n\n2471934: Smoking is legal for people of certain age. The legal age varies from country to country. It is considered illegal for a person under age 18 to smoke while it is legal to purchase a cigarette in Australia at that age. Again there is no restriction for consuming tobacco by those less than 18 years. Some of the natural herbs are present which are used for smoking. These herbs are considered as exotic, potent and legal. Smoking is legal as the government makes money due to the taxes levied on the cigarettes. So, the government is getting benefit out of the profits in the tobacco dealings due to the addiction of people to cigarettes.\n\n5093270: Its all good tho dude. Marijuana and weed are the same ****. just like bud and ganja. but no one uses ''marijuana cuz that word is just way to long. mostly old folks use it. dope was once marijuana. people in probably the 60's i wanna say use the word dope insttead of marijuana. but nowadays dope is heroine.\n\n8756826: Initiative 502\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Impact on the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board. Summary. Initiative 502 licenses and regulates marijuana production, distribution, and possession for persons over 21; remove state-law criminal and civil penalties for activities that it authorizes. It taxes marijuana sales and earmarks marijuana-related revenues.\n\n3087943: Do you know that marijuana is a powerful aphrodisiac? With cannabis-flavored condoms, sex can be more enjoyable and exciting. If you have never used them before, the best experience in your life is still to come. According to the manufacturer, the product inspired by marijuana is green and tastes and smells like the real plant.\n\n208859: Yes. Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that are harmful to both smokers and nonsmokers. Breathing even a little tobacco smoke can be harmful. Of the 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, at least 250 are known to be harmful.he toxic chemicals found in smoke include hydrogen cyanide (used in chemical weapons), carbon monoxide (found in car exhaust), formaldehyde (used as an embalming fluid), ammonia (used in household cleaners), and toluene (found in paint thinners).\n\n5157177: Active. Active hydroponic weed systems move the nutrient solution to the plant using mechanical devices. As a fast growing plant, marijuana thrives in an active system and with a little experience and a good nutrient schedule, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to grow impressive amounts of weed.hen mixing nutrients for your hydro grow, you should always add them to your water and never the other way around. Adding water to nutrients can cause them to lock up and could lead to your plant starving to death.\n\n2901411: Image 1 of 31 - 15 marijuana strains good for insomnia.
