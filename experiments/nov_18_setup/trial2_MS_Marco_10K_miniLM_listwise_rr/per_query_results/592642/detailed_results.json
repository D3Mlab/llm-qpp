Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: what causes the immune system to fail\n\nDocuments:\n\n704341: An autoimmune disease is different in that the immune system is attacking \u00e2\u0080\u009cself\u00e2\u0080\u009d - parts of you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an immune system gone awry. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no organ or bodily system excluded from potential attack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour finest weapon can become your greatest enemy. For example in multiple sclerosis the immune system is attacking the myelin sheath. 2  In rheumatoid arthritis the immune system is attacking the synovial membrane between the joints. 3  The immune system can attack any organ or any system. 4  Autoimmune diseases are the fourth leading cause of disability among women.\n\n7471105: The fourth and least common, a lack of nutrients can be both a reason by itself and a cause for the other three. Sometimes the immune system just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough building blocks to work with or electrolytes (minerals) to conduct a frequency correction. Wireless Healing\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 can determine if this is the case. Anyone of these four reasons or flaws will keep the Operating System from doing its job of getting you well.\n\n102914: Immune System Boosters. Feeding your body certain foods may help to keep your immune system running strong. Plan your meals to include the following 10 powerful immune system boosters and you may increase your family's chances of fending off those winter bugs before they get anyone sick.\n\n6731555: Causes of pelvic inflammatory disease. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is caused by an infection developing in the female upper genital tract. In most cases, the condition is caused by a bacterial infection spreading from the vagina or cervix (entrance to the womb) into the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries. PID is often caused by more than one type of bacterium and it can sometimes be difficult for doctors to pinpoint which are responsible.\n\n8631815: When you have a kidney transplant, the new kidney is \u00e2\u0080\u009cforeign\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your body. Your body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune system fights off or destroys (rejects) anything foreign to keep it running smooth. Because of this, you will take immunosuppressive medications for the rest of your life to prevent your body from rejecting your kidney. Rejection comes in several forms: Hyperacute rejection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Because of crossmatching prior to the transplant, this is a very rare form of rejection. It is when the body immediately destroys the transplanted kidney. Acute rejection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Usually occurrs in the first few months after transplant, but it can happen at any time after the transplant.\n\n5292495: Research the causes of these diseases that are similar to, or related to, Autoimmune Urticaria: 1  Idiopathic urticaria without angioedema. 2  Chronic urticaria. 3  Occult infection (e.g., sinusitis, oral infection, cholecystitis, vaginitis, prostatitis, hepatitis, HIV, tinea manus or pedis).4  Malignancy.5  Thyroid disease.esearch the causes of these diseases that are similar to, or related to, Autoimmune Urticaria: 1  Idiopathic urticaria without angioedema. 2  Chronic urticaria. 3  Occult infection (e.g., sinusitis, oral infection, cholecystitis, vaginitis, prostatitis, hepatitis, HIV, tinea manus or pedis). 4  Malignancy. 5  Thyroid disease.\n\n7342551: Tacrolimus lowers your body's immune system. The immune system helps your body fight infections. The immune system can also fight or reject a transplanted organ such as a liver or kidney. This is because the immune system treats the new organ as an invader.\n\n1082285: Failure to adequately wash hands is a major cause of infectious diseases. Individuals who practice poor personal hygiene while preparing food may spread diseases such as hepatitis A, salmonellosis, and shigellosis. Studies indicate that onethird (33%) of people do not wash their hands after using the restroom.\n\n6565887: EPSTEIN\u00e2\u0080\u0093BARR VIRUS & the immune defense system Epstein\u00e2\u0080\u0093Barr Virus (EBV) is a common human virus that causes reactivation usually occurs without symptoms of illness. EBV also establishes a lifelong dormant infection in some cells of the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune system.\n\n7517269: Congestive Heart Failure can be caused by: 1  Diseases that weaken the heart muscle. 2  Diseases that cause stiffening of the heart muscles.  Diseases that increase oxygen demand by the body tissue beyond the capability of the heart to deliver adequate oxygen-rich blood.\n\n6089667: Pathogens cause disease. A pathogen (disease-causing agent) is a microorganism that causes disease in its host (human, animals, plant, another microorganism).Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and a newly discovered class of pathogens prions. pathogen (disease-causing agent) is a microorganism that causes disease in its host (human, animals, plant, another microorganism).\n\n7626349: Inherited kidney diseases such as polycystic kidney disease as well as diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of kidney failure requiring transplant. If left untreated, kidney failure can be fatal. Prior to transplant, most patients require dialysis, a mechanical treatment to filter the blood to rid your body of harmful wastes, extra salt and water. While most people are born with two kidneys, we can survive with one.\n\n464837: Depending on the infection, the body can be affected minimally or severely. In a viral cold infection, the body may feel general discomfort and illness for a short period of time. The Epstein-Barr viral infection, however, can cause the body to become extremely exhausted, which can last for months in some cases. Other infections can cause fevers, pain, and weight loss. Be sure to see your doctor if you have any infection that is bothersome or persistent, or if you don't know what it is.\n\n3553796: The exact cause of inflammatory bowel disease remains unknown. Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate but don't cause IBD. One possible cause is an immune system malfunction.\n\n7404462: A. When Addison's disease is the result of a problem with the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency), the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the adrenal glands. This autoimmune assault destroys the outer layer of the glands. This happens in 70% of Addison cases.\n\n8001447: A few people will have a longer window period, so if you get a negative antibody test result in the first 3 months after possible exposure, you should get a repeat test after 3 months. Ninety-seven percent of people will develop antibodies in the first 3 months after they are infected.\n\n280750: TB (Tuberculosis) under a microscope! 1  TB can infect any part of the body. 2  TB can remain in a latent state for periods of time. 3  Coughing and sneezing are the most common cause of TB transmission.  Typically, TB targets the lungs and 1  throat. During the latency period, the TB-resistant host is not contagious.\n\n6123241: Causes of intertrigo. Intertrigo affects the upper part of folded skin and is caused by moisture, fungi, or bacteria in the skin folds. This condition is common in areas that are warm with moist climates. Intertrigo can also occur when there is no infection, for instance, when the area becomes inflamed. The areas of skin folds will rub against each other and cause irritation and wearing out of skin, which could result in inflammation.\n\n2820500: A) The immune system does not appear until the preteen years. B) The thymus is so active in children that it fights bacteria so hard that it produces strong. symptoms of disease. C) Because of their small size, children's bodies cannot contain as much lymphoid tissue as those. of adults.\n\n8199150: Why is Low Body Temperature Important? The body's enzymatic processes slow over 10%, sometimes 20% per degree of temperature below optimum. Slower chemical function, repair, and disposal of local and environmental toxins puts the body below expected function.This can cause many syndromes and symptoms, such as those listed below.he body's enzymatic processes slow over 10%, sometimes 20% per degree of temperature below optimum. Slower chemical function, repair, and disposal of local and environmental toxins puts the body below expected function. This can cause many syndromes and symptoms, such as those listed below.\n\n6757562: Atrial fibrillation is often referred to as sick sinus syndrome because the sinoatrial (sinus) node in the right atrium controls the electrical impulses. The cause of atrial fibrillation is not always known. Conditions that can cause damage to the heart and lead to atrial fibrillation include: 1  high blood pressure.  congestive heart failure.\n\n7687312: Sickle cell anemia is hereditary. It affects their hemoglobin molecules, they have a different shape that causes the Red Blood Cell to distort into a sickled shape. The proble \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 m with the hemoglobin as well as the shape issue causes oxygen problems in the body. 7 people found this useful.\n\n1724235: There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including: 1  pernicious anaemia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.here are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including: 1  pernicious anaemia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.\n\n3431185: Infections from bacterial invasion can cause loss of appetite and nausea. Loss of appetite and nausea are common symptoms that affect everyone at some point. The symptoms of lack of appetite and nausea are often non-specific can occur as a result of a variety of conditions. The most common causes of nausea and lack of appetite are conditions that affect the gastrointestinal tract, although systemic infections may also be the culprit.\n\n4768858: antibody. an immunoglobulin molecule having a specific amino acid sequence that gives each antibody the ability to adhere to and interact only with the antigen that induced its synthesis. This antigen-specific property of the antibody is the basis of the antigen-antibody reaction that is essential to an immune response.ntibody production, its interaction with a specific antigen, and the activation of complement (C), an interrelated group of eleven proteins, are the major components of the humoral system of immunity.\n\n3255503: If the red blood cells are fragmented (broken) into smaller parts, this can cause the RDW to be high and the MCV to be low. In this situation, the red blood cells vary in size\n\n1401259: There are two types of African trypanosomiasis (also called sleeping sickness); each is named for the region of Africa in which they were found historically. East African trypanosomiasis is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, which is carried by the tsetse fly.Each year, a few hundred cases of East African trypanosomiasis are reported to the World Health Organization. person will get East African trypanosomiasis if he or she is bitten by a tsetse fly infected with the Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense parasite. The proportion of tsetse flies that are infected with this parasite is low.\n\n409710: Discussion of antibodies. 1  cell-mediated immunity (CMI). 2  T cells (lymphocytes) bind to the surface of other cells that display the antigen and trigger a response. 3  The response may involve. T cells (lymphocytes) bind to the surface of other cells that display the antigen and trigger a response. 2  The response may involve. 3  other lymphocytes and. 4  any of the other white blood cells (leukocytes).\n\n8533341: Four basic types of hard drive failures: 1  Software or firmware damage may cause the disk to become unreadable, resulting in the inability to interact properly with the computer. 2  Problems with the controller board on the hard disk may result in electronic failure.\n\n6799352: For chronic prostatitis, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers believe: a microorganism can cause chronic prostatitis; your immune system is responding to a previous UTI; your immune system is reacting to nerve damage in the area; For acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, bacterial infections are the cause. Sometimes, bacteria can get into the prostate through the urethra. You are at increased risk of prostate infection if you use a catheter or have a medical procedure involving the urethra.\n\n821959: As in other autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural ability to attack invading viruses and bacteria goes haywire and mistakenly sees healthy body proteins as enemies. Redness, pain, heat and swelling signal that the immune system is on the warpath.\n\n8077207: Causes of upper GI bleeding. Peptic ulcers are a common cause of GI bleeding. These ulcers are open sores that develop in the lining of your stomach or duodenum. An infection from H. pylori bacteria usually causes peptic ulcers. Also, enlarged veins in your esophagus can tear and bleed as a result of a condition called esophageal varices. Tears in the walls of your esophagus can also cause GI bleeding. This condition is known as Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Causes of lower GI bleeding. One of the most common causes of lower GI bleeding is colitis, which occurs when your colon becomes inflamed. Colitis has multiple causes, including: infection. food poisoning; parasites; Crohn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease or ulcerative colitis; reduced blood flow in the colon\n\n205918: Some Illnesses Cause Fatigue. Feeling fatigued can be like an alarm going off in your body. It may be the first sign that something is wrong. But, fatigue itself is not a disease. For example, many older people live with rheumatoid arthritis, a painful condition that affects the joints, usually in hands or feet.\n\n462359: 10 Common Digestive Disorders. The spleen is part of the lymphatic system, which plays a role in immunity and maintenance of healthy blood cells. It is an important organ and is affected by disorders of the blood, liver, and immune system. An enlarged spleen is known as splenomegaly. Although hepatosplenomegaly often produces no symptoms, it is known to cause abdominal pain in the upper portion of your abdomen.\n\n2073388: Galactosemia I and II are treated by removing galactose from the diet. Since galactose is a breakdown product of lactose, the primary sugar constituent of milk, this means all milk and foods containing milk products must be totally eliminated.alactosemia iii. Galactosemia III is caused by defects in the gene that codes for an enzyme called uridyl diphosphogalactose-4-epimerase (GALE). This form of galactosemia is very rare. There are two forms of galactosemia III, a severe form, which is exceedingly rare, and a benign form.\n\n4985599: C. immitis can cause a disease called coccidioidomycosis or (valley fever. Its incubation period varies from 7 to 21 days. Coccidioidomycosis is not easily diagnosed on the basis of vital signs and symptoms, which are usually vague and nonspecific.occidioides immitis is a pathogenic fungus that resides in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and a few other areas in the Western Hemisphere. Contents.\n\n1435261: DESCRIPTION: When someone develops an autoimmune disorder their body produces antibodies to healthy organs and attacks them as if they were a disease. The antibodies that are produced to fight a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own cells can be measured in the blood using the ANA or antinuclear antibodies with Reflex Test.ESCRIPTION: When someone develops an autoimmune disorder their body produces antibodies to healthy organs and attacks them as if they were a disease. The antibodies that are produced to fight a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own cells can be measured in the blood using the ANA or antinuclear antibodies with Reflex Test.\n\n1417450: Genetic Changes. Mutations in the NF1 gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1. The NF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin. This protein is produced in many cells, including nerve cells and specialized cells surrounding nerves (oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells).\n\n3174268: When cells become resistant to insulin, insulin is unable to take sugar from the blood stream to the cells to use for energy, and instead the sugar remains in the blood. As a result, the liver responds by making more sugar because it thinks the body needs it for fuel and the pancreas responds by making more insulin.\n\n7666629: Blood sugar then drops or plummets, causing the adrenals to work to bring levels back up. When you are suffering from fatigued adrenal glands, cortisol levels drop and make it difficult to maintain normal blood sugar levels. People with adrenal fatigue tend to have low blood sugar.\n\n3103902: Patient Comments Read 6 Comments Share Your Story. 1  An allergic reaction is the body's way of responding to an invader.. 2  When the body senses a foreign substance, called an antigen, the immune system is triggered.\n\n1000360: How It Works. T cells, a type of immune cell, are present with receptors on their surface, called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. Typically these TCRs bind to antigens to mount an immune response. In an attempt to use T cells for cancer therapy, T cells are collected from a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own blood.\n\n1485445: List of causes of Hypotension. Following is a list of causes or underlying conditions (see also Misdiagnosis of underlying causes of Hypotension) that could possibly cause Hypotension includes: Pulmonary embolism. Heart failure.\n\n7048349: Dioxin poisoning may cause the kidneys to shut down. Organ failure may occur as a result of dioxin poisoning. Dioxins may be present in certain herbicides. Compounds like agent orange may cause cancer and heart problems, although these conditions may not be diagnosed until years after exposure.\n\n6960036: Ineffective elimination can be hormonal (in aldosterone deficiency) or due to causes in the renal parenchyma that impair excretion. Increased extracellular potassium levels result in depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells due to the increase in the equilibrium potential of potassium.\n\n6973040: A low ferritin level is the most common nutritional cause of hair loss in women. Iron is essential for good follicle health. Ferritin is the name given to the iron that is stored in the body cells. It's different from the iron we have in our blood cells, known as haemoglobin. Scroll down for more.\n\n2495951: Hemoglobin in the RBCs becomes full of oxygen when moving through the lungs. This oxygen is released and distributed as the RBCs move through the capillaries into tissues and organs. If hemoglobin is low tissues will not receive enough oxygen causing poor healing and can create an excess workload on the heart. Red blood cells are produced by the bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 120 days. An RBC count that is too high or too low can both cause health problems.\n\n6734187: The noun virulence derives from the adjective virulent. Virulent can describe either disease severity or a pathogen's infectivity. The word virulent derives from the Latin word virulentus, meaning a poisoned wound or full of poison..In an ecological context, virulence can be defined as the host's parasite-induced loss of fitness.irulent bacteria [edit]. The ability of bacteria to cause disease is described in terms of the number of infecting bacteria, the route of entry into the body, the effects of host defense mechanisms, and intrinsic characteristics of the bacteria called virulence factors.\n\n1418804: The extent of the hair loss varies; in some cases, it is only in a few spots. In others, the hair loss can be greater. On rare occasions, the person loses all of the hair on his or her head (alopecia areata totalis) or entire body (alopecia areata universalis). It is believed that the person's genetic makeup may trigger the autoimmune reaction of alopecia areata, along with a virus or a substance the person comes into contact with. Alopecia areata is an unpredictable disease. In some people ...\n\n2032793: What causes dumping syndrome? For those who have undergone gastric surgery, it can be hard to regulate the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Eating certain foods such as those with refined sugars, which quickly absorb water, may cause symptoms.\n\n3965162: 1 Cold shock proteins help the cell to survive in temperatures lower than optimum growth temperature.  Heat shock proteins help the cell to survive in temperatures greater than the optimum, possibly by condensation of the chromosome and organization of the prokaryotic nucleoid.\n\n2337291: 1 Associated autoimmune or collagen vascular diseases. 2  Exposure to medications or toxins such as asbestos, tobacco smoke, or environmental toxins. 3  Associated genetic diseases. 4  The cause is not known (idiopathic).

Inflammation is another common symptom that causes stiffness, or arthritis, in the hands and feet, wrists, knees, and ankles.\n\n3843904: Why COPD Emphysema Symptoms arise? COPD patients show the symptoms of disease due to inflamed and infected alveoli inside lungs. The pulmonary system gets damaged due to regular smoking and addition of toxins on the lung area. The condition of COPD might get chronic with time as the disease is incurable.\n\n1938982: Anemia Treatment for Iron Deficiency. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. If your blood is low in iron, it can't make hemoglobin. Typical causes of iron-deficiency anemia are a diet low in iron, your body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inability to absorb iron, or blood loss. Children and women of childbearing age are especially susceptible.\n\n898340: 1. Testing To Early. One of the most common reasons for a false negative result is testing too early. In order for a pregnancy test to show accurate results, you have to give your body time to produce the levels of hcg (pregnancy hormone) that the pregnancy test needs in order to trigger a positive result.\n\n8779475: Causes of Unstable Angina: Blood clots that block an artery partially or totally are what causes unstable angina. Blood clots may form, partially dissolve, and later form again and angina can occur each time a clot blocks blood flow in an artery.Learn more about excessive blood clotting. Symptoms of Unstable Angina-The pain or discomfort: 1  Often occurs while you may be resting, sleeping, or with little physical exertion.reatment for Unstable Angina First, your healthcare provider will need to find the blocked part or parts of the coronary arteries by performing a cardiac catheterization.\n\n6050990: Recommend on Facebook Tweet ShareCompartir. Shigellosis is an infectious disease caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella (shih-GEHL-uh). Most who are infected with Shigella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are exposed to the bacteria.\n\n2225033: 1 The symptoms of type 2 VWD are often more severe than type 1, but milder than type 3. 2  Type 3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 People with this rare type have very low levels of Von Willebrand factor in their blood, or none at all. 3  This causes problems similar to haemophilia.\n\n4699975: COEVOLUTION. First some definitions: coevolution is a change in the genetic composition of one species (or group) in response to a genetic change in another. More generally, the idea of some reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species is a strict definition of coevolution.hus presence of a parasite on a host does not constitute evidence for coevolution. These criticisms are quite distinct from the opportunity for coevolution once a parasite has established itself on a host. The main point is that any old interaction, symbiosis, mutualism, etc. is. with coevolution.\n\n4700805: In cases where diabetes has damaged the vagus nerve, it can cause gastroparesis, a condition wherein the muscles of the stomach and intestine are not able to efficiently move food through the gastrointestinal system.\n\n485185: Signs You May Have an Iron Deficiency. In women, the number-one cause of iron deficiency is too-heavy periods, says Jacques Moritz, MD, director of gynecology at Mount Sinai St. Luke's Roosevelt in New York City. They lose too much blood, replace about half of it, and then lose too much again the following month, he says.\n\n8168012: Notes. \u00e2\u0086\u0091 1  Paulhus, D.L., Fridhandler B., & Hayes S.

Other childhood viral infections such as chickenpox, measles, rubella, herpes, and mono can cause pneumonia directly. Viral pneumonias are fairly common. They peak during the toddler years, and become a bit less common each year. Bacterial pneumonias are less common. Most occur in children with cystic fibrosis or an underlying immune problem. All children who get two or more pneumonias within one year should have their immune system and lung anatomy evaluated by their doctor, to ensure they have no underlying illness putting them at greater risk for pneumonias. What are the symptoms?\n\n3135246: More than 25 mutations in the RET gene are known to cause a form of multiple endocrine neoplasia called type 2. Multiple endocrine neoplasia typically involves the development of tumors in two or more of the body's hormone-producing glands, called endocrine glands. These tumors can be noncancerous or cancerous.\n\n4737599: A parasitic disease is an infectious disease caused or transmitted by a parasite. Many parasites do not cause diseases. Parasitic diseases can affect practically all living organisms, including plants and mammals. The study of parasitic diseases is called parasitology.The share of parasitic diseases account for about 14 000 000 deaths per year, representing 25% of global mortality-one in four deaths according to the WHO.arasitic diseases can affect practically all living organisms, including plants and mammals.

The preschool specialist at the Department of Education states that all preschool special education students must have a physical and age appropriate immunizations in order to attend school.\n\n3808689: The 6 Big Reasons Why Estrogen Dominance (Low Progesterone) Can Greatly Inhibit Your Ability to Lose Weight & Keep it Off: 1  Excessive Estrogen Turns More Calories Into Fat. 2  Progesterone Helps Your Thyroid Hormones Function More Efficiently. 3  Progesterone Lowers Insulin Levels. 4  Progesterone is a Natural Anti-Inflammatory.\n\n5288980: A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a birth defect of the heart in which there is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the two lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart.This wall also is called the ventricular septum.lick here to view a larger image. A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a birth defect of the heart in which there is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the two lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. This wall also is called the ventricular septum.\n\n4518293: Mastocytosis (say mass-toe-sigh-toe-sis) is the abnormal growth of mast cells in the body. Mast cells are part of the immune system, which helps protect your body against infection. The most common form of mastocytosis is when mast cells accumulate on the skin, causing reddish-brown spots or bumps.In rare cases, mastocytosis can affect other parts of the body, such as the stomach, the intestines and the bone marrow. Mastocytosis can occur in people of any age.he most common form of mastocytosis is when mast cells accumulate on the skin, causing reddish-brown spots or bumps. In rare cases, mastocytosis can affect other parts of the body, such as the stomach, the intestines and the bone marrow. Mastocytosis can occur in people of any age.\n\n1876803: In most cases of Bell's palsy, the nerve that controls muscles on one side of the face is damaged by inflammation. Many health problems can cause weakness or paralysis of the face. If a specific reason cannot be found for the weakness, the condition is called Bell's palsy.\n\n2281512: 1 Hepatitis A (hep A) - The hep A virus can cause liver failure. 2  Children should get 2 doses of the vaccine starting at age 1. 3  Varicella (chickenpox) - Kids need two doses, spaced out about 4-5 years. 4  Influenza (flu) - The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months of age and older get this vaccine every year.\n\n2461267: DPT vaccine. The DPT vaccine is one type of preventive medicine called immunization (to make things resistant to disease). The vaccine causes the body to form protective antibodies (disease-fighting proteins) against three serious diseases: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus (lockjaw).\n\n3220374: The list below shows some of the causes of Kayser-Fleischer ring mentioned in various sources: 1  Ceruloplasmin deficiency. 2  Cholestasis. 3  Chronic copper poisoning. 4  Cryptogenic cirrhosis. 5  Primary biliary cirrhosis - Kayser-Fleischer rings. 6  more causes...\u00c2\u00bb.\n\n7004795: Dr. Martin Raff Dr. Raff. 1  Proteus Syndrome: Proteus syndrome, also known as wiedemann syndrome (named after the german paediatrician hans-rudolf wiedemann), is a congenital disorder that causes skin overgrowth and atypical bone development, often accompanied by tumors over half the body.\n\n1040062: AdreneVive 60 capsules. Stress can cause overstimulation to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This axis is incredibly important for every aspect of your health, as it helps to control many systems within the body, including the hormonal and neural systems. When the HPA is out of balance, this causes secondary damage due to the lowering of the immune system.\n\n6904333: Zinc is a trace mineral - needed in only small amounts by our bodies but with many important functions. Zinc deficiency can cause loss of appetite, poor growth, loss of hair, a poorly functioning immune system (leading to constant illness), poor wound healing and changes in taste sensation. RDI*.\n\n8460230: 01, 2017. Age is the most common cause of macular pucker. As you get older, the vitreous begins to shrink and pull away from the retina. Usually the vitreous pulls away with no problems. But sometimes the vitreous can stick to the retina. Scar tissue forms, causing the retina and macula to wrinkle or bulge.\n\n8177632: White blood cells are infection-fighting cells produced in the bone marrow. When a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil is lowered in the body -- a condition called neutropenia -- the immune system is weakened and a person becomes vulnerable to infections.\n\n1819985: Potential categories of causes (see Table: Some Common Causes of Fever in Children) include localized or generalized infection, connective tissue disease, and cancer. Miscellaneous specific causes include inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes insipidus with dehydration, and disordered thermoregulation.\n\n3739826: Sarcoidosis. An inflammatory disease marked by the formation of granulomas (small nodules of immune cells) in the lungs, lymph nodes, and other organs. Sarcoidosis may be acute and go away by itself, or it may be chronic and progressive. Also called sarcoid.\n\n3364605: Pneumonia is diagnosed through signs and symptoms and, sometimes, a chest X-ray. In HIV-positive people with a strong immune system, signs and symptoms are similar to those seen in HIV-negative people: fever, trouble breathing, cough that produces green or yellow sputum, and possibly chest pain.nfections appear with severe suppression of the immune system; about 90% of cases occur in people with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm 3. PCP is seared into the collective memory of the HIV community in the resource-rich world because it was such a common and fatal condition early in the epidemic.\n\n6820053: Immunoglobulin (also called gamma globulin or immune globulin) is a substance made from human blood plasma. The plasma, processed from donated human blood, contains antibodies that protect the body against diseases. When you are given an immunoglobulin, your body uses antibodies from other people's blood plasma to help prevent illness.\n\n4694035: About half of those who have mononucleosis have enlargement of the spleen, usually 2 to 3 weeks after they are infected. The incubation period\u00e2\u0080\u0094the time it takes symptoms to appear after a person becomes infected with the virus\u00e2\u0080\u0094can be 4 to 6 weeks.Symptoms of mononucleosis usually last for 1 to 4 weeks, but it might take as long as 2 months before you feel well enough to resume all of your normal activities.he most common symptoms of mononucleosis are fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands in the neck, under the arms, and in the groin area. Other symptoms include the following: 1  fatigue. 2  muscle aches or weakness.\n\n1554406: Eukaryotic pathogens. Parasitism is a dominant mode of life on the planet, and parasitic metazoan and protozoan eukaryotes cause some of the most damaging and intractable diseases of both man and his domestic animals.\n\n5885302: Although CD4 does not stabilize TCR\u00e2\u0080\u0093pMHC interactions (9, 13, 14), like CD8, it does enhance T-cell responses (1, 9). This result raises the question of whether CD4 can enhance Lck recruitment to the TCR complex and, more generally, whether CD4 and CD8 enhance T-cell sensitivity to antigen in different ways.\n\n3277725: Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a chronic skin disease that causes loss of pigment, resulting in irregular pale or white patches of skin. Common areas of the skin losing pigment are the face, lips, hands, arms, legs, and genital areas. Vitiligo occurs when the melanocytes die or are unable to function.he loss of melanocytes results in smooth, white patches in the middle of normally pigmented skin. Vitiligo, or leucoderma, is a common skin disorder, which is usually inherited, and can affect anyone anywhere. There are two main types of vitiligo patterns: segmental and non-segmental (generalized).\n\n3099421: About 95% of cases of acromegaly are caused by a benign pituitary tumor. The other 5% of cases are caused by non-pituitary tumors; those tumors, usually located in other parts of the brain, the pancreas, or the lungs, can cause the body to secrete too much growth hormone 1.\n\n7429113: Strep throat is caused by infection with Group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria, specifically Streptococcus pyogenes. The streptococcal infection invades the pharyngeal tissue and causes a localized inflammatory reaction of the throat and tonsils. These bacterial organisms are often found in the throat or on the skin, and are responsible for other illnesses as well, such as impetigo (a skin infection).\n\n2413579: Down syndrome (DS or DNS) or Down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability.own syndrome (DS or DNS) or Down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.\n\n5535520: Plant viruses cause various types of plant diseases, but the diseases do not typically result in plant death. They do however, produce symptoms such as ringspots, mosaic pattern development, leaf yellowing and distortion, as well as deformed growth.he name of the plant disease is often related to the symptoms the disease produces in the particular plant. For example, papaya leaf curl and potato leaf roll are diseases that cause specific types of leaf distortion.\n\n1782673: Prevention of TBI is the best approach since there is no cure. Mechanisms of Injury. These mechanisms are the highest causes of brain injury: Open head Injury, Closed Head Injury, Deceleration Injuries, Chemical/Toxic, Hypoxia, Tumors, Infections and Stroke. 1. Open Head Injury.\n\n7013495: Another common cause is the treatments for cancer. Radiation and chemotherapy often cause a decrease in appetite. They can also lead to side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and mouth sores, which can affect your ability to eat normally, further contributing to weight and muscle loss.\n\n1895808: Central sensitization is a condition of the nervous system that is associated with the development and maintenance of chronic pain. When central sensitization occurs, the nervous system goes through a process called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwind-up\u00e2\u0080\u009d and gets regulated in a persistent state of high reactivity.This persistent, or regulated, state of reactivity subsequently comes to maintain pain even after the initial injury might have healed.he onset of pain is often associated with subsequent development of conditions such as depression, fear-avoidance, anxiety and other stressors. The stress of these responses can, in turn, further exacerbate the reactivity of the nervous system, leading to central sensitization.\n\n8431674: Niacin, or vitamin B3, is important to proper health, but like many food components, people can develop an allergy to it. The signs and symptoms of a niacin allergy encompass a wide variety of physical problems. These can range from a simple rash to hives, trouble with blood sugar levels, and an upset stomach or ulcers. In the event a severe allergy, some individuals bleed, pass out, and even suffer from blood clots.\n\n4349039: Overstretching of the adductor tendons is a much less common cause. Failure to stretch the adductor muscles properly puts them at increased risk for injury. Weakness of the adductor muscles is a common problem that puts these muscles at increased risk for injury, as the load to failure is much less in weaker muscles.\n\n3209989: The same thing happens when you put salt water on your skin. As the water evaporates, leaving the salt behind, it attaches to the surface of infectious cells, draws the moisture out, and kills the cells. Salts help to draw out toxins, microscopic dirt, and pollutants that get into our skin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pores over time.\n\n120954: Endotoxin vs Exotoxin. Toxigenesis is the process of producing toxins by pathogenic bacteria. It is one of main mechanisms of developing diseases by bacteria. Two kinds of toxins; i.e. endotoxins and exotoxins are produced, and those can be distinguished by their chemical nature.\n\n8012858: A subsidence of the symptoms of a disease. A relapse of symptoms. Reversion to an earlier or less mature pattern of feeling or behavior. Relapse to a less perfect or developed state. The return of a population to an earlier or less complex physical type in successive generations. The relationship between the mean value of a random variable and the corresponding values of one or more independent variables. A relative fall in sea level resulting in deposition of terrestrial strata over marine strata.\n\n4192447: If the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin, or if the body cannot use the insulin properly, blood sugar levels rise and the body cannot use foods effectively. High blood sugar levels are harmful to many body tissues. Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal problem of people with diabetes.\n\n"

Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: what causes the immune system to fail\n\nDocuments:\n\n704341: An autoimmune disease is different in that the immune system is attacking \u00e2\u0080\u009cself\u00e2\u0080\u009d - parts of you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an immune system gone awry. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no organ or bodily system excluded from potential attack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour finest weapon can become your greatest enemy. For example in multiple sclerosis the immune system is attacking the myelin sheath. 2  In rheumatoid arthritis the immune system is attacking the synovial membrane between the joints. 3  The immune system can attack any organ or any system. 4  Autoimmune diseases are the fourth leading cause of disability among women.\n\n7471105: The fourth and least common, a lack of nutrients can be both a reason by itself and a cause for the other three. Sometimes the immune system just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough building blocks to work with or electrolytes (minerals) to conduct a frequency correction. Wireless Healing\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 can determine if this is the case. Anyone of these four reasons or flaws will keep the Operating System from doing its job of getting you well.\n\n102914: Immune System Boosters. Feeding your body certain foods may help to keep your immune system running strong. Plan your meals to include the following 10 powerful immune system boosters and you may increase your family's chances of fending off those winter bugs before they get anyone sick.\n\n6731555: Causes of pelvic inflammatory disease. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is caused by an infection developing in the female upper genital tract. In most cases, the condition is caused by a bacterial infection spreading from the vagina or cervix (entrance to the womb) into the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries. PID is often caused by more than one type of bacterium and it can sometimes be difficult for doctors to pinpoint which are responsible.\n\n8631815: When you have a kidney transplant, the new kidney is \u00e2\u0080\u009cforeign\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your body. Your body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune system fights off or destroys (rejects) anything foreign to keep it running smooth. Because of this, you will take immunosuppressive medications for the rest of your life to prevent your body from rejecting your kidney. Rejection comes in several forms: Hyperacute rejection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Because of crossmatching prior to the transplant, this is a very rare form of rejection. It is when the body immediately destroys the transplanted kidney. Acute rejection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Usually occurrs in the first few months after transplant, but it can happen at any time after the transplant.\n\n5292495: Research the causes of these diseases that are similar to, or related to, Autoimmune Urticaria: 1  Idiopathic urticaria without angioedema. 2  Chronic urticaria. 3  Occult infection (e.g., sinusitis, oral infection, cholecystitis, vaginitis, prostatitis, hepatitis, HIV, tinea manus or pedis).4  Malignancy.5  Thyroid disease.esearch the causes of these diseases that are similar to, or related to, Autoimmune Urticaria: 1  Idiopathic urticaria without angioedema. 2  Chronic urticaria. 3  Occult infection (e.g., sinusitis, oral infection, cholecystitis, vaginitis, prostatitis, hepatitis, HIV, tinea manus or pedis). 4  Malignancy. 5  Thyroid disease.\n\n7342551: Tacrolimus lowers your body's immune system. The immune system helps your body fight infections. The immune system can also fight or reject a transplanted organ such as a liver or kidney. This is because the immune system treats the new organ as an invader.\n\n1082285: Failure to adequately wash hands is a major cause of infectious diseases. Individuals who practice poor personal hygiene while preparing food may spread diseases such as hepatitis A, salmonellosis, and shigellosis. Studies indicate that onethird (33%) of people do not wash their hands after using the restroom.\n\n6565887: EPSTEIN\u00e2\u0080\u0093BARR VIRUS & the immune defense system Epstein\u00e2\u0080\u0093Barr Virus (EBV) is a common human virus that causes reactivation usually occurs without symptoms of illness. EBV also establishes a lifelong dormant infection in some cells of the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune system.\n\n7517269: Congestive Heart Failure can be caused by: 1  Diseases that weaken the heart muscle. 2  Diseases that cause stiffening of the heart muscles.  Diseases that increase oxygen demand by the body tissue beyond the capability of the heart to deliver adequate oxygen-rich blood.\n\n6089667: Pathogens cause disease. A pathogen (disease-causing agent) is a microorganism that causes disease in its host (human, animals, plant, another microorganism).Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and a newly discovered class of pathogens prions. pathogen (disease-causing agent) is a microorganism that causes disease in its host (human, animals, plant, another microorganism).\n\n7626349: Inherited kidney diseases such as polycystic kidney disease as well as diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of kidney failure requiring transplant. If left untreated, kidney failure can be fatal. Prior to transplant, most patients require dialysis, a mechanical treatment to filter the blood to rid your body of harmful wastes, extra salt and water. While most people are born with two kidneys, we can survive with one.\n\n464837: Depending on the infection, the body can be affected minimally or severely. In a viral cold infection, the body may feel general discomfort and illness for a short period of time. The Epstein-Barr viral infection, however, can cause the body to become extremely exhausted, which can last for months in some cases. Other infections can cause fevers, pain, and weight loss. Be sure to see your doctor if you have any infection that is bothersome or persistent, or if you don't know what it is.\n\n3553796: The exact cause of inflammatory bowel disease remains unknown. Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate but don't cause IBD. One possible cause is an immune system malfunction.\n\n7404462: A. When Addison's disease is the result of a problem with the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency), the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the adrenal glands. This autoimmune assault destroys the outer layer of the glands. This happens in 70% of Addison cases.\n\n8001447: A few people will have a longer window period, so if you get a negative antibody test result in the first 3 months after possible exposure, you should get a repeat test after 3 months. Ninety-seven percent of people will develop antibodies in the first 3 months after they are infected.\n\n280750: TB (Tuberculosis) under a microscope! 1  TB can infect any part of the body. 2  TB can remain in a latent state for periods of time. 3  Coughing and sneezing are the most common cause of TB transmission.  Typically, TB targets the lungs and 1  throat. During the latency period, the TB-resistant host is not contagious.\n\n6123241: Causes of intertrigo. Intertrigo affects the upper part of folded skin and is caused by moisture, fungi, or bacteria in the skin folds. This condition is common in areas that are warm with moist climates. Intertrigo can also occur when there is no infection, for instance, when the area becomes inflamed. The areas of skin folds will rub against each other and cause irritation and wearing out of skin, which could result in inflammation.\n\n2820500: A) The immune system does not appear until the preteen years. B) The thymus is so active in children that it fights bacteria so hard that it produces strong. symptoms of disease. C) Because of their small size, children's bodies cannot contain as much lymphoid tissue as those. of adults.\n\n8199150: Why is Low Body Temperature Important? The body's enzymatic processes slow over 10%, sometimes 20% per degree of temperature below optimum. Slower chemical function, repair, and disposal of local and environmental toxins puts the body below expected function.This can cause many syndromes and symptoms, such as those listed below.he body's enzymatic processes slow over 10%, sometimes 20% per degree of temperature below optimum. Slower chemical function, repair, and disposal of local and environmental toxins puts the body below expected function. This can cause many syndromes and symptoms, such as those listed below.\n\n6757562: Atrial fibrillation is often referred to as sick sinus syndrome because the sinoatrial (sinus) node in the right atrium controls the electrical impulses. The cause of atrial fibrillation is not always known. Conditions that can cause damage to the heart and lead to atrial fibrillation include: 1  high blood pressure.  congestive heart failure.\n\n7687312: Sickle cell anemia is hereditary. It affects their hemoglobin molecules, they have a different shape that causes the Red Blood Cell to distort into a sickled shape. The proble \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 m with the hemoglobin as well as the shape issue causes oxygen problems in the body. 7 people found this useful.\n\n1724235: There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including: 1  pernicious anaemia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.here are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including: 1  pernicious anaemia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.\n\n3431185: Infections from bacterial invasion can cause loss of appetite and nausea. Loss of appetite and nausea are common symptoms that affect everyone at some point. The symptoms of lack of appetite and nausea are often non-specific can occur as a result of a variety of conditions. The most common causes of nausea and lack of appetite are conditions that affect the gastrointestinal tract, although systemic infections may also be the culprit.\n\n4768858: antibody. an immunoglobulin molecule having a specific amino acid sequence that gives each antibody the ability to adhere to and interact only with the antigen that induced its synthesis. This antigen-specific property of the antibody is the basis of the antigen-antibody reaction that is essential to an immune response.ntibody production, its interaction with a specific antigen, and the activation of complement (C), an interrelated group of eleven proteins, are the major components of the humoral system of immunity.\n\n3255503: If the red blood cells are fragmented (broken) into smaller parts, this can cause the RDW to be high and the MCV to be low. In this situation, the red blood cells vary in size\n\n1401259: There are two types of African trypanosomiasis (also called sleeping sickness); each is named for the region of Africa in which they were found historically. East African trypanosomiasis is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, which is carried by the tsetse fly.Each year, a few hundred cases of East African trypanosomiasis are reported to the World Health Organization. person will get East African trypanosomiasis if he or she is bitten by a tsetse fly infected with the Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense parasite. The proportion of tsetse flies that are infected with this parasite is low.\n\n409710: Discussion of antibodies. 1  cell-mediated immunity (CMI). 2  T cells (lymphocytes) bind to the surface of other cells that display the antigen and trigger a response. 3  The response may involve. T cells (lymphocytes) bind to the surface of other cells that display the antigen and trigger a response. 2  The response may involve. 3  other lymphocytes and. 4  any of the other white blood cells (leukocytes).\n\n8533341: Four basic types of hard drive failures: 1  Software or firmware damage may cause the disk to become unreadable, resulting in the inability to interact properly with the computer. 2  Problems with the controller board on the hard disk may result in electronic failure.\n\n6799352: For chronic prostatitis, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers believe: a microorganism can cause chronic prostatitis; your immune system is responding to a previous UTI; your immune system is reacting to nerve damage in the area; For acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, bacterial infections are the cause. Sometimes, bacteria can get into the prostate through the urethra. You are at increased risk of prostate infection if you use a catheter or have a medical procedure involving the urethra.\n\n821959: As in other autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural ability to attack invading viruses and bacteria goes haywire and mistakenly sees healthy body proteins as enemies. Redness, pain, heat and swelling signal that the immune system is on the warpath.\n\n8077207: Causes of upper GI bleeding. Peptic ulcers are a common cause of GI bleeding. These ulcers are open sores that develop in the lining of your stomach or duodenum. An infection from H. pylori bacteria usually causes peptic ulcers. Also, enlarged veins in your esophagus can tear and bleed as a result of a condition called esophageal varices. Tears in the walls of your esophagus can also cause GI bleeding. This condition is known as Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Causes of lower GI bleeding. One of the most common causes of lower GI bleeding is colitis, which occurs when your colon becomes inflamed. Colitis has multiple causes, including: infection. food poisoning; parasites; Crohn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease or ulcerative colitis; reduced blood flow in the colon\n\n205918: Some Illnesses Cause Fatigue. Feeling fatigued can be like an alarm going off in your body. It may be the first sign that something is wrong. But, fatigue itself is not a disease. For example, many older people live with rheumatoid arthritis, a painful condition that affects the joints, usually in hands or feet.\n\n462359: 10 Common Digestive Disorders. The spleen is part of the lymphatic system, which plays a role in immunity and maintenance of healthy blood cells. It is an important organ and is affected by disorders of the blood, liver, and immune system. An enlarged spleen is known as splenomegaly. Although hepatosplenomegaly often produces no symptoms, it is known to cause abdominal pain in the upper portion of your abdomen.\n\n2073388: Galactosemia I and II are treated by removing galactose from the diet. Since galactose is a breakdown product of lactose, the primary sugar constituent of milk, this means all milk and foods containing milk products must be totally eliminated.alactosemia iii. Galactosemia III is caused by defects in the gene that codes for an enzyme called uridyl diphosphogalactose-4-epimerase (GALE). This form of galactosemia is very rare. There are two forms of galactosemia III, a severe form, which is exceedingly rare, and a benign form.\n\n4985599: C. immitis can cause a disease called coccidioidomycosis or (valley fever. Its incubation period varies from 7 to 21 days. Coccidioidomycosis is not easily diagnosed on the basis of vital signs and symptoms, which are usually vague and nonspecific.occidioides immitis is a pathogenic fungus that resides in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and a few other areas in the Western Hemisphere. Contents.\n\n1435261: DESCRIPTION: When someone develops an autoimmune disorder their body produces antibodies to healthy organs and attacks them as if they were a disease. The antibodies that are produced to fight a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own cells can be measured in the blood using the ANA or antinuclear antibodies with Reflex Test.ESCRIPTION: When someone develops an autoimmune disorder their body produces antibodies to healthy organs and attacks them as if they were a disease. The antibodies that are produced to fight a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own cells can be measured in the blood using the ANA or antinuclear antibodies with Reflex Test.\n\n1417450: Genetic Changes. Mutations in the NF1 gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1. The NF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin. This protein is produced in many cells, including nerve cells and specialized cells surrounding nerves (oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells).\n\n3174268: When cells become resistant to insulin, insulin is unable to take sugar from the blood stream to the cells to use for energy, and instead the sugar remains in the blood. As a result, the liver responds by making more sugar because it thinks the body needs it for fuel and the pancreas responds by making more insulin.\n\n7666629: Blood sugar then drops or plummets, causing the adrenals to work to bring levels back up. When you are suffering from fatigued adrenal glands, cortisol levels drop and make it difficult to maintain normal blood sugar levels. People with adrenal fatigue tend to have low blood sugar.\n\n3103902: Patient Comments Read 6 Comments Share Your Story. 1  An allergic reaction is the body's way of responding to an invader.. 2  When the body senses a foreign substance, called an antigen, the immune system is triggered.\n\n1000360: How It Works. T cells, a type of immune cell, are present with receptors on their surface, called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. Typically these TCRs bind to antigens to mount an immune response. In an attempt to use T cells for cancer therapy, T cells are collected from a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own blood.\n\n1485445: List of causes of Hypotension. Following is a list of causes or underlying conditions (see also Misdiagnosis of underlying causes of Hypotension) that could possibly cause Hypotension includes: Pulmonary embolism. Heart failure.\n\n7048349: Dioxin poisoning may cause the kidneys to shut down. Organ failure may occur as a result of dioxin poisoning. Dioxins may be present in certain herbicides. Compounds like agent orange may cause cancer and heart problems, although these conditions may not be diagnosed until years after exposure.\n\n6960036: Ineffective elimination can be hormonal (in aldosterone deficiency) or due to causes in the renal parenchyma that impair excretion. Increased extracellular potassium levels result in depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells due to the increase in the equilibrium potential of potassium.\n\n6973040: A low ferritin level is the most common nutritional cause of hair loss in women. Iron is essential for good follicle health. Ferritin is the name given to the iron that is stored in the body cells. It's different from the iron we have in our blood cells, known as haemoglobin. Scroll down for more.\n\n2495951: Hemoglobin in the RBCs becomes full of oxygen when moving through the lungs. This oxygen is released and distributed as the RBCs move through the capillaries into tissues and organs. If hemoglobin is low tissues will not receive enough oxygen causing poor healing and can create an excess workload on the heart. Red blood cells are produced by the bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 120 days. An RBC count that is too high or too low can both cause health problems.\n\n6734187: The noun virulence derives from the adjective virulent. Virulent can describe either disease severity or a pathogen's infectivity. The word virulent derives from the Latin word virulentus, meaning a poisoned wound or full of poison..In an ecological context, virulence can be defined as the host's parasite-induced loss of fitness.irulent bacteria [edit]. The ability of bacteria to cause disease is described in terms of the number of infecting bacteria, the route of entry into the body, the effects of host defense mechanisms, and intrinsic characteristics of the bacteria called virulence factors.\n\n1418804: The extent of the hair loss varies; in some cases, it is only in a few spots. In others, the hair loss can be greater. On rare occasions, the person loses all of the hair on his or her head (alopecia areata totalis) or entire body (alopecia areata universalis). It is believed that the person's genetic makeup may trigger the autoimmune reaction of alopecia areata, along with a virus or a substance the person comes into contact with. Alopecia areata is an unpredictable disease. In some people ...\n\n2032793: What causes dumping syndrome? For those who have undergone gastric surgery, it can be hard to regulate the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Eating certain foods such as those with refined sugars, which quickly absorb water, may cause symptoms.\n\n3965162: 1 Cold shock proteins help the cell to survive in temperatures lower than optimum growth temperature.  Heat shock proteins help the cell to survive in temperatures greater than the optimum, possibly by condensation of the chromosome and organization of the prokaryotic nucleoid.\n\n2337291: 1 Associated autoimmune or collagen vascular diseases. 2  Exposure to medications or toxins such as asbestos, tobacco smoke, or environmental toxins. 3  Associated genetic diseases. 4  The cause is not known (idiopathic).  The most common symptoms of interstitial lung disease are a dry cough and shortness of breath.\n\n7877887: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Systemic chondromalacia or Atrophic polychondritis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a rare disorder that causes inflammation of the connective tissue, specifically the cartilage surrounding the eyes, nose, and ears.mong the main symptoms of relapsing polychondritis includes pain that occurs suddenly around the ears, nose, and eyes, as well as the joints and tissues. Inflammation is another common symptom that causes stiffness, or arthritis, in the hands and feet, wrists, knees, and ankles.\n\n3843904: Why COPD Emphysema Symptoms arise? COPD patients show the symptoms of disease due to inflamed and infected alveoli inside lungs. The pulmonary system gets damaged due to regular smoking and addition of toxins on the lung area. The condition of COPD might get chronic with time as the disease is incurable.\n\n1938982: Anemia Treatment for Iron Deficiency. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. If your blood is low in iron, it can't make hemoglobin. Typical causes of iron-deficiency anemia are a diet low in iron, your body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inability to absorb iron, or blood loss. Children and women of childbearing age are especially susceptible.\n\n898340: 1. Testing To Early. One of the most common reasons for a false negative result is testing too early. In order for a pregnancy test to show accurate results, you have to give your body time to produce the levels of hcg (pregnancy hormone) that the pregnancy test needs in order to trigger a positive result.\n\n8779475: Causes of Unstable Angina: Blood clots that block an artery partially or totally are what causes unstable angina. Blood clots may form, partially dissolve, and later form again and angina can occur each time a clot blocks blood flow in an artery.Learn more about excessive blood clotting. Symptoms of Unstable Angina-The pain or discomfort: 1  Often occurs while you may be resting, sleeping, or with little physical exertion.reatment for Unstable Angina First, your healthcare provider will need to find the blocked part or parts of the coronary arteries by performing a cardiac catheterization.\n\n6050990: Recommend on Facebook Tweet ShareCompartir. Shigellosis is an infectious disease caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella (shih-GEHL-uh). Most who are infected with Shigella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are exposed to the bacteria.\n\n2225033: 1 The symptoms of type 2 VWD are often more severe than type 1, but milder than type 3. 2  Type 3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 People with this rare type have very low levels of Von Willebrand factor in their blood, or none at all. 3  This causes problems similar to haemophilia.\n\n4699975: COEVOLUTION. First some definitions: coevolution is a change in the genetic composition of one species (or group) in response to a genetic change in another. More generally, the idea of some reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species is a strict definition of coevolution.hus presence of a parasite on a host does not constitute evidence for coevolution. These criticisms are quite distinct from the opportunity for coevolution once a parasite has established itself on a host. The main point is that any old interaction, symbiosis, mutualism, etc. is. with coevolution.\n\n4700805: In cases where diabetes has damaged the vagus nerve, it can cause gastroparesis, a condition wherein the muscles of the stomach and intestine are not able to efficiently move food through the gastrointestinal system.\n\n485185: Signs You May Have an Iron Deficiency. In women, the number-one cause of iron deficiency is too-heavy periods, says Jacques Moritz, MD, director of gynecology at Mount Sinai St. Luke's Roosevelt in New York City. They lose too much blood, replace about half of it, and then lose too much again the following month, he says.\n\n8168012: Notes. \u00e2\u0086\u0091 1  Paulhus, D.L., Fridhandler B., & Hayes S.

Other childhood viral infections such as chickenpox, measles, rubella, herpes, and mono can cause pneumonia directly. Viral pneumonias are fairly common. They peak during the toddler years, and become a bit less common each year. Bacterial pneumonias are less common. Most occur in children with cystic fibrosis or an underlying immune problem. All children who get two or more pneumonias within one year should have their immune system and lung anatomy evaluated by their doctor, to ensure they have no underlying illness putting them at greater risk for pneumonias. What are the symptoms?\n\n3135246: More than 25 mutations in the RET gene are known to cause a form of multiple endocrine neoplasia called type 2. Multiple endocrine neoplasia typically involves the development of tumors in two or more of the body's hormone-producing glands, called endocrine glands. These tumors can be noncancerous or cancerous.\n\n4737599: A parasitic disease is an infectious disease caused or transmitted by a parasite. Many parasites do not cause diseases. Parasitic diseases can affect practically all living organisms, including plants and mammals. The study of parasitic diseases is called parasitology.The share of parasitic diseases account for about 14 000 000 deaths per year, representing 25% of global mortality-one in four deaths according to the WHO.arasitic diseases can affect practically all living organisms, including plants and mammals.

The preschool specialist at the Department of Education states that all preschool special education students must have a physical and age appropriate immunizations in order to attend school.\n\n3808689: The 6 Big Reasons Why Estrogen Dominance (Low Progesterone) Can Greatly Inhibit Your Ability to Lose Weight & Keep it Off: 1  Excessive Estrogen Turns More Calories Into Fat. 2  Progesterone Helps Your Thyroid Hormones Function More Efficiently. 3  Progesterone Lowers Insulin Levels. 4  Progesterone is a Natural Anti-Inflammatory.\n\n5288980: A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a birth defect of the heart in which there is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the two lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart.This wall also is called the ventricular septum.lick here to view a larger image. A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a birth defect of the heart in which there is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the two lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. This wall also is called the ventricular septum.\n\n4518293: Mastocytosis (say mass-toe-sigh-toe-sis) is the abnormal growth of mast cells in the body. Mast cells are part of the immune system, which helps protect your body against infection. The most common form of mastocytosis is when mast cells accumulate on the skin, causing reddish-brown spots or bumps.In rare cases, mastocytosis can affect other parts of the body, such as the stomach, the intestines and the bone marrow. Mastocytosis can occur in people of any age.he most common form of mastocytosis is when mast cells accumulate on the skin, causing reddish-brown spots or bumps. In rare cases, mastocytosis can affect other parts of the body, such as the stomach, the intestines and the bone marrow. Mastocytosis can occur in people of any age.\n\n1876803: In most cases of Bell's palsy, the nerve that controls muscles on one side of the face is damaged by inflammation. Many health problems can cause weakness or paralysis of the face. If a specific reason cannot be found for the weakness, the condition is called Bell's palsy.\n\n2281512: 1 Hepatitis A (hep A) - The hep A virus can cause liver failure. 2  Children should get 2 doses of the vaccine starting at age 1. 3  Varicella (chickenpox) - Kids need two doses, spaced out about 4-5 years. 4  Influenza (flu) - The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months of age and older get this vaccine every year.\n\n2461267: DPT vaccine. The DPT vaccine is one type of preventive medicine called immunization (to make things resistant to disease). The vaccine causes the body to form protective antibodies (disease-fighting proteins) against three serious diseases: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus (lockjaw).\n\n3220374: The list below shows some of the causes of Kayser-Fleischer ring mentioned in various sources: 1  Ceruloplasmin deficiency. 2  Cholestasis. 3  Chronic copper poisoning. 4  Cryptogenic cirrhosis. 5  Primary biliary cirrhosis - Kayser-Fleischer rings. 6  more causes...\u00c2\u00bb.\n\n7004795: Dr. Martin Raff Dr. Raff. 1  Proteus Syndrome: Proteus syndrome, also known as wiedemann syndrome (named after the german paediatrician hans-rudolf wiedemann), is a congenital disorder that causes skin overgrowth and atypical bone development, often accompanied by tumors over half the body.\n\n1040062: AdreneVive 60 capsules. Stress can cause overstimulation to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This axis is incredibly important for every aspect of your health, as it helps to control many systems within the body, including the hormonal and neural systems. When the HPA is out of balance, this causes secondary damage due to the lowering of the immune system.\n\n6904333: Zinc is a trace mineral - needed in only small amounts by our bodies but with many important functions. Zinc deficiency can cause loss of appetite, poor growth, loss of hair, a poorly functioning immune system (leading to constant illness), poor wound healing and changes in taste sensation. RDI*.\n\n8460230: 01, 2017. Age is the most common cause of macular pucker. As you get older, the vitreous begins to shrink and pull away from the retina. Usually the vitreous pulls away with no problems. But sometimes the vitreous can stick to the retina. Scar tissue forms, causing the retina and macula to wrinkle or bulge.\n\n8177632: White blood cells are infection-fighting cells produced in the bone marrow. When a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil is lowered in the body -- a condition called neutropenia -- the immune system is weakened and a person becomes vulnerable to infections.\n\n1819985: Potential categories of causes (see Table: Some Common Causes of Fever in Children) include localized or generalized infection, connective tissue disease, and cancer. Miscellaneous specific causes include inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes insipidus with dehydration, and disordered thermoregulation.\n\n3739826: Sarcoidosis. An inflammatory disease marked by the formation of granulomas (small nodules of immune cells) in the lungs, lymph nodes, and other organs. Sarcoidosis may be acute and go away by itself, or it may be chronic and progressive. Also called sarcoid.\n\n3364605: Pneumonia is diagnosed through signs and symptoms and, sometimes, a chest X-ray. In HIV-positive people with a strong immune system, signs and symptoms are similar to those seen in HIV-negative people: fever, trouble breathing, cough that produces green or yellow sputum, and possibly chest pain.nfections appear with severe suppression of the immune system; about 90% of cases occur in people with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm 3. PCP is seared into the collective memory of the HIV community in the resource-rich world because it was such a common and fatal condition early in the epidemic.\n\n6820053: Immunoglobulin (also called gamma globulin or immune globulin) is a substance made from human blood plasma. The plasma, processed from donated human blood, contains antibodies that protect the body against diseases. When you are given an immunoglobulin, your body uses antibodies from other people's blood plasma to help prevent illness.\n\n4694035: About half of those who have mononucleosis have enlargement of the spleen, usually 2 to 3 weeks after they are infected. The incubation period\u00e2\u0080\u0094the time it takes symptoms to appear after a person becomes infected with the virus\u00e2\u0080\u0094can be 4 to 6 weeks.Symptoms of mononucleosis usually last for 1 to 4 weeks, but it might take as long as 2 months before you feel well enough to resume all of your normal activities.he most common symptoms of mononucleosis are fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands in the neck, under the arms, and in the groin area. Other symptoms include the following: 1  fatigue. 2  muscle aches or weakness.\n\n1554406: Eukaryotic pathogens. Parasitism is a dominant mode of life on the planet, and parasitic metazoan and protozoan eukaryotes cause some of the most damaging and intractable diseases of both man and his domestic animals.\n\n5885302: Although CD4 does not stabilize TCR\u00e2\u0080\u0093pMHC interactions (9, 13, 14), like CD8, it does enhance T-cell responses (1, 9). This result raises the question of whether CD4 can enhance Lck recruitment to the TCR complex and, more generally, whether CD4 and CD8 enhance T-cell sensitivity to antigen in different ways.\n\n3277725: Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a chronic skin disease that causes loss of pigment, resulting in irregular pale or white patches of skin. Common areas of the skin losing pigment are the face, lips, hands, arms, legs, and genital areas. Vitiligo occurs when the melanocytes die or are unable to function.he loss of melanocytes results in smooth, white patches in the middle of normally pigmented skin. Vitiligo, or leucoderma, is a common skin disorder, which is usually inherited, and can affect anyone anywhere. There are two main types of vitiligo patterns: segmental and non-segmental (generalized).\n\n3099421: About 95% of cases of acromegaly are caused by a benign pituitary tumor. The other 5% of cases are caused by non-pituitary tumors; those tumors, usually located in other parts of the brain, the pancreas, or the lungs, can cause the body to secrete too much growth hormone 1.\n\n7429113: Strep throat is caused by infection with Group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria, specifically Streptococcus pyogenes. The streptococcal infection invades the pharyngeal tissue and causes a localized inflammatory reaction of the throat and tonsils. These bacterial organisms are often found in the throat or on the skin, and are responsible for other illnesses as well, such as impetigo (a skin infection).\n\n2413579: Down syndrome (DS or DNS) or Down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability.own syndrome (DS or DNS) or Down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.\n\n5535520: Plant viruses cause various types of plant diseases, but the diseases do not typically result in plant death. They do however, produce symptoms such as ringspots, mosaic pattern development, leaf yellowing and distortion, as well as deformed growth.he name of the plant disease is often related to the symptoms the disease produces in the particular plant. For example, papaya leaf curl and potato leaf roll are diseases that cause specific types of leaf distortion.\n\n1782673: Prevention of TBI is the best approach since there is no cure. Mechanisms of Injury. These mechanisms are the highest causes of brain injury: Open head Injury, Closed Head Injury, Deceleration Injuries, Chemical/Toxic, Hypoxia, Tumors, Infections and Stroke. 1. Open Head Injury.\n\n7013495: Another common cause is the treatments for cancer. Radiation and chemotherapy often cause a decrease in appetite. They can also lead to side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and mouth sores, which can affect your ability to eat normally, further contributing to weight and muscle loss.\n\n1895808: Central sensitization is a condition of the nervous system that is associated with the development and maintenance of chronic pain. When central sensitization occurs, the nervous system goes through a process called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwind-up\u00e2\u0080\u009d and gets regulated in a persistent state of high reactivity.This persistent, or regulated, state of reactivity subsequently comes to maintain pain even after the initial injury might have healed.he onset of pain is often associated with subsequent development of conditions such as depression, fear-avoidance, anxiety and other stressors. The stress of these responses can, in turn, further exacerbate the reactivity of the nervous system, leading to central sensitization.\n\n8431674: Niacin, or vitamin B3, is important to proper health, but like many food components, people can develop an allergy to it. The signs and symptoms of a niacin allergy encompass a wide variety of physical problems. These can range from a simple rash to hives, trouble with blood sugar levels, and an upset stomach or ulcers. In the event a severe allergy, some individuals bleed, pass out, and even suffer from blood clots.\n\n4349039: Overstretching of the adductor tendons is a much less common cause. Failure to stretch the adductor muscles properly puts them at increased risk for injury. Weakness of the adductor muscles is a common problem that puts these muscles at increased risk for injury, as the load to failure is much less in weaker muscles.\n\n3209989: The same thing happens when you put salt water on your skin. As the water evaporates, leaving the salt behind, it attaches to the surface of infectious cells, draws the moisture out, and kills the cells. Salts help to draw out toxins, microscopic dirt, and pollutants that get into our skin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pores over time.\n\n120954: Endotoxin vs Exotoxin. Toxigenesis is the process of producing toxins by pathogenic bacteria. It is one of main mechanisms of developing diseases by bacteria. Two kinds of toxins; i.e. endotoxins and exotoxins are produced, and those can be distinguished by their chemical nature.\n\n8012858: A subsidence of the symptoms of a disease. A relapse of symptoms. Reversion to an earlier or less mature pattern of feeling or behavior. Relapse to a less perfect or developed state. The return of a population to an earlier or less complex physical type in successive generations. The relationship between the mean value of a random variable and the corresponding values of one or more independent variables. A relative fall in sea level resulting in deposition of terrestrial strata over marine strata.\n\n4192447: If the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin, or if the body cannot use the insulin properly, blood sugar levels rise and the body cannot use foods effectively. High blood sugar levels are harmful to many body tissues. Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal problem of people with diabetes.\n\n"

Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: what causes the immune system to fail\n\nDocuments:\n\n704341: An autoimmune disease is different in that the immune system is attacking \u00e2\u0080\u009cself\u00e2\u0080\u009d - parts of you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an immune system gone awry. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no organ or bodily system excluded from potential attack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour finest weapon can become your greatest enemy. For example in multiple sclerosis the immune system is attacking the myelin sheath. 2  In rheumatoid arthritis the immune system is attacking the synovial membrane between the joints. 3  The immune system can attack any organ or any system. 4  Autoimmune diseases are the fourth leading cause of disability among women.\n\n7471105: The fourth and least common, a lack of nutrients can be both a reason by itself and a cause for the other three. Sometimes the immune system just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough building blocks to work with or electrolytes (minerals) to conduct a frequency correction. Wireless Healing\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 can determine if this is the case. Anyone of these four reasons or flaws will keep the Operating System from doing its job of getting you well.\n\n102914: Immune System Boosters. Feeding your body certain foods may help to keep your immune system running strong. Plan your meals to include the following 10 powerful immune system boosters and you may increase your family's chances of fending off those winter bugs before they get anyone sick.\n\n6731555: Causes of pelvic inflammatory disease. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is caused by an infection developing in the female upper genital tract. In most cases, the condition is caused by a bacterial infection spreading from the vagina or cervix (entrance to the womb) into the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries. PID is often caused by more than one type of bacterium and it can sometimes be difficult for doctors to pinpoint which are responsible.\n\n8631815: When you have a kidney transplant, the new kidney is \u00e2\u0080\u009cforeign\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your body. Your body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune system fights off or destroys (rejects) anything foreign to keep it running smooth. Because of this, you will take immunosuppressive medications for the rest of your life to prevent your body from rejecting your kidney. Rejection comes in several forms: Hyperacute rejection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Because of crossmatching prior to the transplant, this is a very rare form of rejection. It is when the body immediately destroys the transplanted kidney. Acute rejection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Usually occurrs in the first few months after transplant, but it can happen at any time after the transplant.\n\n5292495: Research the causes of these diseases that are similar to, or related to, Autoimmune Urticaria: 1  Idiopathic urticaria without angioedema. 2  Chronic urticaria. 3  Occult infection (e.g., sinusitis, oral infection, cholecystitis, vaginitis, prostatitis, hepatitis, HIV, tinea manus or pedis).4  Malignancy.5  Thyroid disease.esearch the causes of these diseases that are similar to, or related to, Autoimmune Urticaria: 1  Idiopathic urticaria without angioedema. 2  Chronic urticaria. 3  Occult infection (e.g., sinusitis, oral infection, cholecystitis, vaginitis, prostatitis, hepatitis, HIV, tinea manus or pedis). 4  Malignancy. 5  Thyroid disease.\n\n7342551: Tacrolimus lowers your body's immune system. The immune system helps your body fight infections. The immune system can also fight or reject a transplanted organ such as a liver or kidney. This is because the immune system treats the new organ as an invader.\n\n1082285: Failure to adequately wash hands is a major cause of infectious diseases. Individuals who practice poor personal hygiene while preparing food may spread diseases such as hepatitis A, salmonellosis, and shigellosis. Studies indicate that onethird (33%) of people do not wash their hands after using the restroom.\n\n6565887: EPSTEIN\u00e2\u0080\u0093BARR VIRUS & the immune defense system Epstein\u00e2\u0080\u0093Barr Virus (EBV) is a common human virus that causes reactivation usually occurs without symptoms of illness.

Diseases that increase oxygen demand by the body tissue beyond the capability of the heart to deliver adequate oxygen-rich blood.\n\n6089667: Pathogens cause disease. A pathogen (disease-causing agent) is a microorganism that causes disease in its host (human, animals, plant, another microorganism).Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and a newly discovered class of pathogens prions. pathogen (disease-causing agent) is a microorganism that causes disease in its host (human, animals, plant, another microorganism).\n\n7626349: Inherited kidney diseases such as polycystic kidney disease as well as diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of kidney failure requiring transplant. If left untreated, kidney failure can be fatal. Prior to transplant, most patients require dialysis, a mechanical treatment to filter the blood to rid your body of harmful wastes, extra salt and water. While most people are born with two kidneys, we can survive with one.\n\n464837: Depending on the infection, the body can be affected minimally or severely. In a viral cold infection, the body may feel general discomfort and illness for a short period of time. The Epstein-Barr viral infection, however, can cause the body to become extremely exhausted, which can last for months in some cases. Other infections can cause fevers, pain, and weight loss. Be sure to see your doctor if you have any infection that is bothersome or persistent, or if you don't know what it is.\n\n3553796: The exact cause of inflammatory bowel disease remains unknown. Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate but don't cause IBD. One possible cause is an immune system malfunction.\n\n7404462: A. When Addison's disease is the result of a problem with the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency), the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the adrenal glands. This autoimmune assault destroys the outer layer of the glands. This happens in 70% of Addison cases.\n\n8001447: A few people will have a longer window period, so if you get a negative antibody test result in the first 3 months after possible exposure, you should get a repeat test after 3 months. Ninety-seven percent of people will develop antibodies in the first 3 months after they are infected.\n\n280750: TB (Tuberculosis) under a microscope! 1  TB can infect any part of the body. 2  TB can remain in a latent state for periods of time. 3  Coughing and sneezing are the most common cause of TB transmission.  Typically, TB targets the lungs and 1  throat. During the latency period, the TB-resistant host is not contagious.\n\n6123241: Causes of intertrigo. Intertrigo affects the upper part of folded skin and is caused by moisture, fungi, or bacteria in the skin folds. This condition is common in areas that are warm with moist climates. Intertrigo can also occur when there is no infection, for instance, when the area becomes inflamed. The areas of skin folds will rub against each other and cause irritation and wearing out of skin, which could result in inflammation.\n\n2820500: A) The immune system does not appear until the preteen years. B) The thymus is so active in children that it fights bacteria so hard that it produces strong. symptoms of disease. C) Because of their small size, children's bodies cannot contain as much lymphoid tissue as those. of adults.\n\n8199150: Why is Low Body Temperature Important? The body's enzymatic processes slow over 10%, sometimes 20% per degree of temperature below optimum. Slower chemical function, repair, and disposal of local and environmental toxins puts the body below expected function.This can cause many syndromes and symptoms, such as those listed below.he body's enzymatic processes slow over 10%, sometimes 20% per degree of temperature below optimum. Slower chemical function, repair, and disposal of local and environmental toxins puts the body below expected function. This can cause many syndromes and symptoms, such as those listed below.\n\n6757562: Atrial fibrillation is often referred to as sick sinus syndrome because the sinoatrial (sinus) node in the right atrium controls the electrical impulses. The cause of atrial fibrillation is not always known. Conditions that can cause damage to the heart and lead to atrial fibrillation include: 1  high blood pressure.  congestive heart failure.\n\n7687312: Sickle cell anemia is hereditary. It affects their hemoglobin molecules, they have a different shape that causes the Red Blood Cell to distort into a sickled shape. The proble \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 m with the hemoglobin as well as the shape issue causes oxygen problems in the body. 7 people found this useful.\n\n1724235: There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including: 1  pernicious anaemia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.here are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including: 1  pernicious anaemia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.\n\n3431185: Infections from bacterial invasion can cause loss of appetite and nausea. Loss of appetite and nausea are common symptoms that affect everyone at some point. The symptoms of lack of appetite and nausea are often non-specific can occur as a result of a variety of conditions. The most common causes of nausea and lack of appetite are conditions that affect the gastrointestinal tract, although systemic infections may also be the culprit.\n\n4768858: antibody. an immunoglobulin molecule having a specific amino acid sequence that gives each antibody the ability to adhere to and interact only with the antigen that induced its synthesis. This antigen-specific property of the antibody is the basis of the antigen-antibody reaction that is essential to an immune response.ntibody production, its interaction with a specific antigen, and the activation of complement (C), an interrelated group of eleven proteins, are the major components of the humoral system of immunity.\n\n3255503: If the red blood cells are fragmented (broken) into smaller parts, this can cause the RDW to be high and the MCV to be low. In this situation, the red blood cells vary in size\n\n1401259: There are two types of African trypanosomiasis (also called sleeping sickness); each is named for the region of Africa in which they were found historically. East African trypanosomiasis is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, which is carried by the tsetse fly.Each year, a few hundred cases of East African trypanosomiasis are reported to the World Health Organization. person will get East African trypanosomiasis if he or she is bitten by a tsetse fly infected with the Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense parasite. The proportion of tsetse flies that are infected with this parasite is low.\n\n409710: Discussion of antibodies. 1  cell-mediated immunity (CMI). 2  T cells (lymphocytes) bind to the surface of other cells that display the antigen and trigger a response. 3  The response may involve.

Researchers believe: a microorganism can cause chronic prostatitis; your immune system is responding to a previous UTI; your immune system is reacting to nerve damage in the area; For acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, bacterial infections are the cause. Sometimes, bacteria can get into the prostate through the urethra. You are at increased risk of prostate infection if you use a catheter or have a medical procedure involving the urethra.\n\n821959: As in other autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural ability to attack invading viruses and bacteria goes haywire and mistakenly sees healthy body proteins as enemies. Redness, pain, heat and swelling signal that the immune system is on the warpath.\n\n8077207: Causes of upper GI bleeding. Peptic ulcers are a common cause of GI bleeding. These ulcers are open sores that develop in the lining of your stomach or duodenum. An infection from H. pylori bacteria usually causes peptic ulcers. Also, enlarged veins in your esophagus can tear and bleed as a result of a condition called esophageal varices. Tears in the walls of your esophagus can also cause GI bleeding. This condition is known as Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Causes of lower GI bleeding. One of the most common causes of lower GI bleeding is colitis, which occurs when your colon becomes inflamed. Colitis has multiple causes, including: infection. food poisoning; parasites; Crohn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease or ulcerative colitis; reduced blood flow in the colon\n\n205918: Some Illnesses Cause Fatigue. Feeling fatigued can be like an alarm going off in your body. It may be the first sign that something is wrong. But, fatigue itself is not a disease. For example, many older people live with rheumatoid arthritis, a painful condition that affects the joints, usually in hands or feet.\n\n462359: 10 Common Digestive Disorders. The spleen is part of the lymphatic system, which plays a role in immunity and maintenance of healthy blood cells. It is an important organ and is affected by disorders of the blood, liver, and immune system. An enlarged spleen is known as splenomegaly. Although hepatosplenomegaly often produces no symptoms, it is known to cause abdominal pain in the upper portion of your abdomen.\n\n2073388: Galactosemia I and II are treated by removing galactose from the diet. Since galactose is a breakdown product of lactose, the primary sugar constituent of milk, this means all milk and foods containing milk products must be totally eliminated.alactosemia iii. Galactosemia III is caused by defects in the gene that codes for an enzyme called uridyl diphosphogalactose-4-epimerase (GALE). This form of galactosemia is very rare. There are two forms of galactosemia III, a severe form, which is exceedingly rare, and a benign form.\n\n4985599: C. immitis can cause a disease called coccidioidomycosis or (valley fever. Its incubation period varies from 7 to 21 days. Coccidioidomycosis is not easily diagnosed on the basis of vital signs and symptoms, which are usually vague and nonspecific.occidioides immitis is a pathogenic fungus that resides in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and a few other areas in the Western Hemisphere. Contents.\n\n1435261: DESCRIPTION: When someone develops an autoimmune disorder their body produces antibodies to healthy organs and attacks them as if they were a disease. The antibodies that are produced to fight a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own cells can be measured in the blood using the ANA or antinuclear antibodies with Reflex Test.ESCRIPTION: When someone develops an autoimmune disorder their body produces antibodies to healthy organs and attacks them as if they were a disease. The antibodies that are produced to fight a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own cells can be measured in the blood using the ANA or antinuclear antibodies with Reflex Test.\n\n1417450: Genetic Changes. Mutations in the NF1 gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1. The NF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin. This protein is produced in many cells, including nerve cells and specialized cells surrounding nerves (oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells).\n\n3174268: When cells become resistant to insulin, insulin is unable to take sugar from the blood stream to the cells to use for energy, and instead the sugar remains in the blood. As a result, the liver responds by making more sugar because it thinks the body needs it for fuel and the pancreas responds by making more insulin.\n\n7666629: Blood sugar then drops or plummets, causing the adrenals to work to bring levels back up. When you are suffering from fatigued adrenal glands, cortisol levels drop and make it difficult to maintain normal blood sugar levels. People with adrenal fatigue tend to have low blood sugar.\n\n3103902: Patient Comments Read 6 Comments Share Your Story. 1  An allergic reaction is the body's way of responding to an invader.. 2  When the body senses a foreign substance, called an antigen, the immune system is triggered.\n\n1000360: How It Works. T cells, a type of immune cell, are present with receptors on their surface, called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. Typically these TCRs bind to antigens to mount an immune response. In an attempt to use T cells for cancer therapy, T cells are collected from a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own blood.\n\n1485445: List of causes of Hypotension. Following is a list of causes or underlying conditions (see also Misdiagnosis of underlying causes of Hypotension) that could possibly cause Hypotension includes: Pulmonary embolism. Heart failure.\n\n7048349: Dioxin poisoning may cause the kidneys to shut down. Organ failure may occur as a result of dioxin poisoning. Dioxins may be present in certain herbicides. Compounds like agent orange may cause cancer and heart problems, although these conditions may not be diagnosed until years after exposure.\n\n6960036: Ineffective elimination can be hormonal (in aldosterone deficiency) or due to causes in the renal parenchyma that impair excretion. Increased extracellular potassium levels result in depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells due to the increase in the equilibrium potential of potassium.\n\n6973040: A low ferritin level is the most common nutritional cause of hair loss in women. Iron is essential for good follicle health. Ferritin is the name given to the iron that is stored in the body cells. It's different from the iron we have in our blood cells, known as haemoglobin. Scroll down for more.\n\n2495951: Hemoglobin in the RBCs becomes full of oxygen when moving through the lungs. This oxygen is released and distributed as the RBCs move through the capillaries into tissues and organs. If hemoglobin is low tissues will not receive enough oxygen causing poor healing and can create an excess workload on the heart. Red blood cells are produced by the bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 120 days. An RBC count that is too high or too low can both cause health problems.\n\n6734187: The noun virulence derives from the adjective virulent. Virulent can describe either disease severity or a pathogen's infectivity. The word virulent derives from the Latin word virulentus, meaning a poisoned wound or full of poison..In an ecological context, virulence can be defined as the host's parasite-induced loss of fitness.irulent bacteria [edit]. The ability of bacteria to cause disease is described in terms of the number of infecting bacteria, the route of entry into the body, the effects of host defense mechanisms, and intrinsic characteristics of the bacteria called virulence factors.\n\n1418804: The extent of the hair loss varies; in some cases, it is only in a few spots. In others, the hair loss can be greater. On rare occasions, the person loses all of the hair on his or her head (alopecia areata totalis) or entire body (alopecia areata universalis). It is believed that the person's genetic makeup may trigger the autoimmune reaction of alopecia areata, along with a virus or a substance the person comes into contact with. Alopecia areata is an unpredictable disease. In some people ...\n\n2032793: What causes dumping syndrome? For those who have undergone gastric surgery, it can be hard to regulate the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Eating certain foods such as those with refined sugars, which quickly absorb water, may cause symptoms.\n\n3965162: 1 Cold shock proteins help the cell to survive in temperatures lower than optimum growth temperature.  Heat shock proteins help the cell to survive in temperatures greater than the optimum, possibly by condensation of the chromosome and organization of the prokaryotic nucleoid.\n\n2337291: 1 Associated autoimmune or collagen vascular diseases. 2  Exposure to medications or toxins such as asbestos, tobacco smoke, or environmental toxins. 3  Associated genetic diseases. 4  The cause is not known (idiopathic).

Inflammation is another common symptom that causes stiffness, or arthritis, in the hands and feet, wrists, knees, and ankles.\n\n3843904: Why COPD Emphysema Symptoms arise? COPD patients show the symptoms of disease due to inflamed and infected alveoli inside lungs. The pulmonary system gets damaged due to regular smoking and addition of toxins on the lung area. The condition of COPD might get chronic with time as the disease is incurable.\n\n1938982: Anemia Treatment for Iron Deficiency. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. If your blood is low in iron, it can't make hemoglobin. Typical causes of iron-deficiency anemia are a diet low in iron, your body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inability to absorb iron, or blood loss. Children and women of childbearing age are especially susceptible.\n\n898340: 1. Testing To Early. One of the most common reasons for a false negative result is testing too early. In order for a pregnancy test to show accurate results, you have to give your body time to produce the levels of hcg (pregnancy hormone) that the pregnancy test needs in order to trigger a positive result.\n\n8779475: Causes of Unstable Angina: Blood clots that block an artery partially or totally are what causes unstable angina. Blood clots may form, partially dissolve, and later form again and angina can occur each time a clot blocks blood flow in an artery.Learn more about excessive blood clotting. Symptoms of Unstable Angina-The pain or discomfort: 1  Often occurs while you may be resting, sleeping, or with little physical exertion.reatment for Unstable Angina First, your healthcare provider will need to find the blocked part or parts of the coronary arteries by performing a cardiac catheterization.\n\n6050990: Recommend on Facebook Tweet ShareCompartir. Shigellosis is an infectious disease caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella (shih-GEHL-uh). Most who are infected with Shigella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are exposed to the bacteria.\n\n2225033: 1 The symptoms of type 2 VWD are often more severe than type 1, but milder than type 3. 2  Type 3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 People with this rare type have very low levels of Von Willebrand factor in their blood, or none at all. 3  This causes problems similar to haemophilia.\n\n4699975: COEVOLUTION. First some definitions: coevolution is a change in the genetic composition of one species (or group) in response to a genetic change in another. More generally, the idea of some reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species is a strict definition of coevolution.hus presence of a parasite on a host does not constitute evidence for coevolution. These criticisms are quite distinct from the opportunity for coevolution once a parasite has established itself on a host. The main point is that any old interaction, symbiosis, mutualism, etc. is. with coevolution.\n\n4700805: In cases where diabetes has damaged the vagus nerve, it can cause gastroparesis, a condition wherein the muscles of the stomach and intestine are not able to efficiently move food through the gastrointestinal system.\n\n485185: Signs You May Have an Iron Deficiency. In women, the number-one cause of iron deficiency is too-heavy periods, says Jacques Moritz, MD, director of gynecology at Mount Sinai St. Luke's Roosevelt in New York City. They lose too much blood, replace about half of it, and then lose too much again the following month, he says.\n\n8168012: Notes. \u00e2\u0086\u0091 1  Paulhus, D.L., Fridhandler B., & Hayes S.

Other childhood viral infections such as chickenpox, measles, rubella, herpes, and mono can cause pneumonia directly. Viral pneumonias are fairly common. They peak during the toddler years, and become a bit less common each year. Bacterial pneumonias are less common. Most occur in children with cystic fibrosis or an underlying immune problem. All children who get two or more pneumonias within one year should have their immune system and lung anatomy evaluated by their doctor, to ensure they have no underlying illness putting them at greater risk for pneumonias. What are the symptoms?\n\n3135246: More than 25 mutations in the RET gene are known to cause a form of multiple endocrine neoplasia called type 2. Multiple endocrine neoplasia typically involves the development of tumors in two or more of the body's hormone-producing glands, called endocrine glands. These tumors can be noncancerous or cancerous.\n\n4737599: A parasitic disease is an infectious disease caused or transmitted by a parasite. Many parasites do not cause diseases. Parasitic diseases can affect practically all living organisms, including plants and mammals.

Mastocytosis can occur in people of any age.\n\n1876803: In most cases of Bell's palsy, the nerve that controls muscles on one side of the face is damaged by inflammation. Many health problems can cause weakness or paralysis of the face. If a specific reason cannot be found for the weakness, the condition is called Bell's palsy.\n\n2281512: 1 Hepatitis A (hep A) - The hep A virus can cause liver failure. 2  Children should get 2 doses of the vaccine starting at age 1. 3  Varicella (chickenpox) - Kids need two doses, spaced out about 4-5 years. 4  Influenza (flu) - The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months of age and older get this vaccine every year.\n\n2461267: DPT vaccine. The DPT vaccine is one type of preventive medicine called immunization (to make things resistant to disease). The vaccine causes the body to form protective antibodies (disease-fighting proteins) against three serious diseases: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus (lockjaw).\n\n3220374: The list below shows some of the causes of Kayser-Fleischer ring mentioned in various sources: 1  Ceruloplasmin deficiency. 2  Cholestasis. 3  Chronic copper poisoning. 4  Cryptogenic cirrhosis. 5  Primary biliary cirrhosis - Kayser-Fleischer rings. 6  more causes...\u00c2\u00bb.\n\n7004795: Dr. Martin Raff Dr. Raff. 1  Proteus Syndrome: Proteus syndrome, also known as wiedemann syndrome (named after the german paediatrician hans-rudolf wiedemann), is a congenital disorder that causes skin overgrowth and atypical bone development, often accompanied by tumors over half the body.\n\n1040062: AdreneVive 60 capsules. Stress can cause overstimulation to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This axis is incredibly important for every aspect of your health, as it helps to control many systems within the body, including the hormonal and neural systems. When the HPA is out of balance, this causes secondary damage due to the lowering of the immune system.\n\n6904333: Zinc is a trace mineral - needed in only small amounts by our bodies but with many important functions. Zinc deficiency can cause loss of appetite, poor growth, loss of hair, a poorly functioning immune system (leading to constant illness), poor wound healing and changes in taste sensation. RDI*.\n\n8460230: 01, 2017. Age is the most common cause of macular pucker. As you get older, the vitreous begins to shrink and pull away from the retina. Usually the vitreous pulls away with no problems. But sometimes the vitreous can stick to the retina. Scar tissue forms, causing the retina and macula to wrinkle or bulge.\n\n8177632: White blood cells are infection-fighting cells produced in the bone marrow. When a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil is lowered in the body -- a condition called neutropenia -- the immune system is weakened and a person becomes vulnerable to infections.\n\n1819985: Potential categories of causes (see Table: Some Common Causes of Fever in Children) include localized or generalized infection, connective tissue disease, and cancer. Miscellaneous specific causes include inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes insipidus with dehydration, and disordered thermoregulation.\n\n3739826: Sarcoidosis.

Sarcoidosis may be acute and go away by itself, or it may be chronic and progressive. Also called sarcoid.\n\n3364605: Pneumonia is diagnosed through signs and symptoms and, sometimes, a chest X-ray. In HIV-positive people with a strong immune system, signs and symptoms are similar to those seen in HIV-negative people: fever, trouble breathing, cough that produces green or yellow sputum, and possibly chest pain.nfections appear with severe suppression of the immune system; about 90% of cases occur in people with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm 3. PCP is seared into the collective memory of the HIV community in the resource-rich world because it was such a common and fatal condition early in the epidemic.\n\n6820053: Immunoglobulin (also called gamma globulin or immune globulin) is a substance made from human blood plasma. The plasma, processed from donated human blood, contains antibodies that protect the body against diseases. When you are given an immunoglobulin, your body uses antibodies from other people's blood plasma to help prevent illness.\n\n4694035: About half of those who have mononucleosis have enlargement of the spleen, usually 2 to 3 weeks after they are infected. The incubation period\u00e2\u0080\u0094the time it takes symptoms to appear after a person becomes infected with the virus\u00e2\u0080\u0094can be 4 to 6 weeks.Symptoms of mononucleosis usually last for 1 to 4 weeks, but it might take as long as 2 months before you feel well enough to resume all of your normal activities.he most common symptoms of mononucleosis are fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands in the neck, under the arms, and in the groin area. Other symptoms include the following: 1  fatigue. 2  muscle aches or weakness.\n\n1554406: Eukaryotic pathogens. Parasitism is a dominant mode of life on the planet, and parasitic metazoan and protozoan eukaryotes cause some of the most damaging and intractable diseases of both man and his domestic animals.\n\n5885302: Although CD4 does not stabilize TCR\u00e2\u0080\u0093pMHC interactions (9, 13, 14), like CD8, it does enhance T-cell responses (1, 9). This result raises the question of whether CD4 can enhance Lck recruitment to the TCR complex and, more generally, whether CD4 and CD8 enhance T-cell sensitivity to antigen in different ways.\n\n3277725: Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a chronic skin disease that causes loss of pigment, resulting in irregular pale or white patches of skin. Common areas of the skin losing pigment are the face, lips, hands, arms, legs, and genital areas. Vitiligo occurs when the melanocytes die or are unable to function.he loss of melanocytes results in smooth, white patches in the middle of normally pigmented skin. Vitiligo, or leucoderma, is a common skin disorder, which is usually inherited, and can affect anyone anywhere. There are two main types of vitiligo patterns: segmental and non-segmental (generalized).\n\n3099421: About 95% of cases of acromegaly are caused by a benign pituitary tumor. The other 5% of cases are caused by non-pituitary tumors; those tumors, usually located in other parts of the brain, the pancreas, or the lungs, can cause the body to secrete too much growth hormone 1.\n\n7429113: Strep throat is caused by infection with Group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria, specifically Streptococcus pyogenes. The streptococcal infection invades the pharyngeal tissue and causes a localized inflammatory reaction of the throat and tonsils. These bacterial organisms are often found in the throat or on the skin, and are responsible for other illnesses as well, such as impetigo (a skin infection).\n\n2413579: Down syndrome (DS or DNS) or Down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability.own syndrome (DS or DNS) or Down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.\n\n5535520: Plant viruses cause various types of plant diseases, but the diseases do not typically result in plant death. They do however, produce symptoms such as ringspots, mosaic pattern development, leaf yellowing and distortion, as well as deformed growth.he name of the plant disease is often related to the symptoms the disease produces in the particular plant. For example, papaya leaf curl and potato leaf roll are diseases that cause specific types of leaf distortion.\n\n1782673: Prevention of TBI is the best approach since there is no cure. Mechanisms of Injury. These mechanisms are the highest causes of brain injury: Open head Injury, Closed Head Injury, Deceleration Injuries, Chemical/Toxic, Hypoxia, Tumors, Infections and Stroke. 1. Open Head Injury.\n\n7013495: Another common cause is the treatments for cancer. Radiation and chemotherapy often cause a decrease in appetite. They can also lead to side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and mouth sores, which can affect your ability to eat normally, further contributing to weight and muscle loss.\n\n1895808: Central sensitization is a condition of the nervous system that is associated with the development and maintenance of chronic pain. When central sensitization occurs, the nervous system goes through a process called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwind-up\u00e2\u0080\u009d and gets regulated in a persistent state of high reactivity.This persistent, or regulated, state of reactivity subsequently comes to maintain pain even after the initial injury might have healed.he onset of pain is often associated with subsequent development of conditions such as depression, fear-avoidance, anxiety and other stressors. The stress of these responses can, in turn, further exacerbate the reactivity of the nervous system, leading to central sensitization.\n\n8431674: Niacin, or vitamin B3, is important to proper health, but like many food components, people can develop an allergy to it. The signs and symptoms of a niacin allergy encompass a wide variety of physical problems. These can range from a simple rash to hives, trouble with blood sugar levels, and an upset stomach or ulcers. In the event a severe allergy, some individuals bleed, pass out, and even suffer from blood clots.\n\n4349039: Overstretching of the adductor tendons is a much less common cause. Failure to stretch the adductor muscles properly puts them at increased risk for injury. Weakness of the adductor muscles is a common problem that puts these muscles at increased risk for injury, as the load to failure is much less in weaker muscles.\n\n3209989: The same thing happens when you put salt water on your skin. As the water evaporates, leaving the salt behind, it attaches to the surface of infectious cells, draws the moisture out, and kills the cells. Salts help to draw out toxins, microscopic dirt, and pollutants that get into our skin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pores over time.\n\n120954: Endotoxin vs Exotoxin. Toxigenesis is the process of producing toxins by pathogenic bacteria. It is one of main mechanisms of developing diseases by bacteria. Two kinds of toxins; i.e. endotoxins and exotoxins are produced, and those can be distinguished by their chemical nature.\n\n8012858: A subsidence of the symptoms of a disease. A relapse of symptoms. Reversion to an earlier or less mature pattern of feeling or behavior. Relapse to a less perfect or developed state. The return of a population to an earlier or less complex physical type in successive generations. The relationship between the mean value of a random variable and the corresponding values of one or more independent variables. A relative fall in sea level resulting in deposition of terrestrial strata over marine strata.\n\n4192447: If the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin, or if the body cannot use the insulin properly, blood sugar levels rise and the body cannot use foods effectively. High blood sugar levels are harmful to many body tissues. Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal problem of people with diabetes.\n\n"
