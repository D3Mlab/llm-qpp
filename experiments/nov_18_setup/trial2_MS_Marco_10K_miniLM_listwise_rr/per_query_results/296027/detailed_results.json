Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: how many space electrical panel do i need\n\nDocuments:\n\n787300: The report used land use data from 72 percent of all large solar plants installed in the U.S., and found that the total area requirements for a photovoltaic (PV) plant between 1 and 20 megawatt capacity is 8.3 acres per MW.he report used land use data from 72 percent of all large solar plants installed in the U.S., and found that the total area requirements for a photovoltaic (PV) plant between 1 and 20 megawatt capacity is 8.3 acres per MW.\n\n7676254: Does a solar panel system take up much space? How much space your solar panels take up on your roof depends on the size of your system. A single panel can have a foot print of about 4\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long and 30\u00e2\u0080\u009d wide, so an array of 8 panels can be approx. 24\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long, depending on how they are oriented.\n\n5350827: Measure your room length and width (in inches) Multiply the two and divide by 324. Example: A 12' X 12' Room 144 inches times 144 inches = 20736 square inches 20736 Divided by 324 = 64 you will need 64 tiles to do the room.easure your room length and width (in inches) Multiply the two and divide by 324. Example: A 12' X 12' Room 144 inches times 144 inches = 20736 square inches 20736 Divided by 324 = 64 you will need 64 tiles to do the room.\n\n6727891: So if your panel is 2 feet wide, the maximum size of the air gap = 2\u00e2\u0080\u0099/1.414 = 1.4\u00e2\u0080\u00b2. That corresponds to a quarter wavelength frequency of 1/4(1125/gap) = 199 Hz. Assume the acoustic panel is 6\u00e2\u0080\u00b3 thick, then the longest quarter wavelength for this absorber is closer to 2 feet, which corresponds to a frequency of 140 Hz.\n\n2868310: Solar panels are not the cheapest to install, otherwise everyone would have them. They can cost about $5 per watt, which averages out to $15,000 for the average residential system to produce 3kW. But with federal tax credits, state tax credits, and other local rebates, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll save already on the installment process.he Savings on Solar.

In general, you could save an average of $20,000 over the course of 20 years!\n\n5340707: A metal hood can be closer to the range top and is usually recommends about 26-33 space . Much higher can look odd. Min width, same as the cooking surface or larger. if Asian style cooking, wider and more powerful more necessary. A wood decor hood box should be no closer to burners than 30.\n\n1085146: If the shingles you are using come three bundles to a square, calculating the number of bundles you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need is simple. Each bundle covers 33.3 sq. ft. of roof area\u00e2\u0080\u0094close enough to the 32 sq. ft. a sheet covers. So just order one bundle for each sheet of roof sheathing. For other bundle counts per square, divide the number of sheets of sheathing by three and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the total number of squares needed to cover the roof.\n\n8284031: For the best answers, search on this site https://shorturl.im/aymth. I worked on a cruise ship, that could hold 2,501 pax and about 950 crew. We had 18 lifeboats, 16 that held 150 people (138 guests + 12 crew) and 2 that held 180 people (I think) (160 guests and 20 crew) *My numbers might be off on this one a bit. I know we had two boats that could be used as tenders or lifeboats.\n\n6152901: Standard size sets are suitable for many rooms, with a sofa length of 82 to 89 inches long. Apartment Size units are scaled to fit into more compact spaces, with a sofa length of 81 inches or less.

How much space your solar panels take up on your roof depends on the size of your system. A single panel can have a foot print of about 4\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long and 30\u00e2\u0080\u009d wide, so an array of 8 panels can be approx. 24\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long, depending on how they are oriented.\n\n5350827: Measure your room length and width (in inches) Multiply the two and divide by 324.

That corresponds to a quarter wavelength frequency of 1/4(1125/gap) = 199 Hz. Assume the acoustic panel is 6\u00e2\u0080\u00b3 thick, then the longest quarter wavelength for this absorber is closer to 2 feet, which corresponds to a frequency of 140 Hz.\n\n2868310: Solar panels are not the cheapest to install, otherwise everyone would have them. They can cost about $5 per watt, which averages out to $15,000 for the average residential system to produce 3kW.

Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 100 strings.\n\nExample output format: [<docID1>,...,<dockID100>]\n\nQuery: how many space electrical panel do i need\n\nDocuments:\n\n787300: The report used land use data from 72 percent of all large solar plants installed in the U.S., and found that the total area requirements for a photovoltaic (PV) plant between 1 and 20 megawatt capacity is 8.3 acres per MW.he report used land use data from 72 percent of all large solar plants installed in the U.S., and found that the total area requirements for a photovoltaic (PV) plant between 1 and 20 megawatt capacity is 8.3 acres per MW.\n\n7676254: Does a solar panel system take up much space? How much space your solar panels take up on your roof depends on the size of your system. A single panel can have a foot print of about 4\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long and 30\u00e2\u0080\u009d wide, so an array of 8 panels can be approx. 24\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long, depending on how they are oriented.\n\n5350827: Measure your room length and width (in inches) Multiply the two and divide by 324. Example: A 12' X 12' Room 144 inches times 144 inches = 20736 square inches 20736 Divided by 324 = 64 you will need 64 tiles to do the room.easure your room length and width (in inches) Multiply the two and divide by 324. Example: A 12' X 12' Room 144 inches times 144 inches = 20736 square inches 20736 Divided by 324 = 64 you will need 64 tiles to do the room.\n\n6727891: So if your panel is 2 feet wide, the maximum size of the air gap = 2\u00e2\u0080\u0099/1.414 = 1.4\u00e2\u0080\u00b2. That corresponds to a quarter wavelength frequency of 1/4(1125/gap) = 199 Hz. Assume the acoustic panel is 6\u00e2\u0080\u00b3 thick, then the longest quarter wavelength for this absorber is closer to 2 feet, which corresponds to a frequency of 140 Hz.\n\n2868310: Solar panels are not the cheapest to install, otherwise everyone would have them. They can cost about $5 per watt, which averages out to $15,000 for the average residential system to produce 3kW. But with federal tax credits, state tax credits, and other local rebates, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll save already on the installment process.he Savings on Solar. Going solar will affect your finances, but in a good way. The thing to look at is how much it can save you, and how soon you can start saving. In general, you could save an average of $20,000 over the course of 20 years!\n\n5340707: A metal hood can be closer to the range top and is usually recommends about 26-33 space . Much higher can look odd. Min width, same as the cooking surface or larger. if Asian style cooking, wider and more powerful more necessary. A wood decor hood box should be no closer to burners than 30.\n\n1085146: If the shingles you are using come three bundles to a square, calculating the number of bundles you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need is simple. Each bundle covers 33.3 sq. ft. of roof area\u00e2\u0080\u0094close enough to the 32 sq. ft. a sheet covers. So just order one bundle for each sheet of roof sheathing. For other bundle counts per square, divide the number of sheets of sheathing by three and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the total number of squares needed to cover the roof.\n\n8284031: For the best answers, search on this site https://shorturl.im/aymth. I worked on a cruise ship, that could hold 2,501 pax and about 950 crew. We had 18 lifeboats, 16 that held 150 people (138 guests + 12 crew) and 2 that held 180 people (I think) (160 guests and 20 crew) *My numbers might be off on this one a bit.
