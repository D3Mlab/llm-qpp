Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: when did goku first go super saiyan 4\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc21596: Goku. Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc2553137: List of Dragon Ball video games. Dragon Ball Z: Super Goku Den\u00a0\u2014 Kakusei-Hen is the second game in the Super Gokuden series. The game was released on September 22, 1995.[27] Kakusei-Hen follows the story of Goku from his fight with Piccolo at the 23rd World Tournament to his final battle with Frieza after the latter had reached the Super Saiyan state.\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc21595: Goku. Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc2521890: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn, known in Japan as The Rebirth of Fusion!! Goku and Vegeta (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u5fa9\u6d3b\u306e\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3!!\u609f\u7a7a\u3068\u30d9\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto Fukkatsu no Fy\u016bjon!! Gok\u016b to Bej\u012bta), is a Japanese animted fantasy action film and the 12th film in the Dragon Ball Z series. It was originally released in Japan on March 4, 1995 at Toei Anime Fair, and dubbed into English by Funimation in 2006, originally receiving a theatrical release along with Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler before going to DVD.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc834588: Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga and anime.\n\ndoc1715741: List of Dragon Ball characters. Though he appears human, it is later revealed that Goku is descended from an alien warrior race known as the Saiyans, who sent him, originally named Kakarrot, to Earth to prepare it for conquest.[ch.\u00a0197] Goku sacrifices his life to save the planet from his brother Raditz,[ch.\u00a0205] but must quickly get stronger in the afterlife under the tutelage of Kai\u014d-sama, to save it from the other incoming Saiyans Nappa and Vegeta. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats a powerful tyrant Freeza. This sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training. The last battle of the original manga, against Majin Boo, has the entire universe at stake, and as such, has Goku and friends being asked for help from the gods of the universe, Kai\u014d-shin.\n\ndoc21606: Goku. Afterwards, Goku and his friends participate in a fighting tournament set between Beerus and his brother Champa, facing warriors from the universe Champa oversees as its God of Destruction.[51] During this tournament, Goku reveals that he has learned to combine the perfect ki control of his Super Saiyan Blue form with his older technique, the Kai\u014d-ken; creating a variation called \"Super Saiyan Blue Kai\u014d-ken\". Although Goku gives up after fighting his opponent, Hit, his team ends up winning the tournament.[52] After meeting with the omnipotent being known as Zeno, Goku encounters an evil look-a-like of himself called \"Goku Black\", who is terrorizing Future Trunks' timeline.[53] Black is eventually revealed to be a rogue Kai named Zamasu, who has stolen Goku's body from yet another alternate timeline and teamed up with the Zamasu of Future Trunks' timeline to fulfill their \"Zero Mortals Plan\". After Zamasu and Black become even more dangerous by undergoing Potara Fusion during the battle in Future Trunks' timeline, Goku ultimately summons the future version of Zeno who erases the entire universe and Zamasu. Goku and the others present there manage to escape in their time machine, and later Goku and Future Trunks use the time machine again to bring Future Zeno to the present timeline.\n\ndoc2409391: Vegeta. In Dragon Ball GT, Vegeta is confronted by a Baby-possessed Gohan. Baby possessed Vegeta during their battle despite strong resistance by Vegeta,[56] and the resulting Baby/Vegeta fusion battles Goku.[57][58] Vegeta is later split from Baby's body before Baby is destroyed.[59] Later, he fights Super Android #17, but again, he is knocked out and nearly killed.[60] When Omega Shenron wreaks havoc, he fights with Goku as a Super Saiyan 4 but the two eventually revert to normal.[61][62] Afterwards, Vegeta says a farewell to Goku, who leaves the duty of protecting Earth in Vegeta's hands before he flies off into the sky on Shenron.[63]\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc761610: Dragon Ball. Instead of continuing the anime as Dragon Ball, Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. Dragon Ball Z (\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ(\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8), Doragon B\u014dru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.[3] Two television specials based on the Z series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Freeza -- Son Goku's Father~, renamed Bardock \u2013 The Father of Goku by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, The Hopeless Resistance!! Gohan and Trunks -- The Two Remaining Super Warriors, renamed The History of Trunks by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on March 24, 1993.\n\ndoc227804: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Just as Camori hits and destroys New Vegeta, the Z Fighters and the slaves escape in the spaceship Piccolo used to follow Goku and Vegeta. Goku and Gohan teleport straight to their garden, where they are confronted by an angry Chi-Chi, who is annoyed with Goku for leaving during the interview. Goku then comically recites what Chi-Chi told him to say for the school interview, causing her to faint.\n\ndoc2237669: Dragon Ball Super: Broly. \"This is the story of a new Saiyan. Earth is peaceful following the Tournament of Power. Realizing that the universes still hold many more strong people yet to see, Goku spends all his days training to reach even greater heights. Then one day, Goku and Vegeta are faced by a Saiyan called 'Broly' who they've never seen before. The Saiyans were supposed to have been almost completely wiped out in the destruction of Planet Vegeta, so what's this one doing on Earth? This encounter between the three Saiyans who have followed completely different destinies turns into a stupendous battle, with even Frieza (back from Hell) getting caught up in the mix.\"[2]\n\ndoc21592: Goku. As the protagonist, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT and Dragon Ball Super), as well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Goku has become one of the most recognizable and iconic characters in the world. Outside the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku appearing in the Dragon Ball Z anime, itself an adaptation of Dragon Ball manga volumes 17-42, as opposed to his initial child form, due to the limited success of the first series overseas.[3] Goku's critical reception has been largely positive and he is often considered to be the greatest manga and anime character of all time.\n\ndoc834592: Dragon Ball Super. After the tournament is completed, Future Trunks reappears and brings news of a new and powerful enemy resembling Goku that is known as Goku Black. Goku and the others eventually discover that Goku Black is actually a Kai\u014d-shin from Universe 10 named Zamasu, who hijacked Goku's body from a different timeline as part of his plan to attain immortality and wipe out all mortals.[11] In the end, Zamasu is erased along with the entire future timeline by Zen\u014d from the future, who accompanies Goku back to his timeline. Goku fulfills his promise to Zen\u014d by introducing him to his future self.\n\ndoc21615: Goku. Since the U.S. debut of Dragon Ball Z in 1996, Goku has appeared in American pop culture. He was featured in an issue of Wizard magazine in which he and Superman fought a hypothetical battle and won.[87] In the Codename: Kids Next Door episode \"Operation: R.E.P.O.R.T\", Numbuh Four's version of the story is a parody of the Goku and Freeza's battle in Dragon Ball Z.[88] Goku appears in Robot Chicken in a sketch entitled A Very Dragon Ball Z Christmas, where Goku and Gohan fight an evil Mrs. Claus with Santa's reindeer, in an attempt to save Christmas.[89] The Saturday Night Live sketch TV Funhouse titled Kobayashi depicts real-life hot-dog-eating champion Takeru Kobayashi as able to transform into a Super Saiyan as he prepares to eat hot dogs; Goku appears briefly near the end.[90] Goku is referenced in the songs \"Goku\" and \"Anime\" by Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, where he brags that he looks and feels like Goku.[91] Goku appears in a parody of the film Moneyball on an episode of Mad entitled Money Ball Z, in which Billy Beane drafts Goku and a couple of other Dragon Ball characters into the Oakland A's.[92] In 2013, he and Superman fought in a \"Death Battle\" episode of the Rooster Teeth web series ScrewAttack.[93] The episode \"Goku vs. Superman\" in the web series Epic Rap Battles of History[94] won a Streamy Award for Best Music Video.[95]\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21605: Goku. After defeating Majin Buu, Goku meets a new opponent known as Beerus, the God of Destruction in the film Battle of Gods. An alternative, more innately powerful form known as the Super Saiyan God (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo) is reached by Goku during this film. Though the temporary transformation wears off, Goku manages to harness its godly powers in his base Super Saiyan form. In its sequel film Resurrection 'F', Goku manages to achieve a blue-haired evolution of Super Saiyan God under Whis's tutelage, known as the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba), S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) or \"Super Saiyan Blue\" for short, which Goku uses to battle the newly revived Frieza.[50] These forms also appear in Dragon Ball Super and its manga tie-in, which expand upon the stories from the two films, and replace them as the new canon.\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains more power, becoming Omega Shenron and overwhelming Goku. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but then Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan 4, thanks to Bulma's new device, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta fuse, using the Fusion Dance technique, creating Gogeta, who uses his immense power to taunt Omega Shenron. However, after being too confident in their ability to defeat Omega Shenron, they use up too much time in an attempt to embarrass Omega Shenron, their fusion then ends and Goku loses his Super Saiyan 4 form along with Vegeta. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku makes a Spirit Bomb powerful enough to destroy Omega Shenron, and end the battle.\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc2237670: Dragon Ball Super: Broly. Dragon Ball Super: Broly was originally announced under the tentative title of Dragon Ball Super - The Movie on December 17, 2017, during Jump Festa with the general theme being \"The Strongest Warrior Race in the Universe, The Saiyans\".[4] A poster was released on March 13, 2018, 11 days before the airing of the final episode of Dragon Ball Super, featuring an entirely new design for the protagonist Goku by Toei animator Naohiro Shintani,[5][6] as opposed to veteran Dragon Ball character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro. One week later, the first trailer for the film was released publicly through Toei Animation featuring the all\u00e2\u20ac\u201cnew character designs and an enigmatic new villain.[7]\n\ndoc1715831: List of Dragon Ball characters. After a second defeat at the hands of the three Saiyans, Baby infects Trunks and then goes to Earth. On Earth he battles Goten and Gohan, infects them both, and is able to infect Vegeta and make him his primary host. Goku, Trunks, and Pan return to Earth to find the entire population is now under Baby's control. Baby is able to defeat Goku, then he begins using the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats Goku again. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku is able to defeat \"Baby-Vegeta\". He has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a 10x Kamehameha attack, sending it into the sun. The ship is destroyed and Baby is obliterated. He is voiced by Yusuke Numata in Japanese media and by Mike McFarland in the Funimation anime dub.\n\ndoc2237668: Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The film takes place after the Universe Survival Saga depicted in Dragon Ball Super. Under the tagline \"the greatest enemy, Saiyan\", the film will depict the fate of series protagonist Goku and Vegeta as they encounter a new Saiyan called Broly. The movie will include the connection of the Frieza army, and the history of the Saiyans.[1]\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc1715835: List of Dragon Ball characters. Broly (\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Buror\u012b) is an anime-only character that appears in the eighth, tenth, and eleventh Dragon Ball Z movies as the main villain. He was born with a power greater than most elite adult Saiyans, and is mentally unsettled as an adult, partially due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, partially because of traumatic events during his childhood (including nearly being executed for his power as well as Freeza's genocide) and partially because his power was so extreme. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\" (\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Densetsu no Ch\u014d Saiya-jin) told of in legends, with his destructive tendencies only being quelled by a special controlling device created by scientists for his father, Paragus (\u30d1\u30e9\u30ac\u30b9, Paragasu). In movie eight, after Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Future Trunks as well as Piccolo before killing his father. He is eventually defeated by Goku, but somehow manages to make his way into an escape pod. In movie ten, he lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goku's son Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten by their combined Kamehameha attack after being blasted through the sun. Though in movie eleven, blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone, \"Bio-Broly\" (\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Baio Buror\u012b). The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, transforming him into a bio-mutant of sorts. He is eventually killed by Goten, Trunks, and Kuririn. He is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese films, and Vic Mignogna in the Funimation dub.\n\ndoc2341559: Dragon Ball GT. The real Shenlong appears to grant Goku and his friends one last wish, and then proceeds to disappear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d along with Goku and the Dragon Balls. Several decades later, Goku's great-great-grandson, Goku Jr., participates in the World Tournament against Vegeta Jr., as his grandmother Pan cheers for him. Pan then sees Goku and tries to approach him but Goku disappears into the crowd. Goku then leaves the World Tournament with a flashback of his timeline. After the flashback of his timeline ends, Goku then catches his power pole and rides off on his Flying Nimbus cloud.\n\ndoc227802: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Vegeta soon loses patience with Paragus and decides to return to Earth with the others, but Goku and the others confront Paragus, having realised that Broly is in fact the Legendary Super Saiyan himself. The slaves, upon seeing Broly, also identify him as the one who destroyed their planet, but Broly again becomes fixated on Goku, and his rage erupts so much that he breaks free of the mind control device and transforms into a behemoth of a Super Saiyan: the Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly sets his eyes on Goku and begins fighting him and the others, while Vegeta, frightened of the Legendary Super Saiyan, loses the will to fight. Paragus taunts Vegeta for his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and reveals his true story and intentions: many years ago, on Planet Vegeta, Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, (but Goku was born with a power level of 2), which was an impressive feat for anyone, let alone a baby to achieve. However, King Vegeta feared that the baby would grow up to become a threat to his royal family line and ordered him executed. Paragus barged into the court and begged King Vegeta to spare him, but he refused and severely wounded Paragus. Broly was stabbed in the stomach, and he and Paragus were left for dead. However, that same day, Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, and just before the explosion, Broly manifested his anger to blast him and Paragus away from Planet Vegeta only seconds before demolition. Because of Goku's crying, the attempted execution, and having to survive the Saiyan eradication, Broly grew into a severely unstable child. At one point, he even blinded Paragus in one eye, and Paragus only managed to pacify him via the mind control device. Since then, Paragus' goal has been revenge on King Vegeta through his son, Vegeta, and to take over the Earth as a new Planet Vegeta from which to rule the entire universe. Furthermore, a comet, Camori, is approaching New Vegeta, and will destroy it upon impact.\n\ndoc227801: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. On New Vegeta, Vegeta meets Paragus' son, Broly, and the two leave together to hunt down the Legendary Super Saiyan. Gohan, Trunks and Krillin meet the planet's slaves and defend them from their abusive masters. During the struggle, Goku arrives via Instant Transmission, having followed their energy signals after King Kai's story. The slaves tell them that the Legendary Super Saiyan destroyed their planet, and they were found by Paragus, who made them into his slaves. That night, Vegeta and Broly return, having had no luck. While Vegeta receives Goku coldly, Broly appears agitated at the mere sight of him, and only calms down when Paragus raises his hand and a light shines on his bracelet. Despite this, Broly attacks Goku in the middle of the night. The two fight evenly matched for a while until Paragus appears and calms Broly down again. After the fight Goku suspects that Broly is the Legendary Super Saiyan due to their similar ki and also begins to doubt Paragus' claims. Paragus, for his part, has been controlling Broly with a mind control device, which he suspects may be malfunctioning. Paragus then realises that it is Broly's connection to Goku that has made him angry: Broly and Goku were born on the same day and were in neighbouring pods, and Goku's constant crying agitated Broly so much that it made him resent Goku for many years afterwards, and now, having come face to face with him, old wounds have begun to surface.\n\ndoc21619: Goku.

While Anime Now's Richard Eisenbeis believes Goku is determined to protect his universe, the fact that he does not care about other loser universes being destroyed also received negative response.[134] In January 2017, Nowaza won two Guinness World Records for her longevity as Goku; she has been the sole voice actor for the role for over 23 years.[135]\n\ndoc2237671: Dragon Ball Super: Broly.

During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan.

During the fray, Goten and Trunks gather the Dragon Balls, summon Shenron and ask him to put the barrier between the living and deceased worlds back up, but Shenron claims that he cannot grant the wish, since only King Yemma has that kind of power. In Hell, Goku and Janemba engage in a game-like fight, with Janemba taking the upper hand against Goku. Goku realises that despite Janemba likely not meaning any real harm, he is nevertheless a danger to both worlds, and powers up to Super Saiyan 3. In his new form, Goku dominates Janemba and literally smashes his head in, but Janemba merely transforms into a much smaller but more powerful and sinister form and again takes the upper hand, almost killing Goku, but Vegeta, having regained his physical body, arrives in time to help. Both Goku and Vegeta are no match for Janemba and are forced to hide. Goku proposes fusion, but Vegeta refuses to join bodies with Goku, given his pride.\n\ndoc21590: Goku.

The Saiyans had sent Goku (originally named \"Kakarrot\") to Earth as an infant to conquer the planet for them, but he suffered a traumatic brain injury soon after his arrival and lost all memory of his mission, as well as his blood-thirsty Saiyan nature. Goku refuses to help Raditz continue the mission, which results in Raditz kidnapping Gohan. Goku decides to team up with his former enemy Piccolo in order to defeat Raditz and save his son, while sacrificing his own life in the process. In the afterlife, Goku trains under Kai\u014d-sama until he is revived by the Dragon Balls a year later in order to save the Earth from Raditz' comrades; Nappa and the Saiyan prince Vegeta. During the battle Piccolo is killed, along with Goku's allies Yamcha, Tenshinhan and Chaozu, and the Dragon Balls cease to exist because of Piccolo's death.

During the battle, Krillin overhears Vegeta mentioning the original set of Dragon Balls from Piccolo's home planet Namek (\u30ca\u30e1\u30c3\u30af\u661f, Namekku-sei). While Goku recovers from his injuries at the hospital, Gohan, Krillin and Goku's oldest friend Bulma depart for Namek in order to use these Dragon Balls to revive their dead friends. However, they discover that Vegeta's superior, the galactic tyrant Lord Frieza, is already there, seeking the Dragon Balls to be granted eternal life. A fully healed Vegeta arrives on Namek as well, seeking the Dragon Balls for himself, which leads to several battles between him and Frieza's henchmen.

Goku appears, having been watching Vegeta's fight and summons Shenlong to ask what a Super Saiyan God is. A Super Saiyan God once appeared on planet Vegeta to stop evil Saiyans, but failed because of the form's time limit. The dragon also reveals that they need the power of six pure-hearted Saiyans for one of them to reach the Super Saiyan God form. Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan God, a form far stronger than even the Super Saiyan 3, thanks to the power of himself, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks, Goten, and Pan (from inside her mother Videl), fulfilling the prophecy once stated by the Oracle Fish. Goku confronts Beerus again and they wage an intense battle in space, right above planet Earth. The form gives Goku the power to resist Beerus, but he reverts to his regular Super Saiyan form due to its time limit. However, he learns the form's godlike feeling, which allows him to use some amount of Super Saiyan God power against Beerus. The two seem to be equally strong, but Beerus eventually decides to use his strongest attack. Goku stops the energy sphere, barely holding it back, but after Chi-Chi and Goku's friends appear in Goku's mind he is able to absorb the energy sphere and briefly transform into a Super Saiyan God once again. However, Goku is overwhelmed with exhaustion, and at Beerus' suggestion, finally admits defeat. Beerus recognizes Goku's effort and reveals that he was the second strongest person he had ever fought, after Whis, who is also his martial arts master and is even stronger than he is. Goku also learns from Beerus and Whis that there are actually other universes with other Gods of Destruction. Back on Earth, Beerus decides to spare the planet and takes his leave with Whis after bidding farewell to Goku and his friends, who return to Bulma's birthday party. It is revealed by Whis that Beerus used only 70% of his power while fighting Goku.\n\ndoc2106723: Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans.

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc2553137: List of Dragon Ball video games. Dragon Ball Z: Super Goku Den\u00a0\u2014 Kakusei-Hen is the second game in the Super Gokuden series. The game was released on September 22, 1995.[27] Kakusei-Hen follows the story of Goku from his fight with Piccolo at the 23rd World Tournament to his final battle with Frieza after the latter had reached the Super Saiyan state.\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc21595: Goku. Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc2521890: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn, known in Japan as The Rebirth of Fusion!! Goku and Vegeta (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u5fa9\u6d3b\u306e\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3!!\u609f\u7a7a\u3068\u30d9\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto Fukkatsu no Fy\u016bjon!! Gok\u016b to Bej\u012bta), is a Japanese animted fantasy action film and the 12th film in the Dragon Ball Z series. It was originally released in Japan on March 4, 1995 at Toei Anime Fair, and dubbed into English by Funimation in 2006, originally receiving a theatrical release along with Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler before going to DVD.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc834588: Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga and anime.\n\ndoc1715741: List of Dragon Ball characters. Though he appears human, it is later revealed that Goku is descended from an alien warrior race known as the Saiyans, who sent him, originally named Kakarrot, to Earth to prepare it for conquest.[ch.\u00a0197] Goku sacrifices his life to save the planet from his brother Raditz,[ch.\u00a0205] but must quickly get stronger in the afterlife under the tutelage of Kai\u014d-sama, to save it from the other incoming Saiyans Nappa and Vegeta. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats a powerful tyrant Freeza. This sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training. The last battle of the original manga, against Majin Boo, has the entire universe at stake, and as such, has Goku and friends being asked for help from the gods of the universe, Kai\u014d-shin.\n\ndoc21606: Goku. Afterwards, Goku and his friends participate in a fighting tournament set between Beerus and his brother Champa, facing warriors from the universe Champa oversees as its God of Destruction.[51] During this tournament, Goku reveals that he has learned to combine the perfect ki control of his Super Saiyan Blue form with his older technique, the Kai\u014d-ken; creating a variation called \"Super Saiyan Blue Kai\u014d-ken\". Although Goku gives up after fighting his opponent, Hit, his team ends up winning the tournament.[52] After meeting with the omnipotent being known as Zeno, Goku encounters an evil look-a-like of himself called \"Goku Black\", who is terrorizing Future Trunks' timeline.[53] Black is eventually revealed to be a rogue Kai named Zamasu, who has stolen Goku's body from yet another alternate timeline and teamed up with the Zamasu of Future Trunks' timeline to fulfill their \"Zero Mortals Plan\". After Zamasu and Black become even more dangerous by undergoing Potara Fusion during the battle in Future Trunks' timeline, Goku ultimately summons the future version of Zeno who erases the entire universe and Zamasu. Goku and the others present there manage to escape in their time machine, and later Goku and Future Trunks use the time machine again to bring Future Zeno to the present timeline.\n\ndoc2409391: Vegeta. In Dragon Ball GT, Vegeta is confronted by a Baby-possessed Gohan. Baby possessed Vegeta during their battle despite strong resistance by Vegeta,[56] and the resulting Baby/Vegeta fusion battles Goku.[57][58] Vegeta is later split from Baby's body before Baby is destroyed.[59] Later, he fights Super Android #17, but again, he is knocked out and nearly killed.[60] When Omega Shenron wreaks havoc, he fights with Goku as a Super Saiyan 4 but the two eventually revert to normal.[61][62] Afterwards, Vegeta says a farewell to Goku, who leaves the duty of protecting Earth in Vegeta's hands before he flies off into the sky on Shenron.[63]\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc761610: Dragon Ball. Instead of continuing the anime as Dragon Ball, Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. Dragon Ball Z (\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ(\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8), Doragon B\u014dru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.[3] Two television specials based on the Z series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Freeza -- Son Goku's Father~, renamed Bardock \u2013 The Father of Goku by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, The Hopeless Resistance!! Gohan and Trunks -- The Two Remaining Super Warriors, renamed The History of Trunks by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on March 24, 1993.\n\ndoc227804: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Just as Camori hits and destroys New Vegeta, the Z Fighters and the slaves escape in the spaceship Piccolo used to follow Goku and Vegeta. Goku and Gohan teleport straight to their garden, where they are confronted by an angry Chi-Chi, who is annoyed with Goku for leaving during the interview. Goku then comically recites what Chi-Chi told him to say for the school interview, causing her to faint.\n\ndoc2237669: Dragon Ball Super: Broly. \"This is the story of a new Saiyan. Earth is peaceful following the Tournament of Power. Realizing that the universes still hold many more strong people yet to see, Goku spends all his days training to reach even greater heights. Then one day, Goku and Vegeta are faced by a Saiyan called 'Broly' who they've never seen before. The Saiyans were supposed to have been almost completely wiped out in the destruction of Planet Vegeta, so what's this one doing on Earth? This encounter between the three Saiyans who have followed completely different destinies turns into a stupendous battle, with even Frieza (back from Hell) getting caught up in the mix.\"[2]\n\ndoc21592: Goku. As the protagonist, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT and Dragon Ball Super), as well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Goku has become one of the most recognizable and iconic characters in the world. Outside the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku appearing in the Dragon Ball Z anime, itself an adaptation of Dragon Ball manga volumes 17-42, as opposed to his initial child form, due to the limited success of the first series overseas.[3] Goku's critical reception has been largely positive and he is often considered to be the greatest manga and anime character of all time.\n\ndoc834592: Dragon Ball Super. After the tournament is completed, Future Trunks reappears and brings news of a new and powerful enemy resembling Goku that is known as Goku Black. Goku and the others eventually discover that Goku Black is actually a Kai\u014d-shin from Universe 10 named Zamasu, who hijacked Goku's body from a different timeline as part of his plan to attain immortality and wipe out all mortals.[11] In the end, Zamasu is erased along with the entire future timeline by Zen\u014d from the future, who accompanies Goku back to his timeline. Goku fulfills his promise to Zen\u014d by introducing him to his future self.\n\ndoc21615: Goku. Since the U.S. debut of Dragon Ball Z in 1996, Goku has appeared in American pop culture. He was featured in an issue of Wizard magazine in which he and Superman fought a hypothetical battle and won.[87] In the Codename: Kids Next Door episode \"Operation: R.E.P.O.R.T\", Numbuh Four's version of the story is a parody of the Goku and Freeza's battle in Dragon Ball Z.[88] Goku appears in Robot Chicken in a sketch entitled A Very Dragon Ball Z Christmas, where Goku and Gohan fight an evil Mrs. Claus with Santa's reindeer, in an attempt to save Christmas.[89] The Saturday Night Live sketch TV Funhouse titled Kobayashi depicts real-life hot-dog-eating champion Takeru Kobayashi as able to transform into a Super Saiyan as he prepares to eat hot dogs; Goku appears briefly near the end.[90] Goku is referenced in the songs \"Goku\" and \"Anime\" by Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, where he brags that he looks and feels like Goku.[91] Goku appears in a parody of the film Moneyball on an episode of Mad entitled Money Ball Z, in which Billy Beane drafts Goku and a couple of other Dragon Ball characters into the Oakland A's.[92] In 2013, he and Superman fought in a \"Death Battle\" episode of the Rooster Teeth web series ScrewAttack.[93] The episode \"Goku vs. Superman\" in the web series Epic Rap Battles of History[94] won a Streamy Award for Best Music Video.[95]\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21605: Goku. After defeating Majin Buu, Goku meets a new opponent known as Beerus, the God of Destruction in the film Battle of Gods. An alternative, more innately powerful form known as the Super Saiyan God (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo) is reached by Goku during this film. Though the temporary transformation wears off, Goku manages to harness its godly powers in his base Super Saiyan form. In its sequel film Resurrection 'F', Goku manages to achieve a blue-haired evolution of Super Saiyan God under Whis's tutelage, known as the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba), S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) or \"Super Saiyan Blue\" for short, which Goku uses to battle the newly revived Frieza.[50] These forms also appear in Dragon Ball Super and its manga tie-in, which expand upon the stories from the two films, and replace them as the new canon.\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains more power, becoming Omega Shenron and overwhelming Goku. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but then Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan 4, thanks to Bulma's new device, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta fuse, using the Fusion Dance technique, creating Gogeta, who uses his immense power to taunt Omega Shenron. However, after being too confident in their ability to defeat Omega Shenron, they use up too much time in an attempt to embarrass Omega Shenron, their fusion then ends and Goku loses his Super Saiyan 4 form along with Vegeta. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku makes a Spirit Bomb powerful enough to destroy Omega Shenron, and end the battle.\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc2237670: Dragon Ball Super: Broly. Dragon Ball Super: Broly was originally announced under the tentative title of Dragon Ball Super - The Movie on December 17, 2017, during Jump Festa with the general theme being \"The Strongest Warrior Race in the Universe, The Saiyans\".[4] A poster was released on March 13, 2018, 11 days before the airing of the final episode of Dragon Ball Super, featuring an entirely new design for the protagonist Goku by Toei animator Naohiro Shintani,[5][6] as opposed to veteran Dragon Ball character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro. One week later, the first trailer for the film was released publicly through Toei Animation featuring the all\u00e2\u20ac\u201cnew character designs and an enigmatic new villain.[7]\n\ndoc1715831: List of Dragon Ball characters. After a second defeat at the hands of the three Saiyans, Baby infects Trunks and then goes to Earth. On Earth he battles Goten and Gohan, infects them both, and is able to infect Vegeta and make him his primary host. Goku, Trunks, and Pan return to Earth to find the entire population is now under Baby's control. Baby is able to defeat Goku, then he begins using the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats Goku again. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku is able to defeat \"Baby-Vegeta\". He has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a 10x Kamehameha attack, sending it into the sun. The ship is destroyed and Baby is obliterated. He is voiced by Yusuke Numata in Japanese media and by Mike McFarland in the Funimation anime dub.\n\ndoc2237668: Dragon Ball Super: Broly. The film takes place after the Universe Survival Saga depicted in Dragon Ball Super. Under the tagline \"the greatest enemy, Saiyan\", the film will depict the fate of series protagonist Goku and Vegeta as they encounter a new Saiyan called Broly. The movie will include the connection of the Frieza army, and the history of the Saiyans.[1]\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc1715835: List of Dragon Ball characters. Broly (\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Buror\u012b) is an anime-only character that appears in the eighth, tenth, and eleventh Dragon Ball Z movies as the main villain. He was born with a power greater than most elite adult Saiyans, and is mentally unsettled as an adult, partially due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, partially because of traumatic events during his childhood (including nearly being executed for his power as well as Freeza's genocide) and partially because his power was so extreme. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\" (\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Densetsu no Ch\u014d Saiya-jin) told of in legends, with his destructive tendencies only being quelled by a special controlling device created by scientists for his father, Paragus (\u30d1\u30e9\u30ac\u30b9, Paragasu). In movie eight, after Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Future Trunks as well as Piccolo before killing his father. He is eventually defeated by Goku, but somehow manages to make his way into an escape pod. In movie ten, he lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goku's son Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten by their combined Kamehameha attack after being blasted through the sun. Though in movie eleven, blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone, \"Bio-Broly\" (\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Baio Buror\u012b). The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, transforming him into a bio-mutant of sorts. He is eventually killed by Goten, Trunks, and Kuririn. He is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese films, and Vic Mignogna in the Funimation dub.\n\ndoc2341559: Dragon Ball GT. The real Shenlong appears to grant Goku and his friends one last wish, and then proceeds to disappear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d along with Goku and the Dragon Balls. Several decades later, Goku's great-great-grandson, Goku Jr., participates in the World Tournament against Vegeta Jr., as his grandmother Pan cheers for him. Pan then sees Goku and tries to approach him but Goku disappears into the crowd. Goku then leaves the World Tournament with a flashback of his timeline. After the flashback of his timeline ends, Goku then catches his power pole and rides off on his Flying Nimbus cloud.\n\ndoc227802: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Vegeta soon loses patience with Paragus and decides to return to Earth with the others, but Goku and the others confront Paragus, having realised that Broly is in fact the Legendary Super Saiyan himself. The slaves, upon seeing Broly, also identify him as the one who destroyed their planet, but Broly again becomes fixated on Goku, and his rage erupts so much that he breaks free of the mind control device and transforms into a behemoth of a Super Saiyan: the Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly sets his eyes on Goku and begins fighting him and the others, while Vegeta, frightened of the Legendary Super Saiyan, loses the will to fight. Paragus taunts Vegeta for his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and reveals his true story and intentions: many years ago, on Planet Vegeta, Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, (but Goku was born with a power level of 2), which was an impressive feat for anyone, let alone a baby to achieve. However, King Vegeta feared that the baby would grow up to become a threat to his royal family line and ordered him executed. Paragus barged into the court and begged King Vegeta to spare him, but he refused and severely wounded Paragus. Broly was stabbed in the stomach, and he and Paragus were left for dead. However, that same day, Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, and just before the explosion, Broly manifested his anger to blast him and Paragus away from Planet Vegeta only seconds before demolition. Because of Goku's crying, the attempted execution, and having to survive the Saiyan eradication, Broly grew into a severely unstable child. At one point, he even blinded Paragus in one eye, and Paragus only managed to pacify him via the mind control device. Since then, Paragus' goal has been revenge on King Vegeta through his son, Vegeta, and to take over the Earth as a new Planet Vegeta from which to rule the entire universe. Furthermore, a comet, Camori, is approaching New Vegeta, and will destroy it upon impact.\n\ndoc227801: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. On New Vegeta, Vegeta meets Paragus' son, Broly, and the two leave together to hunt down the Legendary Super Saiyan. Gohan, Trunks and Krillin meet the planet's slaves and defend them from their abusive masters. During the struggle, Goku arrives via Instant Transmission, having followed their energy signals after King Kai's story. The slaves tell them that the Legendary Super Saiyan destroyed their planet, and they were found by Paragus, who made them into his slaves. That night, Vegeta and Broly return, having had no luck. While Vegeta receives Goku coldly, Broly appears agitated at the mere sight of him, and only calms down when Paragus raises his hand and a light shines on his bracelet. Despite this, Broly attacks Goku in the middle of the night. The two fight evenly matched for a while until Paragus appears and calms Broly down again. After the fight Goku suspects that Broly is the Legendary Super Saiyan due to their similar ki and also begins to doubt Paragus' claims. Paragus, for his part, has been controlling Broly with a mind control device, which he suspects may be malfunctioning. Paragus then realises that it is Broly's connection to Goku that has made him angry: Broly and Goku were born on the same day and were in neighbouring pods, and Goku's constant crying agitated Broly so much that it made him resent Goku for many years afterwards, and now, having come face to face with him, old wounds have begun to surface.\n\ndoc21619: Goku.

While Anime Now's Richard Eisenbeis believes Goku is determined to protect his universe, the fact that he does not care about other loser universes being destroyed also received negative response.[134] In January 2017, Nowaza won two Guinness World Records for her longevity as Goku; she has been the sole voice actor for the role for over 23 years.[135]\n\ndoc2237671: Dragon Ball Super: Broly.

During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan.

During the fray, Goten and Trunks gather the Dragon Balls, summon Shenron and ask him to put the barrier between the living and deceased worlds back up, but Shenron claims that he cannot grant the wish, since only King Yemma has that kind of power. In Hell, Goku and Janemba engage in a game-like fight, with Janemba taking the upper hand against Goku. Goku realises that despite Janemba likely not meaning any real harm, he is nevertheless a danger to both worlds, and powers up to Super Saiyan 3. In his new form, Goku dominates Janemba and literally smashes his head in, but Janemba merely transforms into a much smaller but more powerful and sinister form and again takes the upper hand, almost killing Goku, but Vegeta, having regained his physical body, arrives in time to help. Both Goku and Vegeta are no match for Janemba and are forced to hide. Goku proposes fusion, but Vegeta refuses to join bodies with Goku, given his pride.\n\ndoc21590: Goku.

However, he back flips and uses the charge up energy to slide over her attack and launches his Kamehameha at point-blank range. Goku blasts Kefla out of the ring and eliminates her. Her Potara earrings shatter, and she splits back into Kale and Caulifla. With both of them eliminated, Saonel and Pirina are the only remaining warriors from Team Universe 6.\n\ndoc2493019: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy.

The Saiyans had sent Goku (originally named \"Kakarrot\") to Earth as an infant to conquer the planet for them, but he suffered a traumatic brain injury soon after his arrival and lost all memory of his mission, as well as his blood-thirsty Saiyan nature. Goku refuses to help Raditz continue the mission, which results in Raditz kidnapping Gohan. Goku decides to team up with his former enemy Piccolo in order to defeat Raditz and save his son, while sacrificing his own life in the process. In the afterlife, Goku trains under Kai\u014d-sama until he is revived by the Dragon Balls a year later in order to save the Earth from Raditz' comrades; Nappa and the Saiyan prince Vegeta. During the battle Piccolo is killed, along with Goku's allies Yamcha, Tenshinhan and Chaozu, and the Dragon Balls cease to exist because of Piccolo's death. Goku arrives at the battlefield late, but avenges his fallen friends by defeating Nappa with his new level of power. Vegeta himself enters into the battle with Goku and after numerous clashes, Goku manages to defeat him as well, with the help of Gohan and his best friend Krillin. At Goku's request, they spare Vegeta's life and allow him to escape Earth. During the battle, Krillin overhears Vegeta mentioning the original set of Dragon Balls from Piccolo's home planet Namek (\u30ca\u30e1\u30c3\u30af\u661f, Namekku-sei). While Goku recovers from his injuries at the hospital, Gohan, Krillin and Goku's oldest friend Bulma depart for Namek in order to use these Dragon Balls to revive their dead friends. However, they discover that Vegeta's superior, the galactic tyrant Lord Frieza, is already there, seeking the Dragon Balls to be granted eternal life.

Goku appears, having been watching Vegeta's fight and summons Shenlong to ask what a Super Saiyan God is. A Super Saiyan God once appeared on planet Vegeta to stop evil Saiyans, but failed because of the form's time limit. The dragon also reveals that they need the power of six pure-hearted Saiyans for one of them to reach the Super Saiyan God form. Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan God, a form far stronger than even the Super Saiyan 3, thanks to the power of himself, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks, Goten, and Pan (from inside her mother Videl), fulfilling the prophecy once stated by the Oracle Fish. Goku confronts Beerus again and they wage an intense battle in space, right above planet Earth. The form gives Goku the power to resist Beerus, but he reverts to his regular Super Saiyan form due to its time limit. However, he learns the form's godlike feeling, which allows him to use some amount of Super Saiyan God power against Beerus. The two seem to be equally strong, but Beerus eventually decides to use his strongest attack. Goku stops the energy sphere, barely holding it back, but after Chi-Chi and Goku's friends appear in Goku's mind he is able to absorb the energy sphere and briefly transform into a Super Saiyan God once again. However, Goku is overwhelmed with exhaustion, and at Beerus' suggestion, finally admits defeat. Beerus recognizes Goku's effort and reveals that he was the second strongest person he had ever fought, after Whis, who is also his martial arts master and is even stronger than he is. Goku also learns from Beerus and Whis that there are actually other universes with other Gods of Destruction. Back on Earth, Beerus decides to spare the planet and takes his leave with Whis after bidding farewell to Goku and his friends, who return to Bulma's birthday party. It is revealed by Whis that Beerus used only 70% of his power while fighting Goku.\n\ndoc2106723: Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans.

She said she had to be mindful of the fact that Goku grew up in the mountains and did not know much of the world. Despite having to voice Goku, Gohan, Goten and Bardock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image.[27] Nozawa explained that she did not read the manga so that she would not know what was coming in the story until recording, making her reactions the same as Goku's.[28]\n\ndoc83780: Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball Z follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku who, along with his companions, defends the Earth against an assortment of villains ranging from intergalactic space fighters and conquerors, unnaturally powerful androids and nearly indestructible creatures. While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from his childhood into adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels the maturation of his sons, Gohan and Goten, as well as the evolution of his rivals Piccolo and Vegeta from enemies into allies.\n\ndoc2341556: Dragon Ball GT. Baby has the ability to invade other people's bodies and turn them into Tuffles, as well as using a body to combine it with his own power and become a fighter. After turning practically all of the Earth's population, including the Saiyans, into Tuffles, Baby decides to remain inside Vegeta's body and use it to confront Goku. Goku fights him and is defeated, but after having his tail regenerated, transforms, achieving the power of Super Saiyan 4 (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin F\u014d), and destroys Baby, propelling him into the sun with a Kamehameha Wave. Piccolo then sacrifices himself to turn the Black Star Dragon Balls into stone permanently when the Earth explodes after Goku and the others helped everyone evacuate to the Tuffle Planet.\n\ndoc2553135: List of Dragon Ball video games.

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc2553137: List of Dragon Ball video games. Dragon Ball Z: Super Goku Den\u00a0\u2014 Kakusei-Hen is the second game in the Super Gokuden series. The game was released on September 22, 1995.[27] Kakusei-Hen follows the story of Goku from his fight with Piccolo at the 23rd World Tournament to his final battle with Frieza after the latter had reached the Super Saiyan state.\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc21595: Goku. Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc2521890: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn, known in Japan as The Rebirth of Fusion!! Goku and Vegeta (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u5fa9\u6d3b\u306e\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3!!\u609f\u7a7a\u3068\u30d9\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto Fukkatsu no Fy\u016bjon!! Gok\u016b to Bej\u012bta), is a Japanese animted fantasy action film and the 12th film in the Dragon Ball Z series. It was originally released in Japan on March 4, 1995 at Toei Anime Fair, and dubbed into English by Funimation in 2006, originally receiving a theatrical release along with Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler before going to DVD.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc834588: Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga and anime.\n\ndoc1715741: List of Dragon Ball characters. Though he appears human, it is later revealed that Goku is descended from an alien warrior race known as the Saiyans, who sent him, originally named Kakarrot, to Earth to prepare it for conquest.[ch.\u00a0197] Goku sacrifices his life to save the planet from his brother Raditz,[ch.\u00a0205] but must quickly get stronger in the afterlife under the tutelage of Kai\u014d-sama, to save it from the other incoming Saiyans Nappa and Vegeta. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats a powerful tyrant Freeza. This sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training. The last battle of the original manga, against Majin Boo, has the entire universe at stake, and as such, has Goku and friends being asked for help from the gods of the universe, Kai\u014d-shin.\n\ndoc21606: Goku. Afterwards, Goku and his friends participate in a fighting tournament set between Beerus and his brother Champa, facing warriors from the universe Champa oversees as its God of Destruction.[51] During this tournament, Goku reveals that he has learned to combine the perfect ki control of his Super Saiyan Blue form with his older technique, the Kai\u014d-ken; creating a variation called \"Super Saiyan Blue Kai\u014d-ken\". Although Goku gives up after fighting his opponent, Hit, his team ends up winning the tournament.[52] After meeting with the omnipotent being known as Zeno, Goku encounters an evil look-a-like of himself called \"Goku Black\", who is terrorizing Future Trunks' timeline.[53] Black is eventually revealed to be a rogue Kai named Zamasu, who has stolen Goku's body from yet another alternate timeline and teamed up with the Zamasu of Future Trunks' timeline to fulfill their \"Zero Mortals Plan\". After Zamasu and Black become even more dangerous by undergoing Potara Fusion during the battle in Future Trunks' timeline, Goku ultimately summons the future version of Zeno who erases the entire universe and Zamasu. Goku and the others present there manage to escape in their time machine, and later Goku and Future Trunks use the time machine again to bring Future Zeno to the present timeline.\n\ndoc2409391: Vegeta. In Dragon Ball GT, Vegeta is confronted by a Baby-possessed Gohan. Baby possessed Vegeta during their battle despite strong resistance by Vegeta,[56] and the resulting Baby/Vegeta fusion battles Goku.[57][58] Vegeta is later split from Baby's body before Baby is destroyed.[59] Later, he fights Super Android #17, but again, he is knocked out and nearly killed.[60] When Omega Shenron wreaks havoc, he fights with Goku as a Super Saiyan 4 but the two eventually revert to normal.[61][62] Afterwards, Vegeta says a farewell to Goku, who leaves the duty of protecting Earth in Vegeta's hands before he flies off into the sky on Shenron.[63]\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc761610: Dragon Ball. Instead of continuing the anime as Dragon Ball, Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. Dragon Ball Z (\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ(\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8), Doragon B\u014dru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.[3] Two television specials based on the Z series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Freeza -- Son Goku's Father~, renamed Bardock \u2013 The Father of Goku by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, The Hopeless Resistance!! Gohan and Trunks -- The Two Remaining Super Warriors, renamed The History of Trunks by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on March 24, 1993.\n\ndoc227804: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Just as Camori hits and destroys New Vegeta, the Z Fighters and the slaves escape in the spaceship Piccolo used to follow Goku and Vegeta. Goku and Gohan teleport straight to their garden, where they are confronted by an angry Chi-Chi, who is annoyed with Goku for leaving during the interview. Goku then comically recites what Chi-Chi told him to say for the school interview, causing her to faint.\n\ndoc2237669: Dragon Ball Super: Broly. \"This is the story of a new Saiyan. Earth is peaceful following the Tournament of Power. Realizing that the universes still hold many more strong people yet to see, Goku spends all his days training to reach even greater heights. Then one day, Goku and Vegeta are faced by a Saiyan called 'Broly' who they've never seen before. The Saiyans were supposed to have been almost completely wiped out in the destruction of Planet Vegeta, so what's this one doing on Earth? This encounter between the three Saiyans who have followed completely different destinies turns into a stupendous battle, with even Frieza (back from Hell) getting caught up in the mix.\"[2]\n\ndoc21592: Goku. As the protagonist, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT and Dragon Ball Super), as well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Goku has become one of the most recognizable and iconic characters in the world. Outside the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku appearing in the Dragon Ball Z anime, itself an adaptation of Dragon Ball manga volumes 17-42, as opposed to his initial child form, due to the limited success of the first series overseas.[3] Goku's critical reception has been largely positive and he is often considered to be the greatest manga and anime character of all time.\n\ndoc834592: Dragon Ball Super. After the tournament is completed, Future Trunks reappears and brings news of a new and powerful enemy resembling Goku that is known as Goku Black. Goku and the others eventually discover that Goku Black is actually a Kai\u014d-shin from Universe 10 named Zamasu, who hijacked Goku's body from a different timeline as part of his plan to attain immortality and wipe out all mortals.[11] In the end, Zamasu is erased along with the entire future timeline by Zen\u014d from the future, who accompanies Goku back to his timeline. Goku fulfills his promise to Zen\u014d by introducing him to his future self.\n\ndoc21615: Goku. Since the U.S. debut of Dragon Ball Z in 1996, Goku has appeared in American pop culture. He was featured in an issue of Wizard magazine in which he and Superman fought a hypothetical battle and won.[87] In the Codename: Kids Next Door episode \"Operation: R.E.P.O.R.T\", Numbuh Four's version of the story is a parody of the Goku and Freeza's battle in Dragon Ball Z.[88] Goku appears in Robot Chicken in a sketch entitled A Very Dragon Ball Z Christmas, where Goku and Gohan fight an evil Mrs. Claus with Santa's reindeer, in an attempt to save Christmas.[89] The Saturday Night Live sketch TV Funhouse titled Kobayashi depicts real-life hot-dog-eating champion Takeru Kobayashi as able to transform into a Super Saiyan as he prepares to eat hot dogs; Goku appears briefly near the end.[90] Goku is referenced in the songs \"Goku\" and \"Anime\" by Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, where he brags that he looks and feels like Goku.[91] Goku appears in a parody of the film Moneyball on an episode of Mad entitled Money Ball Z, in which Billy Beane drafts Goku and a couple of other Dragon Ball characters into the Oakland A's.[92] In 2013, he and Superman fought in a \"Death Battle\" episode of the Rooster Teeth web series ScrewAttack.[93] The episode \"Goku vs. Superman\" in the web series Epic Rap Battles of History[94] won a Streamy Award for Best Music Video.[95]\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21605: Goku. After defeating Majin Buu, Goku meets a new opponent known as Beerus, the God of Destruction in the film Battle of Gods. An alternative, more innately powerful form known as the Super Saiyan God (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo) is reached by Goku during this film. Though the temporary transformation wears off, Goku manages to harness its godly powers in his base Super Saiyan form. In its sequel film Resurrection 'F', Goku manages to achieve a blue-haired evolution of Super Saiyan God under Whis's tutelage, known as the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba), S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) or \"Super Saiyan Blue\" for short, which Goku uses to battle the newly revived Frieza.[50] These forms also appear in Dragon Ball Super and its manga tie-in, which expand upon the stories from the two films, and replace them as the new canon.\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains more power, becoming Omega Shenron and overwhelming Goku. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but then Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan 4, thanks to Bulma's new device, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta fuse, using the Fusion Dance technique, creating Gogeta, who uses his immense power to taunt Omega Shenron. However, after being too confident in their ability to defeat Omega Shenron, they use up too much time in an attempt to embarrass Omega Shenron, their fusion then ends and Goku loses his Super Saiyan 4 form along with Vegeta. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku makes a Spirit Bomb powerful enough to destroy Omega Shenron, and end the battle.\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc2237670: Dragon Ball Super: Broly. Dragon Ball Super: Broly was originally announced under the tentative title of Dragon Ball Super - The Movie on December 17, 2017, during Jump Festa with the general theme being \"The Strongest Warrior Race in the Universe, The Saiyans\".[4] A poster was released on March 13, 2018, 11 days before the airing of the final episode of Dragon Ball Super, featuring an entirely new design for the protagonist Goku by Toei animator Naohiro Shintani,[5][6] as opposed to veteran Dragon Ball character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro.

After a second defeat at the hands of the three Saiyans, Baby infects Trunks and then goes to Earth. On Earth he battles Goten and Gohan, infects them both, and is able to infect Vegeta and make him his primary host. Goku, Trunks, and Pan return to Earth to find the entire population is now under Baby's control. Baby is able to defeat Goku, then he begins using the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats Goku again. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku is able to defeat \"Baby-Vegeta\". He has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a 10x Kamehameha attack, sending it into the sun. The ship is destroyed and Baby is obliterated. He is voiced by Yusuke Numata in Japanese media and by Mike McFarland in the Funimation anime dub.\n\ndoc2237668: Dragon Ball Super: Broly.

The movie will include the connection of the Frieza army, and the history of the Saiyans.[1]\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc1715835: List of Dragon Ball characters. Broly (\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Buror\u012b) is an anime-only character that appears in the eighth, tenth, and eleventh Dragon Ball Z movies as the main villain. He was born with a power greater than most elite adult Saiyans, and is mentally unsettled as an adult, partially due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, partially because of traumatic events during his childhood (including nearly being executed for his power as well as Freeza's genocide) and partially because his power was so extreme. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\" (\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Densetsu no Ch\u014d Saiya-jin) told of in legends, with his destructive tendencies only being quelled by a special controlling device created by scientists for his father, Paragus (\u30d1\u30e9\u30ac\u30b9, Paragasu). In movie eight, after Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Future Trunks as well as Piccolo before killing his father. He is eventually defeated by Goku, but somehow manages to make his way into an escape pod. In movie ten, he lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goku's son Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten by their combined Kamehameha attack after being blasted through the sun. Though in movie eleven, blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone, \"Bio-Broly\" (\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Baio Buror\u012b). The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, transforming him into a bio-mutant of sorts. He is eventually killed by Goten, Trunks, and Kuririn. He is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese films, and Vic Mignogna in the Funimation dub.\n\ndoc2341559: Dragon Ball GT. The real Shenlong appears to grant Goku and his friends one last wish, and then proceeds to disappear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d along with Goku and the Dragon Balls. Several decades later, Goku's great-great-grandson, Goku Jr., participates in the World Tournament against Vegeta Jr., as his grandmother Pan cheers for him. Pan then sees Goku and tries to approach him but Goku disappears into the crowd. Goku then leaves the World Tournament with a flashback of his timeline. After the flashback of his timeline ends, Goku then catches his power pole and rides off on his Flying Nimbus cloud.\n\ndoc227802: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Vegeta soon loses patience with Paragus and decides to return to Earth with the others, but Goku and the others confront Paragus, having realised that Broly is in fact the Legendary Super Saiyan himself. The slaves, upon seeing Broly, also identify him as the one who destroyed their planet, but Broly again becomes fixated on Goku, and his rage erupts so much that he breaks free of the mind control device and transforms into a behemoth of a Super Saiyan: the Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly sets his eyes on Goku and begins fighting him and the others, while Vegeta, frightened of the Legendary Super Saiyan, loses the will to fight. Paragus taunts Vegeta for his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and reveals his true story and intentions: many years ago, on Planet Vegeta, Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, (but Goku was born with a power level of 2), which was an impressive feat for anyone, let alone a baby to achieve. However, King Vegeta feared that the baby would grow up to become a threat to his royal family line and ordered him executed. Paragus barged into the court and begged King Vegeta to spare him, but he refused and severely wounded Paragus. Broly was stabbed in the stomach, and he and Paragus were left for dead. However, that same day, Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, and just before the explosion, Broly manifested his anger to blast him and Paragus away from Planet Vegeta only seconds before demolition. Because of Goku's crying, the attempted execution, and having to survive the Saiyan eradication, Broly grew into a severely unstable child. At one point, he even blinded Paragus in one eye, and Paragus only managed to pacify him via the mind control device. Since then, Paragus' goal has been revenge on King Vegeta through his son, Vegeta, and to take over the Earth as a new Planet Vegeta from which to rule the entire universe. Furthermore, a comet, Camori, is approaching New Vegeta, and will destroy it upon impact.\n\ndoc227801: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. On New Vegeta, Vegeta meets Paragus' son, Broly, and the two leave together to hunt down the Legendary Super Saiyan. Gohan, Trunks and Krillin meet the planet's slaves and defend them from their abusive masters. During the struggle, Goku arrives via Instant Transmission, having followed their energy signals after King Kai's story. The slaves tell them that the Legendary Super Saiyan destroyed their planet, and they were found by Paragus, who made them into his slaves. That night, Vegeta and Broly return, having had no luck. While Vegeta receives Goku coldly, Broly appears agitated at the mere sight of him, and only calms down when Paragus raises his hand and a light shines on his bracelet. Despite this, Broly attacks Goku in the middle of the night. The two fight evenly matched for a while until Paragus appears and calms Broly down again. After the fight Goku suspects that Broly is the Legendary Super Saiyan due to their similar ki and also begins to doubt Paragus' claims. Paragus, for his part, has been controlling Broly with a mind control device, which he suspects may be malfunctioning. Paragus then realises that it is Broly's connection to Goku that has made him angry: Broly and Goku were born on the same day and were in neighbouring pods, and Goku's constant crying agitated Broly so much that it made him resent Goku for many years afterwards, and now, having come face to face with him, old wounds have begun to surface.\n\ndoc21619: Goku. Goku was ranked number one in IGN's 2009 Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time[115] and reappeared on the same list in 2014, however, on this occasion they ranked him third, with Cowboy Bebop's Spike Spiegel and Neon Genesis Evangelion's Shinji Ikari placed above him, saying that \"He was, in many ways, a character that bucked the trends of his time and defined the direction of shonen manga/anime for decades.\"[116] In Mania Entertainment's 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes, Thomas Zoth commented that \"Goku and Dragon Ball completely revolutionized sh\u014dnen manga.\"[117] In a Newtype poll from March 2010, Goku was voted the fifth most popular male character from the 1980s.[118] Goku ranked consistently high in the Anime Grand Prix poll in the category of \"best male character\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s, appearing seventeenth in the 1987 poll,[119] fifteenth in the 1988 poll,[120] second in the 1989 poll,[121] fourth in the 1990 poll,[122] third in the 1991 poll,[123] fourth in the 1992 poll,[124] thirteenth in 1993 poll,[125] and twelfth in 1994 poll.[126] In a 1993 character popularity poll for the series, Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump readers voted Goku second, after his son Gohan.[127] He came in first in the magazine's 1995 poll,[127] as well as in a 2004 poll amongst fans of the series for the book Dragon Ball Forever.[128] In a 2005 The Daily Reader article entitled \"The Greatest Geek Movie Heroes of All Time\", Goku is the only animated character listed, and is ranked tenth.[129] In a survey of 1,000 people, conducted by Oricon in 2007, Goku ranked first place as the \"Strongest Manga character of all time.\"[130] In the survey \"Friendship\" developed by rankingjapan.com, in which people chose which anime character they would like as a friend, Goku ranked fifth.[131] In 2000, Goku placed third in an Animax poll of favorite anime characters.[132] NTT customers voted him as their third favorite black haired male anime character.[133] Despite his positive reception, Goku also received negative feedback for his characterization in Dragon Ball Super due to how his constant desires for fighting stronger enemies resulted in setting up a story where all universe could be destroyed. While Anime Now's Richard Eisenbeis believes Goku is determined to protect his universe, the fact that he does not care about other loser universes being destroyed also received negative response.[134] In January 2017, Nowaza won two Guinness World Records for her longevity as Goku; she has been the sole voice actor for the role for over 23 years.[135]\n\ndoc2237671: Dragon Ball Super: Broly.

They also liked the way the series' depict his entire adventures, making him a good main character.[104] Rationalmagic.com praised Goku's innocence as one of the funniest parts of the series.[105] According to Julius Weideman, Goku's journey and ever-growing strength resulted in the character winning \"the admiration of young boys everywhere.\"[106] In 2015, the Japan Anniversary Association officially declared May 9 as \"Goku Day\" (\u609f\u7a7a\u306e\u65e5, Gok\u016b no hi). In Japanese the numbers 5 and 9 can be pronounced as \"Go\" and \"Ku\" respectively.[107] Jason Thompson stated that unlike the \"manly\" heroes of other popular sh\u014dnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, Toriyama made his protagonist (Goku) cartoonish and small, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day.[108] One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda and Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto said that Goku inspired their protagonists as well as series structure.[109][110] Commenting on Goku's popularity, Kishimoto stated that when people hear the name \"Son Goku\", no longer do they think of the Journey to the West character, but instead Dragon Ball's protagonist comes to mind.[111] Additionally, for the second half of the series, Kishimoto created an ape named Son Goku in reference to Toriyama's character to the point the ape has four tails just like the four-star Dragon Ball Goku earned from his grandfather.[112]\n\ndoc227800: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan.

Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues.[90][91][92] Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS\uff08\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\uff09, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta).\n\ndoc2521893: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Earth comes under siege by an array of villains, one of them a comical parody of Adolf Hitler and his Wehrmacht, as well as an army of deceased past villains led by Frieza. Gohan makes quick work of Frieza, causing the villains to scatter. During the fray, Goten and Trunks gather the Dragon Balls, summon Shenron and ask him to put the barrier between the living and deceased worlds back up, but Shenron claims that he cannot grant the wish, since only King Yemma has that kind of power. In Hell, Goku and Janemba engage in a game-like fight, with Janemba taking the upper hand against Goku. Goku realises that despite Janemba likely not meaning any real harm, he is nevertheless a danger to both worlds, and powers up to Super Saiyan 3. In his new form, Goku dominates Janemba and literally smashes his head in, but Janemba merely transforms into a much smaller but more powerful and sinister form and again takes the upper hand, almost killing Goku, but Vegeta, having regained his physical body, arrives in time to help. Both Goku and Vegeta are no match for Janemba and are forced to hide. Goku proposes fusion, but Vegeta refuses to join bodies with Goku, given his pride.\n\ndoc21590: Goku. Son Goku (Japanese: \u5b6b \u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Son Gok\u016b) is a fictional character and main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong, a main character in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West.

He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the wish-granting Dragon Balls.\n\ndoc2544563: Frieza. Before the start of the series, Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta, as Beerus asked him to do so, out of both fear of a potential uprising by the Saiyans due to their increasing power and the prophecy of the coming of the legendary Super Saiyan. Frieza spares only Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz, offering them wealth for their loyalty. However, when Raditz's father made a final stand when Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, he did not notice the Saiyan's second son being sent to Earth where he became known as Goku.\n\ndoc311106: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Goku begins his fight with Frieza and Cell, and it is clear that Goku is far stronger than both of them combined. He kills both of them quickly, but they come back to life. Since they are already dead, Goku can never kill them. They trap Goku in a cage of energy, and force him down into the depths of hell. There, he is tortured in various ways, finally being trapped in a block of ice. Back on Earth, Gohan is fighting General Rilldo, and Rilldo hits him with his metal beam, turning Gohan's right arm into metal. Trunks and Goten are exterminating Saibamen, while Vegeta deals with the new Android 17. The original 17 locates Krillin, Marron, and Android 18.

The dragon also reveals that they need the power of six pure-hearted Saiyans for one of them to reach the Super Saiyan God form.

Goku confronts Beerus again and they wage an intense battle in space, right above planet Earth. The form gives Goku the power to resist Beerus, but he reverts to his regular Super Saiyan form due to its time limit. However, he learns the form's godlike feeling, which allows him to use some amount of Super Saiyan God power against Beerus. The two seem to be equally strong, but Beerus eventually decides to use his strongest attack. Goku stops the energy sphere, barely holding it back, but after Chi-Chi and Goku's friends appear in Goku's mind he is able to absorb the energy sphere and briefly transform into a Super Saiyan God once again.
