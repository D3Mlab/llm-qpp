The surgeon then uses very small micro blades or fine needles to puncture the sites for receiving the grafts, placing them in a predetermined density and pattern, and angling the wounds in a consistent fashion to promote a realistic hair pattern. The technicians generally do the final part of the procedure, inserting the individual grafts in place.\n\ndoc51695: Hair transplantation. Transplant operations are performed on an outpatient basis, with mild sedation (optional) and injected local anesthesia. The scalp is shampooed and then treated with an antibacterial agent prior to the donor scalp being harvested.\n\ndoc51707: Hair transplantation. There are a number of applications for hair transplant surgery, including:\n\ndoc51691: Hair transplantation. Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding, (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp. Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.\n\ndoc51697: Hair transplantation. There are two main ways in which donor grafts are extracted today: strip excision harvesting, and follicular unit extraction.\n\ndoc51714: Hair transplantation. Advancing the theory of donor dominance, Walter P. Unger, M.D. defined the parameters of the \"Safe Donor Zone\" from which the most permanent hair follicles could be extracted for hair transplantation.[11] As transplanted hair will only grow in its new site for as long as it would have in its original one, these parameters continue to serve as the fundamental foundation for hair follicle harvesting, whether by strip method or FUE.\n\ndoc51719: Hair transplantation. Stem cells and dermal papilla cells have been discovered in hair follicles. Research on these follicular cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through hair multiplication (HM), also known as hair cloning.\n\ndoc51713: Hair transplantation. The modern era of hair transplantation in the western world was ushered in the late 1950s, when New York dermatologist Norman Orentreich began to experiment with free donor grafts to balding areas in patients with male pattern baldness. Previously it had been thought that transplanted hair would thrive no more than the original hair at the \"recipient\" site. Orentreich demonstrated that such grafts were \"donor dominant,\" as the new hairs grew and lasted just as they would have at their original home.[10]\n\ndoc51708: Hair transplantation. If donor hair numbers from the back of the head are insufficient, it is possible to perform body hair transplantation (BHT) on appropriate candidates who have available donor hair on the chest, back, shoulders, torso and/or legs. Body hair transplant surgery can only be performed by the FUE harvesting method and, so, requires the skills of an experienced FUE surgeon. However, there are several factors for a potential BHT candidate to consider prior to surgery. These include understanding the natural difference in textural characteristics between body hair and scalp hair, growth rates, and having realistic expectations about the results of BHT surgery.\n\ndoc51710: Hair transplantation. During the first ten days, some of the transplanted hairs, inevitably traumatized by their relocation, may fall out. This is referred to as \"shock loss\". After two to three months new hair will begin to grow from the moved follicles. The patient's hair will grow normally, and continue to thicken through the next six to nine months. Any subsequent hair loss is likely to be only from untreated areas. Some patients elect to use medications to retard such loss, while others plan a subsequent transplant procedure to deal with this eventuality.\n\ndoc51692: Hair transplantation. Since hair naturally grows in groupings of 1 to 4 hairs, current techniques harvest and transplant hair \"follicular units\" in their natural groupings. Thus modern hair transplantation can achieve a natural appearance by mimicking original hair orientation. This hair transplant procedure is called follicular unit transplantation (FUT). Donor hair can be harvested in two different ways: strip harvesting, and follicular unit extraction (FUE).\n\ndoc51693: Hair transplantation. At an initial consultation, the surgeon analyzes the patient's scalp, discusses their preferences and expectations, and advises them on the best approach (e.g. single vs. multiple sessions) and what results might reasonably be expected. Pre-operative folliscopy will help to know the actual existing density of hair, so that postoperative results of newly transplanted hair grafts can be accurately assessed. Some patients may benefit with preoperative topical minoxidil application and vitamins.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51709: Hair transplantation. Advances in wound care allow for semi-permeable dressing, which allow seepage of blood and tissue fluid, to be applied and changed at least daily. The vulnerable recipient area must be shielded from the sun, and shampooing is started two days after the surgery. Some surgeons will have the patient shampoo the day after surgery. Shampooing is important to prevent scabs from forming around the hair shaft. Scabs adhere to the hair shaft and increase the risk of losing newly transplanted hair follicles during the first 7 to 10 days post-op.\n\ndoc865325: Hair follicle. While hair transplantation dates back to the 1950s,[18] and plucked human hair follicle cell culture in vitro to the early 1980s,[19] it was not until 1995 when hair transplantation using individual follicular units was introduced into medical literature.[20]\n\ndoc51696: Hair transplantation. There are several different techniques for harvesting hair follicles, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Regardless of the harvesting technique, proper extraction of the hair follicle is paramount to ensure the viability of the transplanted hair and avoid transection, the cutting of the hair shaft from the hair follicle. Hair follicles grow at a slight angle to the skin's surface, so transplanted tissue must be removed at a corresponding angle.\n\ndoc83001: Pattern hair loss. More advanced cases may be resistant or unresponsive to medical therapy and require hair transplantation. Naturally occurring units of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are excised and moved to areas of hair restoration.[23] These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in close proximity and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained from either follicular unit transplantation (FUT) or follicular unit extraction (FUE). In the former, a strip of skin with follicular units is extracted and dissected into individual follicular unit grafts. The surgeon then implants the grafts into small incisions, called recipient sites.[25][26] Cosmetic scalp tattoos can also mimic the appearance of a short, buzzed haircut.\n\ndoc51717: Hair transplantation. The follicular unit hair transplant procedure has continued to evolve, becoming more refined and minimally invasive as the size of the graft incisions have become smaller. These smaller and less invasive incisions enable surgeons to place a larger number of follicular unit grafts into a given area. With the new \"gold standard\" of ultra refined follicular unit hair transplantation, over 50 grafts can be placed per square centimeter, when appropriate for the patient.[13]\n\ndoc51701: Hair transplantation. With Follicular Unit Extraction or FUE harvesting, individual follicular units containing 1 to 4 hairs are removed under local anesthesia; this micro removal typically uses tiny punches of between 0.6mm and 1.0mm in diameter. The surgeon then uses very small micro blades or fine needles to puncture the sites for receiving the grafts, placing them in a predetermined density and pattern, and angling the wounds in a consistent fashion to promote a realistic hair pattern. The technicians generally do the final part of the procedure, inserting the individual grafts in place.\n\ndoc51700: Hair transplantation. Strip harvesting will leave a thin linear scar in the donor area, which is typically covered by a patient's hair even at relatively short lengths. The recovery period is around 2 weeks and will require the stitches/staples to be removed by medical personnel or sub cuticular suturing can be done.\n\ndoc865324: Hair follicle. Hair follicles form the basis of the two primary methods of hair transplantation in hair restoration, Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and follicular unit extraction (FUE). In each of these methods, naturally occurring groupings of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are extracted from the hair restoration patient and then surgically implanted in the balding area of the patient's scalp, known as the recipient area. These follicles are extracted from donor areas of the scalp, or other parts of the body, which are typically resistant to the miniaturization effects of the hormone DHT. It is this miniaturization of the hair shaft that is the primary predictive indicator of androgenetic alopecia,[17] commonly referred to as male pattern baldness or male hair loss. When these DHT-resistant follicles are transplanted to the recipient area, they continue to grow hair in the normal hair cycle, thus providing the hair restoration patient with permanent, naturally-growing hair. More than 60% of men and 10% of women suffer from hair loss.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51712: Hair transplantation. The use of both scalp flaps, in which a band of tissue with its original blood supply is shifted to the continue bald area, and free grafts dates back to the 19th century. In 1897, Menahem Hodara successfully implanted hair taken from the unaffected areas of the scalp on to the scars that were left bald by favus. Modern transplant techniques began in Japan in the 1930s,[9] where surgeons used small grafts, and even \"follicular unit grafts\" to replace damaged areas of eyebrows or lashes, but not to treat baldness. Their efforts did not receive worldwide attention at the time, and the traumas of World War II kept their advances isolated for another two decades.\n\ndoc51705: Hair transplantation. Follicular unit transplant (FUT) is the traditional hair transplant method which involves extracting a linear strip of hair bearing skin from the back or the side of the scalp. The strip is then dissected to separate individual grafts.\n\ndoc51704: Hair transplantation. Disadvantages include increased surgical times and higher cost to the patient.[4] It is challenging for new surgeons because the procedure is physically demanding and the learning curve to acquire the skills necessary is lengthy and tough.[5] Some surgeons note that FUE can lead to a lower ratio of successfully transplanted follicles as compared to strip harvesting.\n\ndoc51698: Hair transplantation. Strip harvesting is the most common technique for removing hair and follicles from a donor site. The surgeon harvests a strip of skin from the posterior scalp, in an area of good hair growth. A single-, double-, or triple-bladed scalpel is used to remove strips of hair-bearing tissue from the donor site. Each incision is planned so that intact hair follicles are removed. The excised strip is about 1\u20131.5 x 15\u201330\u00a0cm in size. While closing the resulting wound, assistants begin to dissect individual follicular unit grafts, which are small, naturally formed groupings of hair follicles, from the strip. Working with binocular Stereo-microscopes, they carefully remove excess fibrous and fatty tissue while trying to avoid damage to the follicular cells that will be used for grafting. The latest method of closure is called 'Trichophytic closure' which results in much finer scars at the donor area.\n\ndoc51715: Hair transplantation. For the next twenty years, surgeons worked on transplanting smaller grafts, but results were only minimally successful, with 2\u20134\u00a0mm \"plugs\" leading to a doll's head-like appearance. In the 1980s, strip excisions began to replace the plug technique, and Carlos Uebel in Brazil popularized using large numbers of small grafts, while in the United States William Rassman began using thousands of \u201cmicrografts\u201d in a single session.[12]\n\ndoc51716: Hair transplantation. In the late 1980s, B.L. Limmer introduced the use of the stereo-microscope to dissect a single donor strip into small micrografts.\n\ndoc2127331: Moustache. In the Middle East, there is a growing trend for moustache transplants, which involves undergoing a procedure called follicular unit extraction in order to attain fuller, and more impressive facial hair.[12]\n\ndoc51711: Hair transplantation. Hair thinning, known as \"shock loss\", is a common side effect that is usually temporary. Bald patches are also common, as fifty to a hundred hairs can be lost each day. Post-operative hiccups have also been seen in around 5% of transplant patients.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51706: Hair transplantation. Robotic hair restoration devices utilize cameras and robotic arms to assist the surgeon with the FUE procedure. In 2009, NeoGraft became the first robotic surgical device FDA approved for hair restoration.[6] The ARTAS System was FDA approved in 2011 for use in harvesting follicular units from brown-haired and black-haired men.[7] Despite the advantages of robotic hair restoration systems, there are still some disadvantages such as the size of the punches being relatively large in comparison to what is used in other methods of FUE, and the high costs associated with the devices.[8]\n\ndoc51694: Hair transplantation. For several days prior to surgery the patient refrains from using any medicines which might result in intraoperative bleeding and resultant poor grafting. Alcohol and smoking can contribute to poor graft survival. Post operative antibiotics are commonly prescribed to prevent wound or graft infections.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51718: Hair transplantation. Surgeons have also devoted more attention to the angle and orientation of the transplanted grafts. The adoption of the \u201clateral slit\u201d technique in the early 2000s, enabled hair transplant surgeons to orient 2 to 4 hair follicular unit grafts so that they splay out across the scalp's surface. This enabled the transplanted hair to lie better on the scalp and provide better coverage to the bald areas. One disadvantage however, is that lateral incisions also tend to disrupt the scalp's vascularity more than sagittals. Thus sagittal incisions transect less hairs and blood vessels assuming the cutting instruments are of the same size. One of the big advantages of sagittals is that they do a much better job of sliding in and around existing hairs to avoid follicle transection. This certainly makes a strong case for physicians who do not require shaving of the recipient area. The lateral incisions bisect existing hairs perpendicular (horizontal) like a T while sagittal incisions run parallel (vertical) alongside and in between existing hairs. The use of perpendicular (lateral/coronal) slits versus parallel (sagittal) slits, however, has been heavily debated in patient-based hair transplant communities. Many elite hair transplant surgeons typically adopt a combination of both methods based on what is best for the individual patient.\n\ndoc904776: Facial hair in the military. (Details unknown.)\n\ndoc51703: Hair transplantation. FUE can give very natural results. The advantage over strip harvesting is that FUE harvesting negates the need for large areas of scalp tissue to be harvested, so there is no linear incision on the back of the head and it doesn't leave a linear scar. Because individual follicles are removed, only small, punctate scars remain which are virtually not visible and any post-surgical pain and discomfort is minimized. As no suture removal is required, recovery from Micro Grafting FUE is less than 7 days.\n\ndoc1358287: Hair (musical). Rado described the inspiration for Hair as \"a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long\".[2] He recalled, \"There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.\u00c2\u00a0... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.\"[8] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street.[2] Rado said, \"It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage.\"[4]\n\ndoc1798470: Hair. Cut hair may be used in wigs. Global imports of hair in 2010 was worth $US 1.24 billion.[53]\n\ndoc715369: Abdominal hair. Disperse hair growth on the abdomen\n\ndoc518556: Haircut (album). The following personnel are credited on the album:[1]\n\ndoc1746539: Human hair growth. On the scalp, the hair is usually known to be lost around the hair line, leaving the densest amount of hair at the crown. Small vellus hair will often replace the hair that is lost.\n\ndoc1490669: Wig. It takes generally six heads of hair to make a full human hair wig.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51702: Hair transplantation. FUE takes place in a single long session or multiple small sessions. The FUE procedure is more time consuming than strip surgery. An FUE surgery time varies according to the surgeons experience, speed in harvesting and patient characteristics. The procedue can take anywhere from a couple hours to extract 200 grafts for a scar correction to a surgery over two consecutive days for a megasession of 2,500 to 3,000 grafts.[1] With the FUE Hair Transplant procedure there are restrictions on patient candidacy.[2] Clients are selected for FUE based on a fox test,[3] though there is some debate about the usefulness of this in screening clients for FUE.\n\ndoc1358398: Hair (musical). Hair has been performed in most of the countries of the world. After the Berlin Wall fell, the show traveled for the first time to Poland, Lebanon, the Czech Republic and Sarajevo (featured on ABC's Nightline with Ted Koppel, when Phil Alden Robinson visited that city in 1996 and discovered a production of Hair there in the midst of the war).[183] In 1999, Michael Butler and director Bo Crowell helped produce Hair in Russia at the Stas Namin Theatre located in Moscow's Gorky Park. The Moscow production caused a similar reaction as the original did 30\u00c2\u00a0years earlier because Russian soldiers were fighting in Chechnya at the time.[237][238]\n\ndoc2135476: Professional wrestling match types. While most wrestlers (especially female wrestlers) end up growing their hair back out, in some cases the wrestler may tend to keep a shaved head as part of their look. For instance, Angle's kayfabe explanation was that he could not regrow it despite using Rogaine, hair tonic, and even fertilizer. (In reality, he was already going bald naturally, with many jokes about his receding hair line having been made on TV long before his head was shaved; his then-wife Karen had wanted Angle to shave his head. Angle would briefly regrow it for his role in the movie Warrior before shaving it again.[45] Some, such as Molly Holly and CM Punk, wore wigs or masks to hide their head until enough hair has grown back in for them to forego wearing a wig or mask.\n\ndoc1358362: Hair (musical). Excerpts from the title song, \"Hair\"\n\ndoc1746527: Human hair growth. The growth of human hair occurs everywhere on the body except for the soles of the feet, the lips, palms of the hands, some external genital areas, the navel, scar tissue, and, apart from eyelashes, the eyelids.[citation needed] Like skin, hair is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium made of multi-layered flat cells whose rope-like filaments provide structure and strength to the hair shaft.\n\ndoc563628: United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. The recruits are given the opportunity to phone their next of kin and inform them of the recruit's safe arrival, then are searched for contraband. They are issued utility and physical training uniforms and toiletries. From here, the males receive their first military haircut, where they are left essentially bald. Females are instructed in the authorized hairstyling, which allows hair to be short enough to not touch the collar or in a bun.\n\ndoc1358376: Hair (musical). A movie version of Hair, with a screenplay by Michael Weller, was directed by Milo\u0161 Forman and released in 1979. Filmed primarily in New York City's Central Park and Washington Square Park,[170] the cast includes Treat Williams, Beverly D'Angelo, John Savage, Foley and Golden.[171] Several of the songs were deleted, and the film's storyline departs significantly from the musical. The character of Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from Oklahoma, newly arrived in New York to join the military, and Sheila is a high-society debutante who catches his eye. In perhaps the greatest diversion from the stage version, a mistake leads Berger to go to Vietnam in Claude's place, where he is killed.[172]\n\ndoc1358295: Hair (musical). Papp declined to pursue a Broadway production, and so Butler produced the show himself. For a time it seemed that Butler would be unable to secure a Broadway theater, as the Shuberts, Nederlanders and other theater owners deemed the material too controversial. However, Butler had family connections and knew important people; he persuaded Biltmore Theatre owner David Cogan to make his venue available.[26]\n\ndoc1798429: Hair. Hair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucus membranes and glabrous skin, such as that found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips.\n\ndoc713467: Alopecia areata. The objective assessment of treatment efficacy is very difficult and spontaneous remission is unpredictable, but if the affected area is patched, the hair may regrow spontaneously in many cases.[20] None of the existing therapeutic options are curative or preventive.[20]\n\ndoc529595: Janice Rand. He also developed her hair styles for the series, which Roddenberry insisted must be unique and futuristic so that the viewers could believe they were seeing the future on television.[9] She originally appeared with straight hair in promotion photos,[6] but this was changed to a beehive, which was so solid looking that Bob Justman joked that \"You could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent.\"[9] It was created by weaving two Max Factor wigs into a mesh cone.[10] Whitney described the application of the wig, saying \"they nailed it to my head every morning.\"[11] It was created by placing a cone on her head and then weaving the blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that Whitney said she was unrecognizable without it.[12] In the press, she explained that on the show, Rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have made up her hair instantly.[13] The wig was later stolen from the Desilu lot after Whitney was no longer on the series; it was never recovered.[5]\n\ndoc2158599: Khrystyne Haje. Haje was born in Santa Clara, California and has four brothers. Haje is a founding board member of the Earth Communication Office (ECO), which helps to protect ecosystems. She appeared on the March 23, 2012 episode of the Rachael Ray Show to have her hair cut as part of National Donate Your Hair Day (April 27) for women with cancer.[5]\n\ndoc1798426: Hair. Hair growth begins inside the hair follicle. The only \"living\" portion of the hair is found in the follicle. The hair that is visible is the hair shaft, which exhibits no biochemical activity and is considered \"dead\". The base of a hair's root (the \"bulb\") contains the cells that produce the hair shaft.[8] Other structures of the hair follicle include the oil producing sebaceous gland which lubricates the hair and the arrector pili muscles, which are responsible for causing hairs to stand up. In humans with little body hair, the effect results in goose bumps.\n\ndoc2179093: Hair (Hair song). The song was also covered in Australia in 1969 and released as a single by Doug Parkinson in Focus (B-side with \"Without You\") and was a top ten hit for him there that year.[12]\n\ndoc2179090: Hair (Hair song). \"Hair\" is the title song to the 1968 musical Hair and the 1979 film adaptation of the musical.\n\ndoc1358311: Hair (musical). The West Coast version played at the Aquarius Theater in Los Angeles beginning about six months after the Broadway opening and running for an unprecedented two years. The Los Angeles tribe included Rado, Ragni, Robert Rothman, Ben Vereen (who replaced Ragni), Red Shepard, Ted Neeley (who replaced Rado), Meat Loaf, Gloria Jones, T\u00c3\u00a1ta Vega, Jobriath, Jennifer Warnes, and Dobie Gray.[5]\n\ndoc1483156: Hairspray (2007 film). Tory Gardner and his company Alterian, Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on John Travolta. Costume designer Rita Ryack wanted to put Edna into several revealing outfits, so Travolta ended up being encapsulated in prosthetics. He wore silicone prosthetics on his head and neck, and foam latex arms and legs that connected to a spandex and foam body suit.[citation needed]\n\ndoc62451: Laser hair removal. In some countries, including the U.S., hair removal is an unregulated procedure that anyone can do. In some places, only doctors and doctor-supervised personnel can do it, while in other cases permission extends to licensed professionals, such as regular nurses, physician assistants, estheticians, and/or cosmetologists.[21]\n\ndoc82987: Pattern hair loss. Management may include simply accepting the condition.[1] Otherwise, treatments may include minoxidil, finasteride, or hair transplant surgery.[1] Evidence for finasteride in women, however, is poor and it may result in birth defects if taken during pregnancy.[1]\n\ndoc2155695: Tonsure. From Ibnu 'Umar (he says), the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 saw a boy whose head shaven on some parts and let the hair grow on other parts. Then, the Prophet commands, \"Shave the head entirely or let the hair grow entirely\" \nHadith Ahmad II/88, Hadith Abu Dawud no. 4195, and Hadith An-Nasa-i no.5048)[non-primary source needed]\n\ndoc1358372: Hair (musical). An Acapulco, Mexico production of Hair, directed by Castelli,[44] played in 1969 for one\u00c2\u00a0night. After the performance, the theater, located across the street from a popular local bordello, was padlocked by the government, which said the production was \"detrimental to the morals of youth.\"[85] The cast was arrested soon after the performance and taken to Immigration, where they agreed to leave the country, but because of legal complications they were forced to go into hiding.[162] They were expelled from Mexico days later.[163][164]\n\ndoc1358393: Hair (musical). A U.S. National Tour of the production began on October 21, 2010. Principals included Steel Burkhardt as Berger, Paris Remillard as Claude and Caren Lyn Tackett as Sheila.[223] The tour received mostly positive reviews.[219] The show returned to Broadway for an engagement at the St. James Theatre from July 5 through September 10, 2011. After that stop, the tour resumed.[224] The tour ended on January 29, 2012.[225]\n\ndoc713470: Alopecia areata. In most cases which begin with a small number of patches of hair loss, hair grows back after a few months to a year.[7] In cases with a greater number of patches, hair can either grow back or progress to alopecia areata totalis or, in rare cases, alopecia areata universalis.[7]\n\ndoc1490674: Wig. Hair type is the distinguishing factor in human hair wigs. Four main types of hair are used in manufacturing\u00c2\u00a0: Chinese or \"Malaysian\", Indian, Indonesian or \"Brazilian\", and Caucasian or \"European\". The majority of human hair wigs are made of Chinese or Indian hair, while European hair is considered the most expensive and rare, as most donors are from Russia or Northern Europe, where there is a smaller portion of hair donors to the market.\n\ndoc713450: Alopecia areata. There is no cure for the condition.[2] Efforts may be used to try to speed hair regrowth such as cortisone injections.[1][2] Sunscreen, head coverings to protect from cold and sun, and glasses if the eyelashes are missing is recommended.[2] In some cases the hair regrows and the condition does not reoccur.[2] In others hair loss and regrowth occurs over years.[2] Among those in whom all body hair is lost less than 10% recover.[4]\n\ndoc1746540: Human hair growth. Human hair follicles are very sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy administered to the head, most commonly used to treat cancerous growths within the brain.  Hair shedding may start as soon as two weeks after the first dose of radiation and will continue for a couple of weeks.  Hair follicles typically enter the resting telogen phase and regrowth should commence 2.5 to 3 months after the hair begins to shed.  Regrowth may be sparser after treatment.\n\ndoc713476: Alopecia areata. In 2014, preliminary findings showing that oral ruxolitinib, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis, restored hair growth in three individuals with long-standing and severe disease.[26] The medicine costs almost USD $10,000 a month.[27]\n\ndoc1358392: Hair (musical). When the Broadway cast transferred to London for the 2010 West-End revival, a mostly new tribe took over on Broadway on March 9, 2010, including former American Idol finalists Ace Young as Berger and Diana DeGarmo as Sheila. Kyle Riabko assumed the role of Claude, Annaleigh Ashford played Jeanie, and Vanessa Ray was Chrissie. Rachel Bay Jones later played Mother and other roles.[220] Sales decreased after the original cast transferred to London, and the revival closed on June 27, 2010, after 29 previews and 519 regular performances.[221][222]\n\ndoc95641: Human hair color. Natural black hair\n\ndoc1746534: Human hair growth. At some point, the follicle will begin to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will be shed. Within two weeks the new hair shaft will begin to emerge once the telogen phase is complete. The process results in normal hair loss known as shedding.\n\ndoc83000: Pattern hair loss. Minoxidil dilates small blood vessels; it is not clear how this causes hair to grow.[22] Other treatments include tretinoin combined with minoxidil, ketoconazole shampoo, spironolactone,[23] alfatradiol, and topilutamide (fluridil).[24]\n\ndoc1358353: Hair (musical). RCA Victor also released DisinHAIRited (RCA Victor LSO-1163): an album of songs that had been written for the show, but saw varying amounts of stage time. Some of the songs were cut between the Public and Broadway, some had been left off the original cast album due to space, and a few were never performed onstage.[111]\n\ndoc1490666: Wig. Natural hair, either human or from an animal such as a goat or yak, must be carefully sorted so that the direction of growth is maintained, root to root, and point to point. Because of the scale-like structure of the cuticle of a hair shaft, if some hairs get turned the wrong way, they will ride backwards against their neighbors and cause tangles and matting. The highest quality of hair has never been bleached or colored, and has been carefully sorted to ensure the direction is correct. This process is called \"turning\". For less expensive wigs, this labour-intensive sorting process is substituted by \"processing\" the hair. It is treated with a strong base solution which partially dissolves the cuticle leaving the strands smooth. It is then bleached and dyed to the required shade and given a synthetic resin finish which partially restores the strength and luster of the now damaged hair. Synthetic fiber, of course, is simply manufactured in the required colors, and has no direction.\n\ndoc865307: Hair follicle. The hair follicle is a dynamic organ found in mammalian skin.[1] It resides in the dermal layer of the skin and is made up of 20 different cell types, each with distinct functions. The hair follicle regulates hair growth via a complex interaction between hormones, neuropeptides and immune cells.[1] This complex interaction induces the hair follicle to produce different types of hair as seen on different parts of the body. For example, terminal hairs grow on the scalp and lanugo hairs are seen covering the bodies of fetuses in utero and in some new born babies.[1] The process of hair growth occurs in distinct sequential stages. The first stage is called anagen and is the active growth phase, catagen is the resting stage, telogen is the regression of the hair follicle phase, exogen is the active shedding of hair phase and lastly kenogen is the phase between the empty hair follicle and the growth of new hair.[1]\n\ndoc1490664: Wig. Making custom wigs starts with measuring the subject's head. The natural hair is arranged in flat curls against the head as the various measurements are taken. It is often helpful to make a pattern from layers of transparent adhesive tape applied over a piece of plastic wrap, on which the natural hairline can be traced accurately. These measurements are then transferred to the \"block\", a wooden or cork-stuffed canvas form the same size and shape as the client's head.[17][18]\n\ndoc2179092: Hair (Hair song). The song was a major hit for The Cowsills in 1969 and their most successful single. (The Cowsills version cuts out most of the religion-themed lyrics, changing \"long as God can grow it\" to \"long as I can grow it\" and removing some verses.) Their version spent two weeks at #1 on the Cash Box Top 100[9] and reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.[10] It also reached #1 on the RPM Canadian Singles Chart.[11]\n\ndoc1358370: Hair (musical). In April 1971, a\u00a0bomb was thrown at the exterior of a theater in Cleveland, Ohio that had been housing a production, bouncing off the marquee and shattering windows in the building and in nearby storefronts.[156] That same month, the families of cast member Jonathon Johnson and stage manager Rusty Carlson died in a fire in the Cleveland hotel where 33 members of the show's troupe had been staying.[157][158] The Sydney, Australia production's opening night was interrupted by a\u00a0bomb\u00a0scare in June 1969.[159]\n\ndoc1798436: Hair. This is a method which classifies the hair by curl pattern, hair-strand thickness and overall hair volume.\n\ndoc2298644: Labia. Views on pubic hair differ between people and between cultures. Some women prefer the look or feel of pubic hair, while others may choose to remove some or all of it. Temporary methods of removal include shaving, trimming, waxing, sugaring and depilatory products while permanent hair removal can be accomplished using electrolysis or laser hair removal.[11] In Korea, pubic hair is considered a sign of fertility, leading some women to have pubic hair transplants.[6]\n\ndoc1746533: Human hair growth. During the telogen or resting phase (also known as shedding phase) the follicle remains dormant for one to four months. Ten to fifteen percent of the hairs on one's head are in this phase of growth at any given time. In this phase the epidermal cells lining the follicle channel continue to grow as normal and may accumulate around the base of the hair, temporarily anchoring it in place and preserving the hair for its natural purpose without taxing the body's resources needed during the growth phase.\n\ndoc2043159: Ear hair. Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles in the dermis, or skin. With the exception of areas of glabrous skin, the human body is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. It is an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin.\n\ndoc1538650: Long hair. Humans, horses, and orangutans are among the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are believed to have lost their fur 2.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair).[citation needed] The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).\n\ndoc1358385: Hair (musical).

Most chemotherapy drugs work by attacking fast-replicating cells. Rapid cell replication is one of the hallmarks of cancer; however, hair follicle cells also grow and divide quickly. Consequently, the chemotherapy drugs usually inhibit hair growth.  The dose and type of medicine determine the severity of hair loss, but once the chemotherapy has ended, new hair growth may begin after three to 10 weeks.\n\ndoc1490671: Wig. The subject's natural hair is again knotted tightly against the head and the wig is applied. Any remaining superfluous wiglace is trimmed away. Hairpins can be used to secure the lace to the hair and occasionally, skin-safe adhesives are used to adhere the wig against bald skin and to better hide any exposed lace. Finishing touches are done to the hair styling to achieve the desired effect.[18]\n\ndoc1358394: Hair (musical). The 2009 Broadway production was duplicated at the Gielgud Theatre in London's West End. Previews began on April 1, 2010, with an official opening on April 14. The producers were the Public Theater, together with Cameron Mackintosh and Broadway Across America. Nearly all of the New York cast relocated to London, but Luther Creek played Woof.[226][227] The London revival closed on September 4, 2010.[228]\n\ndoc1975123: Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy induced hair loss occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can manifest as alopecia totalis, telogen effluvium, or less often alopecia areata.[81] It is usually associated with systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss,[82][83] although permanent cases can occur.[84] Chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men.[85]\n\ndoc700910: Hair cell.

Soldiers are however by practice allowed to grow beards during service abroad, for example in Afghanistan.\n\ndoc865322: Hair follicle. The telogen phase is the resting phase of the hair follicle.[15] When the body is subjected to extreme stress, as much as 70 percent of hair can prematurely enter the telogen phase and begin to fall, causing a noticeable loss of hair. This condition is called telogen effluvium.[16] The club hair is the final product of a hair follicle in the telogen stage, and is a dead, fully keratinized hair.[8]  Fifty to one-hundred club hair are shed daily from a normal scalp.[8]\n\ndoc713455: Alopecia areata. When healthy hair is pulled out, at most a few should come out, and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp. In cases of alopecia areata, hair will tend to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the body's immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy.[10]\n\ndoc2654323: Bunraku. The preparation of the hair constitutes an art in and of itself. The hair distinguishes the character and can also indicate certain personality traits. The hair is made from human hair, however yak tail can be added to create volume. The ensemble is then fixed on a copper plate. To ensure that the puppet head is not damaged, the finishing of the hairstyle is made with water and bee's wax, not oil.[6]\n\ndoc1358377: Hair (musical). Rado and Ragni were unhappy with the film, feeling that Forman portrayed the hippies as \"oddballs\" and \"some sort of aberration\" without any connection to the peace movement, failing to capture the essence of the original stage production.[173] They stated: \"Any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original Biltmore version, other than some of the songs, the names of the characters, and a common title, eludes us.\"[173] In their view, the screen version of Hair has not yet been produced.[173]\n\ndoc2179094: Hair (Hair song). A version by Dutch rock band Zen reached the top of the Dutch Top 40 in January 1969.[13]\n\ndoc1358291: Hair (musical). Hair premiered off-Broadway at the Public on October 17, 1967, and ran for a limited engagement of six weeks. The lead roles were played by Walker Daniels as Claude, Ragni as Berger, Jill O'Hara as Sheila, Steve Dean as Woof, Arnold Wilkerson as Hud, Sally Eaton as Jeanie and Shelley Plimpton as Crissy.[17] Set design was by Ming Cho Lee, costume design by Theoni Aldredge, and although Anna Sokolow began rehearsals as choreographer, Freedman received choreographer credit.[18] Although the production had a \"tepid critical reception\", it was popular with audiences.[16] A cast album was released in 1967.[19]\n\ndoc1798427: Hair. The root of the hair ends in an enlargement, the hair bulb, which is whiter in color and softer in texture than the shaft, and is lodged in a follicular involution of the epidermis called the hair follicle. Bulb of hair layers consist of fibrous connective tissue, glassy membrane, external root sheath, internal root sheath composed of epithelium stratum (Henle's layer) and granular stratum (Huxley's layer), cuticle, cortex and medulla of hair.[9]\n\ndoc2407745: Hairdresser. In ancient Egypt, hairdressers had specially decorated cases to hold their tools, including lotions, scissors and styling materials. Barbers also worked as hairdressers, and wealthy men often had personal barbers within their home. With the standard of wig wearing within the culture, wigmakers were also trained as hairdressers. In ancient Rome and Greece household slaves and servants took on the role of hairdressers, including dyeing and shaving.  Men who did not have their own private hair or shaving services would visit the local barbershop. Women had their hair maintained and groomed at their homes. Historical documentation is lacking regarding hairstylists from the 5th century until the 14th century. Hair care service grew in demand after a  papal decree in 1092 demanded that all Roman Catholic clergymen remove their facial hair.[1]\n\ndoc1311605: Mohawk people. The traditional hairstyle of the Mohawk, and other tribes of the Iroquois, was to remove the hair from the head by plucking (not shaving) tuft by tuft of hair until all that was left was a square of hair on the back crown of the head. The remaining hair was shortened so that three short braids of hair were created, and those braids were highly decorated. This true \"Mohawk\" hairstyle is not to be confused with the version in popular Western culture, which is actually taken from the Pawnee.\n\ndoc2002185: Barber. In previous times, barbers (known as barber surgeons) also performed surgery and dentistry. With the development of safety razors and the decreasing prevalence of beards, in English-speaking cultures, most barbers now specialize in cutting men's scalp hair as opposed to facial hair.\n\ndoc865321: Hair follicle. The catagen phase is a short transition stage that occurs at the end of the anagen phase.[14] It signals the end of the active growth of a hair. This phase lasts for about 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 weeks while the hair converts to a club hair.\nA club hair is formed during the catagen phase when the part of the hair follicle in contact with the lower portion of the hair becomes attached to the hair shaft. This process cuts the hair off from its blood supply and from the cells that produce new hair. When a club hair is completely formed, about a 2-week process, the hair follicle enters the telogen phase.\n\n"

The technicians generally do the final part of the procedure, inserting the individual grafts in place.\n\ndoc51695: Hair transplantation. Transplant operations are performed on an outpatient basis, with mild sedation (optional) and injected local anesthesia. The scalp is shampooed and then treated with an antibacterial agent prior to the donor scalp being harvested.\n\ndoc51707: Hair transplantation. There are a number of applications for hair transplant surgery, including:\n\ndoc51691: Hair transplantation. Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding, (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp. Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.\n\ndoc51697: Hair transplantation. There are two main ways in which donor grafts are extracted today: strip excision harvesting, and follicular unit extraction.\n\ndoc51714: Hair transplantation. Advancing the theory of donor dominance, Walter P. Unger, M.D. defined the parameters of the \"Safe Donor Zone\" from which the most permanent hair follicles could be extracted for hair transplantation.[11] As transplanted hair will only grow in its new site for as long as it would have in its original one, these parameters continue to serve as the fundamental foundation for hair follicle harvesting, whether by strip method or FUE.\n\ndoc51719: Hair transplantation. Stem cells and dermal papilla cells have been discovered in hair follicles. Research on these follicular cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through hair multiplication (HM), also known as hair cloning.\n\ndoc51713: Hair transplantation. The modern era of hair transplantation in the western world was ushered in the late 1950s, when New York dermatologist Norman Orentreich began to experiment with free donor grafts to balding areas in patients with male pattern baldness. Previously it had been thought that transplanted hair would thrive no more than the original hair at the \"recipient\" site. Orentreich demonstrated that such grafts were \"donor dominant,\" as the new hairs grew and lasted just as they would have at their original home.[10]\n\ndoc51708: Hair transplantation. If donor hair numbers from the back of the head are insufficient, it is possible to perform body hair transplantation (BHT) on appropriate candidates who have available donor hair on the chest, back, shoulders, torso and/or legs. Body hair transplant surgery can only be performed by the FUE harvesting method and, so, requires the skills of an experienced FUE surgeon. However, there are several factors for a potential BHT candidate to consider prior to surgery. These include understanding the natural difference in textural characteristics between body hair and scalp hair, growth rates, and having realistic expectations about the results of BHT surgery.\n\ndoc51710: Hair transplantation. During the first ten days, some of the transplanted hairs, inevitably traumatized by their relocation, may fall out. This is referred to as \"shock loss\". After two to three months new hair will begin to grow from the moved follicles. The patient's hair will grow normally, and continue to thicken through the next six to nine months. Any subsequent hair loss is likely to be only from untreated areas. Some patients elect to use medications to retard such loss, while others plan a subsequent transplant procedure to deal with this eventuality.\n\ndoc51692: Hair transplantation. Since hair naturally grows in groupings of 1 to 4 hairs, current techniques harvest and transplant hair \"follicular units\" in their natural groupings. Thus modern hair transplantation can achieve a natural appearance by mimicking original hair orientation. This hair transplant procedure is called follicular unit transplantation (FUT). Donor hair can be harvested in two different ways: strip harvesting, and follicular unit extraction (FUE).\n\ndoc51693: Hair transplantation. At an initial consultation, the surgeon analyzes the patient's scalp, discusses their preferences and expectations, and advises them on the best approach (e.g. single vs. multiple sessions) and what results might reasonably be expected. Pre-operative folliscopy will help to know the actual existing density of hair, so that postoperative results of newly transplanted hair grafts can be accurately assessed. Some patients may benefit with preoperative topical minoxidil application and vitamins.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51709: Hair transplantation. Advances in wound care allow for semi-permeable dressing, which allow seepage of blood and tissue fluid, to be applied and changed at least daily. The vulnerable recipient area must be shielded from the sun, and shampooing is started two days after the surgery. Some surgeons will have the patient shampoo the day after surgery. Shampooing is important to prevent scabs from forming around the hair shaft. Scabs adhere to the hair shaft and increase the risk of losing newly transplanted hair follicles during the first 7 to 10 days post-op.\n\ndoc865325: Hair follicle. While hair transplantation dates back to the 1950s,[18] and plucked human hair follicle cell culture in vitro to the early 1980s,[19] it was not until 1995 when hair transplantation using individual follicular units was introduced into medical literature.[20]\n\ndoc51696: Hair transplantation. There are several different techniques for harvesting hair follicles, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Regardless of the harvesting technique, proper extraction of the hair follicle is paramount to ensure the viability of the transplanted hair and avoid transection, the cutting of the hair shaft from the hair follicle. Hair follicles grow at a slight angle to the skin's surface, so transplanted tissue must be removed at a corresponding angle.\n\ndoc83001: Pattern hair loss. More advanced cases may be resistant or unresponsive to medical therapy and require hair transplantation. Naturally occurring units of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are excised and moved to areas of hair restoration.[23] These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in close proximity and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained from either follicular unit transplantation (FUT) or follicular unit extraction (FUE). In the former, a strip of skin with follicular units is extracted and dissected into individual follicular unit grafts. The surgeon then implants the grafts into small incisions, called recipient sites.[25][26] Cosmetic scalp tattoos can also mimic the appearance of a short, buzzed haircut.\n\ndoc51717: Hair transplantation. The follicular unit hair transplant procedure has continued to evolve, becoming more refined and minimally invasive as the size of the graft incisions have become smaller. These smaller and less invasive incisions enable surgeons to place a larger number of follicular unit grafts into a given area. With the new \"gold standard\" of ultra refined follicular unit hair transplantation, over 50 grafts can be placed per square centimeter, when appropriate for the patient.[13]\n\ndoc51701: Hair transplantation. With Follicular Unit Extraction or FUE harvesting, individual follicular units containing 1 to 4 hairs are removed under local anesthesia; this micro removal typically uses tiny punches of between 0.6mm and 1.0mm in diameter. The surgeon then uses very small micro blades or fine needles to puncture the sites for receiving the grafts, placing them in a predetermined density and pattern, and angling the wounds in a consistent fashion to promote a realistic hair pattern. The technicians generally do the final part of the procedure, inserting the individual grafts in place.\n\ndoc51700: Hair transplantation. Strip harvesting will leave a thin linear scar in the donor area, which is typically covered by a patient's hair even at relatively short lengths. The recovery period is around 2 weeks and will require the stitches/staples to be removed by medical personnel or sub cuticular suturing can be done.\n\ndoc865324: Hair follicle. Hair follicles form the basis of the two primary methods of hair transplantation in hair restoration, Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and follicular unit extraction (FUE). In each of these methods, naturally occurring groupings of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are extracted from the hair restoration patient and then surgically implanted in the balding area of the patient's scalp, known as the recipient area. These follicles are extracted from donor areas of the scalp, or other parts of the body, which are typically resistant to the miniaturization effects of the hormone DHT. It is this miniaturization of the hair shaft that is the primary predictive indicator of androgenetic alopecia,[17] commonly referred to as male pattern baldness or male hair loss. When these DHT-resistant follicles are transplanted to the recipient area, they continue to grow hair in the normal hair cycle, thus providing the hair restoration patient with permanent, naturally-growing hair. More than 60% of men and 10% of women suffer from hair loss.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51712: Hair transplantation. The use of both scalp flaps, in which a band of tissue with its original blood supply is shifted to the continue bald area, and free grafts dates back to the 19th century. In 1897, Menahem Hodara successfully implanted hair taken from the unaffected areas of the scalp on to the scars that were left bald by favus. Modern transplant techniques began in Japan in the 1930s,[9] where surgeons used small grafts, and even \"follicular unit grafts\" to replace damaged areas of eyebrows or lashes, but not to treat baldness. Their efforts did not receive worldwide attention at the time, and the traumas of World War II kept their advances isolated for another two decades.\n\ndoc51705: Hair transplantation. Follicular unit transplant (FUT) is the traditional hair transplant method which involves extracting a linear strip of hair bearing skin from the back or the side of the scalp. The strip is then dissected to separate individual grafts.\n\ndoc51704: Hair transplantation. Disadvantages include increased surgical times and higher cost to the patient.[4] It is challenging for new surgeons because the procedure is physically demanding and the learning curve to acquire the skills necessary is lengthy and tough.[5] Some surgeons note that FUE can lead to a lower ratio of successfully transplanted follicles as compared to strip harvesting.\n\ndoc51698: Hair transplantation. Strip harvesting is the most common technique for removing hair and follicles from a donor site. The surgeon harvests a strip of skin from the posterior scalp, in an area of good hair growth. A single-, double-, or triple-bladed scalpel is used to remove strips of hair-bearing tissue from the donor site. Each incision is planned so that intact hair follicles are removed. The excised strip is about 1\u20131.5 x 15\u201330\u00a0cm in size. While closing the resulting wound, assistants begin to dissect individual follicular unit grafts, which are small, naturally formed groupings of hair follicles, from the strip. Working with binocular Stereo-microscopes, they carefully remove excess fibrous and fatty tissue while trying to avoid damage to the follicular cells that will be used for grafting. The latest method of closure is called 'Trichophytic closure' which results in much finer scars at the donor area.\n\ndoc51715: Hair transplantation. For the next twenty years, surgeons worked on transplanting smaller grafts, but results were only minimally successful, with 2\u20134\u00a0mm \"plugs\" leading to a doll's head-like appearance. In the 1980s, strip excisions began to replace the plug technique, and Carlos Uebel in Brazil popularized using large numbers of small grafts, while in the United States William Rassman began using thousands of \u201cmicrografts\u201d in a single session.[12]\n\ndoc51716: Hair transplantation. In the late 1980s, B.L. Limmer introduced the use of the stereo-microscope to dissect a single donor strip into small micrografts.\n\ndoc2127331: Moustache. In the Middle East, there is a growing trend for moustache transplants, which involves undergoing a procedure called follicular unit extraction in order to attain fuller, and more impressive facial hair.[12]\n\ndoc51711: Hair transplantation. Hair thinning, known as \"shock loss\", is a common side effect that is usually temporary. Bald patches are also common, as fifty to a hundred hairs can be lost each day. Post-operative hiccups have also been seen in around 5% of transplant patients.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51706: Hair transplantation. Robotic hair restoration devices utilize cameras and robotic arms to assist the surgeon with the FUE procedure. In 2009, NeoGraft became the first robotic surgical device FDA approved for hair restoration.[6] The ARTAS System was FDA approved in 2011 for use in harvesting follicular units from brown-haired and black-haired men.[7] Despite the advantages of robotic hair restoration systems, there are still some disadvantages such as the size of the punches being relatively large in comparison to what is used in other methods of FUE, and the high costs associated with the devices.[8]\n\ndoc51694: Hair transplantation. For several days prior to surgery the patient refrains from using any medicines which might result in intraoperative bleeding and resultant poor grafting. Alcohol and smoking can contribute to poor graft survival. Post operative antibiotics are commonly prescribed to prevent wound or graft infections.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51718: Hair transplantation. Surgeons have also devoted more attention to the angle and orientation of the transplanted grafts. The adoption of the \u201clateral slit\u201d technique in the early 2000s, enabled hair transplant surgeons to orient 2 to 4 hair follicular unit grafts so that they splay out across the scalp's surface. This enabled the transplanted hair to lie better on the scalp and provide better coverage to the bald areas. One disadvantage however, is that lateral incisions also tend to disrupt the scalp's vascularity more than sagittals. Thus sagittal incisions transect less hairs and blood vessels assuming the cutting instruments are of the same size. One of the big advantages of sagittals is that they do a much better job of sliding in and around existing hairs to avoid follicle transection. This certainly makes a strong case for physicians who do not require shaving of the recipient area. The lateral incisions bisect existing hairs perpendicular (horizontal) like a T while sagittal incisions run parallel (vertical) alongside and in between existing hairs. The use of perpendicular (lateral/coronal) slits versus parallel (sagittal) slits, however, has been heavily debated in patient-based hair transplant communities. Many elite hair transplant surgeons typically adopt a combination of both methods based on what is best for the individual patient.\n\ndoc904776: Facial hair in the military. (Details unknown.)\n\ndoc51703: Hair transplantation. FUE can give very natural results. The advantage over strip harvesting is that FUE harvesting negates the need for large areas of scalp tissue to be harvested, so there is no linear incision on the back of the head and it doesn't leave a linear scar. Because individual follicles are removed, only small, punctate scars remain which are virtually not visible and any post-surgical pain and discomfort is minimized. As no suture removal is required, recovery from Micro Grafting FUE is less than 7 days.\n\ndoc1358287: Hair (musical). Rado described the inspiration for Hair as \"a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long\".[2] He recalled, \"There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.\u00c2\u00a0... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.\"[8] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street.[2] Rado said, \"It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage.\"[4]\n\ndoc1798470: Hair. Cut hair may be used in wigs. Global imports of hair in 2010 was worth $US 1.24 billion.[53]\n\ndoc715369: Abdominal hair. Disperse hair growth on the abdomen\n\ndoc518556: Haircut (album). The following personnel are credited on the album:[1]\n\ndoc1746539: Human hair growth. On the scalp, the hair is usually known to be lost around the hair line, leaving the densest amount of hair at the crown. Small vellus hair will often replace the hair that is lost.\n\ndoc1490669: Wig. It takes generally six heads of hair to make a full human hair wig.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51702: Hair transplantation. FUE takes place in a single long session or multiple small sessions. The FUE procedure is more time consuming than strip surgery. An FUE surgery time varies according to the surgeons experience, speed in harvesting and patient characteristics. The procedue can take anywhere from a couple hours to extract 200 grafts for a scar correction to a surgery over two consecutive days for a megasession of 2,500 to 3,000 grafts.[1] With the FUE Hair Transplant procedure there are restrictions on patient candidacy.[2] Clients are selected for FUE based on a fox test,[3] though there is some debate about the usefulness of this in screening clients for FUE.\n\ndoc1358398: Hair (musical). Hair has been performed in most of the countries of the world. After the Berlin Wall fell, the show traveled for the first time to Poland, Lebanon, the Czech Republic and Sarajevo (featured on ABC's Nightline with Ted Koppel, when Phil Alden Robinson visited that city in 1996 and discovered a production of Hair there in the midst of the war).[183] In 1999, Michael Butler and director Bo Crowell helped produce Hair in Russia at the Stas Namin Theatre located in Moscow's Gorky Park. The Moscow production caused a similar reaction as the original did 30\u00c2\u00a0years earlier because Russian soldiers were fighting in Chechnya at the time.[237][238]\n\ndoc2135476: Professional wrestling match types. While most wrestlers (especially female wrestlers) end up growing their hair back out, in some cases the wrestler may tend to keep a shaved head as part of their look. For instance, Angle's kayfabe explanation was that he could not regrow it despite using Rogaine, hair tonic, and even fertilizer. (In reality, he was already going bald naturally, with many jokes about his receding hair line having been made on TV long before his head was shaved; his then-wife Karen had wanted Angle to shave his head. Angle would briefly regrow it for his role in the movie Warrior before shaving it again.[45] Some, such as Molly Holly and CM Punk, wore wigs or masks to hide their head until enough hair has grown back in for them to forego wearing a wig or mask.\n\ndoc1358362: Hair (musical). Excerpts from the title song, \"Hair\"\n\ndoc1746527: Human hair growth. The growth of human hair occurs everywhere on the body except for the soles of the feet, the lips, palms of the hands, some external genital areas, the navel, scar tissue, and, apart from eyelashes, the eyelids.[citation needed] Like skin, hair is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium made of multi-layered flat cells whose rope-like filaments provide structure and strength to the hair shaft.\n\ndoc563628: United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. The recruits are given the opportunity to phone their next of kin and inform them of the recruit's safe arrival, then are searched for contraband. They are issued utility and physical training uniforms and toiletries. From here, the males receive their first military haircut, where they are left essentially bald. Females are instructed in the authorized hairstyling, which allows hair to be short enough to not touch the collar or in a bun.\n\ndoc1358376: Hair (musical). A movie version of Hair, with a screenplay by Michael Weller, was directed by Milo\u0161 Forman and released in 1979. Filmed primarily in New York City's Central Park and Washington Square Park,[170] the cast includes Treat Williams, Beverly D'Angelo, John Savage, Foley and Golden.[171] Several of the songs were deleted, and the film's storyline departs significantly from the musical. The character of Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from Oklahoma, newly arrived in New York to join the military, and Sheila is a high-society debutante who catches his eye. In perhaps the greatest diversion from the stage version, a mistake leads Berger to go to Vietnam in Claude's place, where he is killed.[172]\n\ndoc1358295: Hair (musical). Papp declined to pursue a Broadway production, and so Butler produced the show himself. For a time it seemed that Butler would be unable to secure a Broadway theater, as the Shuberts, Nederlanders and other theater owners deemed the material too controversial. However, Butler had family connections and knew important people; he persuaded Biltmore Theatre owner David Cogan to make his venue available.[26]\n\ndoc1798429: Hair. Hair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucus membranes and glabrous skin, such as that found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips.\n\ndoc713467: Alopecia areata. The objective assessment of treatment efficacy is very difficult and spontaneous remission is unpredictable, but if the affected area is patched, the hair may regrow spontaneously in many cases.[20] None of the existing therapeutic options are curative or preventive.[20]\n\ndoc529595: Janice Rand. He also developed her hair styles for the series, which Roddenberry insisted must be unique and futuristic so that the viewers could believe they were seeing the future on television.[9] She originally appeared with straight hair in promotion photos,[6] but this was changed to a beehive, which was so solid looking that Bob Justman joked that \"You could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent.\"[9] It was created by weaving two Max Factor wigs into a mesh cone.[10] Whitney described the application of the wig, saying \"they nailed it to my head every morning.\"[11] It was created by placing a cone on her head and then weaving the blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that Whitney said she was unrecognizable without it.[12] In the press, she explained that on the show, Rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have made up her hair instantly.[13] The wig was later stolen from the Desilu lot after Whitney was no longer on the series; it was never recovered.[5]\n\ndoc2158599: Khrystyne Haje. Haje was born in Santa Clara, California and has four brothers. Haje is a founding board member of the Earth Communication Office (ECO), which helps to protect ecosystems. She appeared on the March 23, 2012 episode of the Rachael Ray Show to have her hair cut as part of National Donate Your Hair Day (April 27) for women with cancer.[5]\n\ndoc1798426: Hair. Hair growth begins inside the hair follicle. The only \"living\" portion of the hair is found in the follicle. The hair that is visible is the hair shaft, which exhibits no biochemical activity and is considered \"dead\". The base of a hair's root (the \"bulb\") contains the cells that produce the hair shaft.[8] Other structures of the hair follicle include the oil producing sebaceous gland which lubricates the hair and the arrector pili muscles, which are responsible for causing hairs to stand up. In humans with little body hair, the effect results in goose bumps.\n\ndoc2179093: Hair (Hair song). The song was also covered in Australia in 1969 and released as a single by Doug Parkinson in Focus (B-side with \"Without You\") and was a top ten hit for him there that year.[12]\n\ndoc2179090: Hair (Hair song). \"Hair\" is the title song to the 1968 musical Hair and the 1979 film adaptation of the musical.\n\ndoc1358311: Hair (musical). The West Coast version played at the Aquarius Theater in Los Angeles beginning about six months after the Broadway opening and running for an unprecedented two years. The Los Angeles tribe included Rado, Ragni, Robert Rothman, Ben Vereen (who replaced Ragni), Red Shepard, Ted Neeley (who replaced Rado), Meat Loaf, Gloria Jones, T\u00c3\u00a1ta Vega, Jobriath, Jennifer Warnes, and Dobie Gray.[5]\n\ndoc1483156: Hairspray (2007 film). Tory Gardner and his company Alterian, Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on John Travolta. Costume designer Rita Ryack wanted to put Edna into several revealing outfits, so Travolta ended up being encapsulated in prosthetics. He wore silicone prosthetics on his head and neck, and foam latex arms and legs that connected to a spandex and foam body suit.[citation needed]\n\ndoc62451: Laser hair removal. In some countries, including the U.S., hair removal is an unregulated procedure that anyone can do. In some places, only doctors and doctor-supervised personnel can do it, while in other cases permission extends to licensed professionals, such as regular nurses, physician assistants, estheticians, and/or cosmetologists.[21]\n\ndoc82987: Pattern hair loss. Management may include simply accepting the condition.[1] Otherwise, treatments may include minoxidil, finasteride, or hair transplant surgery.[1] Evidence for finasteride in women, however, is poor and it may result in birth defects if taken during pregnancy.[1]\n\ndoc2155695: Tonsure. From Ibnu 'Umar (he says), the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 saw a boy whose head shaven on some parts and let the hair grow on other parts. Then, the Prophet commands, \"Shave the head entirely or let the hair grow entirely\" \nHadith Ahmad II/88, Hadith Abu Dawud no. 4195, and Hadith An-Nasa-i no.5048)[non-primary source needed]\n\ndoc1358372: Hair (musical). An Acapulco, Mexico production of Hair, directed by Castelli,[44] played in 1969 for one\u00c2\u00a0night. After the performance, the theater, located across the street from a popular local bordello, was padlocked by the government, which said the production was \"detrimental to the morals of youth.\"[85] The cast was arrested soon after the performance and taken to Immigration, where they agreed to leave the country, but because of legal complications they were forced to go into hiding.[162] They were expelled from Mexico days later.[163][164]\n\ndoc1358393: Hair (musical). A U.S. National Tour of the production began on October 21, 2010. Principals included Steel Burkhardt as Berger, Paris Remillard as Claude and Caren Lyn Tackett as Sheila.[223] The tour received mostly positive reviews.[219] The show returned to Broadway for an engagement at the St. James Theatre from July 5 through September 10, 2011. After that stop, the tour resumed.[224] The tour ended on January 29, 2012.[225]\n\ndoc713470: Alopecia areata. In most cases which begin with a small number of patches of hair loss, hair grows back after a few months to a year.[7] In cases with a greater number of patches, hair can either grow back or progress to alopecia areata totalis or, in rare cases, alopecia areata universalis.[7]\n\ndoc1490674: Wig. Hair type is the distinguishing factor in human hair wigs. Four main types of hair are used in manufacturing\u00c2\u00a0: Chinese or \"Malaysian\", Indian, Indonesian or \"Brazilian\", and Caucasian or \"European\". The majority of human hair wigs are made of Chinese or Indian hair, while European hair is considered the most expensive and rare, as most donors are from Russia or Northern Europe, where there is a smaller portion of hair donors to the market.\n\ndoc713450: Alopecia areata. There is no cure for the condition.[2] Efforts may be used to try to speed hair regrowth such as cortisone injections.[1][2] Sunscreen, head coverings to protect from cold and sun, and glasses if the eyelashes are missing is recommended.[2] In some cases the hair regrows and the condition does not reoccur.[2] In others hair loss and regrowth occurs over years.[2] Among those in whom all body hair is lost less than 10% recover.[4]\n\ndoc1746540: Human hair growth. Human hair follicles are very sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy administered to the head, most commonly used to treat cancerous growths within the brain.  Hair shedding may start as soon as two weeks after the first dose of radiation and will continue for a couple of weeks.  Hair follicles typically enter the resting telogen phase and regrowth should commence 2.5 to 3 months after the hair begins to shed.  Regrowth may be sparser after treatment.\n\ndoc713476: Alopecia areata. In 2014, preliminary findings showing that oral ruxolitinib, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis, restored hair growth in three individuals with long-standing and severe disease.[26] The medicine costs almost USD $10,000 a month.[27]\n\ndoc1358392: Hair (musical). When the Broadway cast transferred to London for the 2010 West-End revival, a mostly new tribe took over on Broadway on March 9, 2010, including former American Idol finalists Ace Young as Berger and Diana DeGarmo as Sheila. Kyle Riabko assumed the role of Claude, Annaleigh Ashford played Jeanie, and Vanessa Ray was Chrissie. Rachel Bay Jones later played Mother and other roles.[220] Sales decreased after the original cast transferred to London, and the revival closed on June 27, 2010, after 29 previews and 519 regular performances.[221][222]\n\ndoc95641: Human hair color. Natural black hair\n\ndoc1746534: Human hair growth. At some point, the follicle will begin to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will be shed. Within two weeks the new hair shaft will begin to emerge once the telogen phase is complete. The process results in normal hair loss known as shedding.\n\ndoc83000: Pattern hair loss. Minoxidil dilates small blood vessels; it is not clear how this causes hair to grow.[22] Other treatments include tretinoin combined with minoxidil, ketoconazole shampoo, spironolactone,[23] alfatradiol, and topilutamide (fluridil).[24]\n\ndoc1358353: Hair (musical). RCA Victor also released DisinHAIRited (RCA Victor LSO-1163): an album of songs that had been written for the show, but saw varying amounts of stage time. Some of the songs were cut between the Public and Broadway, some had been left off the original cast album due to space, and a few were never performed onstage.[111]\n\ndoc1490666: Wig. Natural hair, either human or from an animal such as a goat or yak, must be carefully sorted so that the direction of growth is maintained, root to root, and point to point. Because of the scale-like structure of the cuticle of a hair shaft, if some hairs get turned the wrong way, they will ride backwards against their neighbors and cause tangles and matting. The highest quality of hair has never been bleached or colored, and has been carefully sorted to ensure the direction is correct. This process is called \"turning\". For less expensive wigs, this labour-intensive sorting process is substituted by \"processing\" the hair. It is treated with a strong base solution which partially dissolves the cuticle leaving the strands smooth. It is then bleached and dyed to the required shade and given a synthetic resin finish which partially restores the strength and luster of the now damaged hair. Synthetic fiber, of course, is simply manufactured in the required colors, and has no direction.\n\ndoc865307: Hair follicle. The hair follicle is a dynamic organ found in mammalian skin.[1] It resides in the dermal layer of the skin and is made up of 20 different cell types, each with distinct functions. The hair follicle regulates hair growth via a complex interaction between hormones, neuropeptides and immune cells.[1] This complex interaction induces the hair follicle to produce different types of hair as seen on different parts of the body. For example, terminal hairs grow on the scalp and lanugo hairs are seen covering the bodies of fetuses in utero and in some new born babies.[1] The process of hair growth occurs in distinct sequential stages. The first stage is called anagen and is the active growth phase, catagen is the resting stage, telogen is the regression of the hair follicle phase, exogen is the active shedding of hair phase and lastly kenogen is the phase between the empty hair follicle and the growth of new hair.[1]\n\ndoc1490664: Wig. Making custom wigs starts with measuring the subject's head. The natural hair is arranged in flat curls against the head as the various measurements are taken. It is often helpful to make a pattern from layers of transparent adhesive tape applied over a piece of plastic wrap, on which the natural hairline can be traced accurately. These measurements are then transferred to the \"block\", a wooden or cork-stuffed canvas form the same size and shape as the client's head.[17][18]\n\ndoc2179092: Hair (Hair song). The song was a major hit for The Cowsills in 1969 and their most successful single. (The Cowsills version cuts out most of the religion-themed lyrics, changing \"long as God can grow it\" to \"long as I can grow it\" and removing some verses.) Their version spent two weeks at #1 on the Cash Box Top 100[9] and reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.[10] It also reached #1 on the RPM Canadian Singles Chart.[11]\n\ndoc1358370: Hair (musical). In April 1971, a\u00a0bomb was thrown at the exterior of a theater in Cleveland, Ohio that had been housing a production, bouncing off the marquee and shattering windows in the building and in nearby storefronts.[156] That same month, the families of cast member Jonathon Johnson and stage manager Rusty Carlson died in a fire in the Cleveland hotel where 33 members of the show's troupe had been staying.[157][158] The Sydney, Australia production's opening night was interrupted by a\u00a0bomb\u00a0scare in June 1969.[159]\n\ndoc1798436: Hair. This is a method which classifies the hair by curl pattern, hair-strand thickness and overall hair volume.\n\ndoc2298644: Labia. Views on pubic hair differ between people and between cultures. Some women prefer the look or feel of pubic hair, while others may choose to remove some or all of it. Temporary methods of removal include shaving, trimming, waxing, sugaring and depilatory products while permanent hair removal can be accomplished using electrolysis or laser hair removal.[11] In Korea, pubic hair is considered a sign of fertility, leading some women to have pubic hair transplants.[6]\n\ndoc1746533: Human hair growth. During the telogen or resting phase (also known as shedding phase) the follicle remains dormant for one to four months. Ten to fifteen percent of the hairs on one's head are in this phase of growth at any given time. In this phase the epidermal cells lining the follicle channel continue to grow as normal and may accumulate around the base of the hair, temporarily anchoring it in place and preserving the hair for its natural purpose without taxing the body's resources needed during the growth phase.\n\ndoc2043159: Ear hair. Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles in the dermis, or skin. With the exception of areas of glabrous skin, the human body is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. It is an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin.\n\ndoc1538650: Long hair. Humans, horses, and orangutans are among the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are believed to have lost their fur 2.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair).[citation needed] The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).\n\ndoc1358385: Hair (musical). James Rado, 2008[145]\n\ndoc2270782: The Five Ks. Comb the hair twice a day, covering it with turban that is to be tied from fresh.\n\ndoc1746536: Human hair growth. Most chemotherapy drugs work by attacking fast-replicating cells. Rapid cell replication is one of the hallmarks of cancer; however, hair follicle cells also grow and divide quickly. Consequently, the chemotherapy drugs usually inhibit hair growth.  The dose and type of medicine determine the severity of hair loss, but once the chemotherapy has ended, new hair growth may begin after three to 10 weeks.\n\ndoc1490671: Wig. The subject's natural hair is again knotted tightly against the head and the wig is applied. Any remaining superfluous wiglace is trimmed away. Hairpins can be used to secure the lace to the hair and occasionally, skin-safe adhesives are used to adhere the wig against bald skin and to better hide any exposed lace. Finishing touches are done to the hair styling to achieve the desired effect.[18]\n\ndoc1358394: Hair (musical). The 2009 Broadway production was duplicated at the Gielgud Theatre in London's West End. Previews began on April 1, 2010, with an official opening on April 14. The producers were the Public Theater, together with Cameron Mackintosh and Broadway Across America. Nearly all of the New York cast relocated to London, but Luther Creek played Woof.[226][227] The London revival closed on September 4, 2010.[228]\n\ndoc1975123: Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy induced hair loss occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can manifest as alopecia totalis, telogen effluvium, or less often alopecia areata.[81] It is usually associated with systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss,[82][83] although permanent cases can occur.[84] Chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men.[85]\n\ndoc700910: Hair cell. The lamina reticularis and subjacent structures.\n\ndoc904782: Facial hair in the military. Soldiers are however by practice allowed to grow beards during service abroad, for example in Afghanistan.\n\ndoc865322: Hair follicle. The telogen phase is the resting phase of the hair follicle.[15] When the body is subjected to extreme stress, as much as 70 percent of hair can prematurely enter the telogen phase and begin to fall, causing a noticeable loss of hair. This condition is called telogen effluvium.[16] The club hair is the final product of a hair follicle in the telogen stage, and is a dead, fully keratinized hair.[8]  Fifty to one-hundred club hair are shed daily from a normal scalp.[8]\n\ndoc713455: Alopecia areata. When healthy hair is pulled out, at most a few should come out, and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp. In cases of alopecia areata, hair will tend to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the body's immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy.[10]\n\ndoc2654323: Bunraku. The preparation of the hair constitutes an art in and of itself. The hair distinguishes the character and can also indicate certain personality traits. The hair is made from human hair, however yak tail can be added to create volume. The ensemble is then fixed on a copper plate. To ensure that the puppet head is not damaged, the finishing of the hairstyle is made with water and bee's wax, not oil.[6]\n\ndoc1358377: Hair (musical). Rado and Ragni were unhappy with the film, feeling that Forman portrayed the hippies as \"oddballs\" and \"some sort of aberration\" without any connection to the peace movement, failing to capture the essence of the original stage production.[173] They stated: \"Any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original Biltmore version, other than some of the songs, the names of the characters, and a common title, eludes us.\"[173] In their view, the screen version of Hair has not yet been produced.[173]\n\ndoc2179094: Hair (Hair song). A version by Dutch rock band Zen reached the top of the Dutch Top 40 in January 1969.[13]\n\ndoc1358291: Hair (musical). Hair premiered off-Broadway at the Public on October 17, 1967, and ran for a limited engagement of six weeks. The lead roles were played by Walker Daniels as Claude, Ragni as Berger, Jill O'Hara as Sheila, Steve Dean as Woof, Arnold Wilkerson as Hud, Sally Eaton as Jeanie and Shelley Plimpton as Crissy.[17] Set design was by Ming Cho Lee, costume design by Theoni Aldredge, and although Anna Sokolow began rehearsals as choreographer, Freedman received choreographer credit.[18] Although the production had a \"tepid critical reception\", it was popular with audiences.[16] A cast album was released in 1967.[19]\n\ndoc1798427: Hair. The root of the hair ends in an enlargement, the hair bulb, which is whiter in color and softer in texture than the shaft, and is lodged in a follicular involution of the epidermis called the hair follicle. Bulb of hair layers consist of fibrous connective tissue, glassy membrane, external root sheath, internal root sheath composed of epithelium stratum (Henle's layer) and granular stratum (Huxley's layer), cuticle, cortex and medulla of hair.[9]\n\ndoc2407745: Hairdresser. In ancient Egypt, hairdressers had specially decorated cases to hold their tools, including lotions, scissors and styling materials. Barbers also worked as hairdressers, and wealthy men often had personal barbers within their home. With the standard of wig wearing within the culture, wigmakers were also trained as hairdressers. In ancient Rome and Greece household slaves and servants took on the role of hairdressers, including dyeing and shaving.  Men who did not have their own private hair or shaving services would visit the local barbershop. Women had their hair maintained and groomed at their homes. Historical documentation is lacking regarding hairstylists from the 5th century until the 14th century. Hair care service grew in demand after a  papal decree in 1092 demanded that all Roman Catholic clergymen remove their facial hair.[1]\n\ndoc1311605: Mohawk people. The traditional hairstyle of the Mohawk, and other tribes of the Iroquois, was to remove the hair from the head by plucking (not shaving) tuft by tuft of hair until all that was left was a square of hair on the back crown of the head. The remaining hair was shortened so that three short braids of hair were created, and those braids were highly decorated. This true \"Mohawk\" hairstyle is not to be confused with the version in popular Western culture, which is actually taken from the Pawnee.\n\ndoc2002185: Barber. In previous times, barbers (known as barber surgeons) also performed surgery and dentistry. With the development of safety razors and the decreasing prevalence of beards, in English-speaking cultures, most barbers now specialize in cutting men's scalp hair as opposed to facial hair.\n\ndoc865321: Hair follicle. The catagen phase is a short transition stage that occurs at the end of the anagen phase.[14] It signals the end of the active growth of a hair. This phase lasts for about 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 weeks while the hair converts to a club hair.\nA club hair is formed during the catagen phase when the part of the hair follicle in contact with the lower portion of the hair becomes attached to the hair shaft. This process cuts the hair off from its blood supply and from the cells that produce new hair. When a club hair is completely formed, about a 2-week process, the hair follicle enters the telogen phase.\n\n"

The surgeon then uses very small micro blades or fine needles to puncture the sites for receiving the grafts, placing them in a predetermined density and pattern, and angling the wounds in a consistent fashion to promote a realistic hair pattern. The technicians generally do the final part of the procedure, inserting the individual grafts in place.\n\ndoc51695: Hair transplantation. Transplant operations are performed on an outpatient basis, with mild sedation (optional) and injected local anesthesia. The scalp is shampooed and then treated with an antibacterial agent prior to the donor scalp being harvested.\n\ndoc51707: Hair transplantation. There are a number of applications for hair transplant surgery, including:\n\ndoc51691: Hair transplantation. Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding, (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp. Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.\n\ndoc51697: Hair transplantation. There are two main ways in which donor grafts are extracted today: strip excision harvesting, and follicular unit extraction.\n\ndoc51714: Hair transplantation. Advancing the theory of donor dominance, Walter P. Unger, M.D. defined the parameters of the \"Safe Donor Zone\" from which the most permanent hair follicles could be extracted for hair transplantation.[11] As transplanted hair will only grow in its new site for as long as it would have in its original one, these parameters continue to serve as the fundamental foundation for hair follicle harvesting, whether by strip method or FUE.\n\ndoc51719: Hair transplantation. Stem cells and dermal papilla cells have been discovered in hair follicles. Research on these follicular cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through hair multiplication (HM), also known as hair cloning.\n\ndoc51713: Hair transplantation. The modern era of hair transplantation in the western world was ushered in the late 1950s, when New York dermatologist Norman Orentreich began to experiment with free donor grafts to balding areas in patients with male pattern baldness. Previously it had been thought that transplanted hair would thrive no more than the original hair at the \"recipient\" site. Orentreich demonstrated that such grafts were \"donor dominant,\" as the new hairs grew and lasted just as they would have at their original home.[10]\n\ndoc51708: Hair transplantation. If donor hair numbers from the back of the head are insufficient, it is possible to perform body hair transplantation (BHT) on appropriate candidates who have available donor hair on the chest, back, shoulders, torso and/or legs. Body hair transplant surgery can only be performed by the FUE harvesting method and, so, requires the skills of an experienced FUE surgeon. However, there are several factors for a potential BHT candidate to consider prior to surgery. These include understanding the natural difference in textural characteristics between body hair and scalp hair, growth rates, and having realistic expectations about the results of BHT surgery.\n\ndoc51710: Hair transplantation. During the first ten days, some of the transplanted hairs, inevitably traumatized by their relocation, may fall out. This is referred to as \"shock loss\". After two to three months new hair will begin to grow from the moved follicles. The patient's hair will grow normally, and continue to thicken through the next six to nine months. Any subsequent hair loss is likely to be only from untreated areas. Some patients elect to use medications to retard such loss, while others plan a subsequent transplant procedure to deal with this eventuality.\n\ndoc51692: Hair transplantation. Since hair naturally grows in groupings of 1 to 4 hairs, current techniques harvest and transplant hair \"follicular units\" in their natural groupings. Thus modern hair transplantation can achieve a natural appearance by mimicking original hair orientation. This hair transplant procedure is called follicular unit transplantation (FUT). Donor hair can be harvested in two different ways: strip harvesting, and follicular unit extraction (FUE).\n\ndoc51693: Hair transplantation. At an initial consultation, the surgeon analyzes the patient's scalp, discusses their preferences and expectations, and advises them on the best approach (e.g. single vs. multiple sessions) and what results might reasonably be expected. Pre-operative folliscopy will help to know the actual existing density of hair, so that postoperative results of newly transplanted hair grafts can be accurately assessed. Some patients may benefit with preoperative topical minoxidil application and vitamins.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51709: Hair transplantation. Advances in wound care allow for semi-permeable dressing, which allow seepage of blood and tissue fluid, to be applied and changed at least daily. The vulnerable recipient area must be shielded from the sun, and shampooing is started two days after the surgery. Some surgeons will have the patient shampoo the day after surgery. Shampooing is important to prevent scabs from forming around the hair shaft. Scabs adhere to the hair shaft and increase the risk of losing newly transplanted hair follicles during the first 7 to 10 days post-op.\n\ndoc865325: Hair follicle. While hair transplantation dates back to the 1950s,[18] and plucked human hair follicle cell culture in vitro to the early 1980s,[19] it was not until 1995 when hair transplantation using individual follicular units was introduced into medical literature.[20]\n\ndoc51696: Hair transplantation. There are several different techniques for harvesting hair follicles, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Regardless of the harvesting technique, proper extraction of the hair follicle is paramount to ensure the viability of the transplanted hair and avoid transection, the cutting of the hair shaft from the hair follicle. Hair follicles grow at a slight angle to the skin's surface, so transplanted tissue must be removed at a corresponding angle.\n\ndoc83001: Pattern hair loss. More advanced cases may be resistant or unresponsive to medical therapy and require hair transplantation. Naturally occurring units of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are excised and moved to areas of hair restoration.[23] These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in close proximity and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained from either follicular unit transplantation (FUT) or follicular unit extraction (FUE). In the former, a strip of skin with follicular units is extracted and dissected into individual follicular unit grafts. The surgeon then implants the grafts into small incisions, called recipient sites.[25][26] Cosmetic scalp tattoos can also mimic the appearance of a short, buzzed haircut.\n\ndoc51717: Hair transplantation. The follicular unit hair transplant procedure has continued to evolve, becoming more refined and minimally invasive as the size of the graft incisions have become smaller. These smaller and less invasive incisions enable surgeons to place a larger number of follicular unit grafts into a given area. With the new \"gold standard\" of ultra refined follicular unit hair transplantation, over 50 grafts can be placed per square centimeter, when appropriate for the patient.[13]\n\ndoc51701: Hair transplantation. With Follicular Unit Extraction or FUE harvesting, individual follicular units containing 1 to 4 hairs are removed under local anesthesia; this micro removal typically uses tiny punches of between 0.6mm and 1.0mm in diameter. The surgeon then uses very small micro blades or fine needles to puncture the sites for receiving the grafts, placing them in a predetermined density and pattern, and angling the wounds in a consistent fashion to promote a realistic hair pattern. The technicians generally do the final part of the procedure, inserting the individual grafts in place.\n\ndoc51700: Hair transplantation. Strip harvesting will leave a thin linear scar in the donor area, which is typically covered by a patient's hair even at relatively short lengths. The recovery period is around 2 weeks and will require the stitches/staples to be removed by medical personnel or sub cuticular suturing can be done.\n\ndoc865324: Hair follicle. Hair follicles form the basis of the two primary methods of hair transplantation in hair restoration, Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and follicular unit extraction (FUE). In each of these methods, naturally occurring groupings of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are extracted from the hair restoration patient and then surgically implanted in the balding area of the patient's scalp, known as the recipient area. These follicles are extracted from donor areas of the scalp, or other parts of the body, which are typically resistant to the miniaturization effects of the hormone DHT. It is this miniaturization of the hair shaft that is the primary predictive indicator of androgenetic alopecia,[17] commonly referred to as male pattern baldness or male hair loss. When these DHT-resistant follicles are transplanted to the recipient area, they continue to grow hair in the normal hair cycle, thus providing the hair restoration patient with permanent, naturally-growing hair. More than 60% of men and 10% of women suffer from hair loss.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51712: Hair transplantation. The use of both scalp flaps, in which a band of tissue with its original blood supply is shifted to the continue bald area, and free grafts dates back to the 19th century. In 1897, Menahem Hodara successfully implanted hair taken from the unaffected areas of the scalp on to the scars that were left bald by favus. Modern transplant techniques began in Japan in the 1930s,[9] where surgeons used small grafts, and even \"follicular unit grafts\" to replace damaged areas of eyebrows or lashes, but not to treat baldness. Their efforts did not receive worldwide attention at the time, and the traumas of World War II kept their advances isolated for another two decades.\n\ndoc51705: Hair transplantation. Follicular unit transplant (FUT) is the traditional hair transplant method which involves extracting a linear strip of hair bearing skin from the back or the side of the scalp. The strip is then dissected to separate individual grafts.\n\ndoc51704: Hair transplantation. Disadvantages include increased surgical times and higher cost to the patient.[4] It is challenging for new surgeons because the procedure is physically demanding and the learning curve to acquire the skills necessary is lengthy and tough.[5] Some surgeons note that FUE can lead to a lower ratio of successfully transplanted follicles as compared to strip harvesting.\n\ndoc51698: Hair transplantation. Strip harvesting is the most common technique for removing hair and follicles from a donor site. The surgeon harvests a strip of skin from the posterior scalp, in an area of good hair growth. A single-, double-, or triple-bladed scalpel is used to remove strips of hair-bearing tissue from the donor site. Each incision is planned so that intact hair follicles are removed. The excised strip is about 1\u20131.5 x 15\u201330\u00a0cm in size. While closing the resulting wound, assistants begin to dissect individual follicular unit grafts, which are small, naturally formed groupings of hair follicles, from the strip. Working with binocular Stereo-microscopes, they carefully remove excess fibrous and fatty tissue while trying to avoid damage to the follicular cells that will be used for grafting. The latest method of closure is called 'Trichophytic closure' which results in much finer scars at the donor area.\n\ndoc51715: Hair transplantation. For the next twenty years, surgeons worked on transplanting smaller grafts, but results were only minimally successful, with 2\u20134\u00a0mm \"plugs\" leading to a doll's head-like appearance. In the 1980s, strip excisions began to replace the plug technique, and Carlos Uebel in Brazil popularized using large numbers of small grafts, while in the United States William Rassman began using thousands of \u201cmicrografts\u201d in a single session.[12]\n\ndoc51716: Hair transplantation. In the late 1980s, B.L. Limmer introduced the use of the stereo-microscope to dissect a single donor strip into small micrografts.\n\ndoc2127331: Moustache. In the Middle East, there is a growing trend for moustache transplants, which involves undergoing a procedure called follicular unit extraction in order to attain fuller, and more impressive facial hair.[12]\n\ndoc51711: Hair transplantation. Hair thinning, known as \"shock loss\", is a common side effect that is usually temporary. Bald patches are also common, as fifty to a hundred hairs can be lost each day. Post-operative hiccups have also been seen in around 5% of transplant patients.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51706: Hair transplantation. Robotic hair restoration devices utilize cameras and robotic arms to assist the surgeon with the FUE procedure. In 2009, NeoGraft became the first robotic surgical device FDA approved for hair restoration.[6] The ARTAS System was FDA approved in 2011 for use in harvesting follicular units from brown-haired and black-haired men.[7] Despite the advantages of robotic hair restoration systems, there are still some disadvantages such as the size of the punches being relatively large in comparison to what is used in other methods of FUE, and the high costs associated with the devices.[8]\n\ndoc51694: Hair transplantation. For several days prior to surgery the patient refrains from using any medicines which might result in intraoperative bleeding and resultant poor grafting. Alcohol and smoking can contribute to poor graft survival. Post operative antibiotics are commonly prescribed to prevent wound or graft infections.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51718: Hair transplantation. Surgeons have also devoted more attention to the angle and orientation of the transplanted grafts. The adoption of the \u201clateral slit\u201d technique in the early 2000s, enabled hair transplant surgeons to orient 2 to 4 hair follicular unit grafts so that they splay out across the scalp's surface. This enabled the transplanted hair to lie better on the scalp and provide better coverage to the bald areas. One disadvantage however, is that lateral incisions also tend to disrupt the scalp's vascularity more than sagittals. Thus sagittal incisions transect less hairs and blood vessels assuming the cutting instruments are of the same size. One of the big advantages of sagittals is that they do a much better job of sliding in and around existing hairs to avoid follicle transection. This certainly makes a strong case for physicians who do not require shaving of the recipient area. The lateral incisions bisect existing hairs perpendicular (horizontal) like a T while sagittal incisions run parallel (vertical) alongside and in between existing hairs. The use of perpendicular (lateral/coronal) slits versus parallel (sagittal) slits, however, has been heavily debated in patient-based hair transplant communities. Many elite hair transplant surgeons typically adopt a combination of both methods based on what is best for the individual patient.\n\ndoc904776: Facial hair in the military. (Details unknown.)\n\ndoc51703: Hair transplantation. FUE can give very natural results. The advantage over strip harvesting is that FUE harvesting negates the need for large areas of scalp tissue to be harvested, so there is no linear incision on the back of the head and it doesn't leave a linear scar. Because individual follicles are removed, only small, punctate scars remain which are virtually not visible and any post-surgical pain and discomfort is minimized. As no suture removal is required, recovery from Micro Grafting FUE is less than 7 days.\n\ndoc1358287: Hair (musical). Rado described the inspiration for Hair as \"a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long\".[2] He recalled, \"There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.\u00c2\u00a0... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.\"[8] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street.[2] Rado said, \"It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage.\"[4]\n\ndoc1798470: Hair.

On the scalp, the hair is usually known to be lost around the hair line, leaving the densest amount of hair at the crown. Small vellus hair will often replace the hair that is lost.\n\ndoc1490669: Wig. It takes generally six heads of hair to make a full human hair wig.[citation needed]\n\ndoc51702: Hair transplantation. FUE takes place in a single long session or multiple small sessions. The FUE procedure is more time consuming than strip surgery. An FUE surgery time varies according to the surgeons experience, speed in harvesting and patient characteristics. The procedue can take anywhere from a couple hours to extract 200 grafts for a scar correction to a surgery over two consecutive days for a megasession of 2,500 to 3,000 grafts.[1] With the FUE Hair Transplant procedure there are restrictions on patient candidacy.[2] Clients are selected for FUE based on a fox test,[3] though there is some debate about the usefulness of this in screening clients for FUE.\n\ndoc1358398: Hair (musical). Hair has been performed in most of the countries of the world. After the Berlin Wall fell, the show traveled for the first time to Poland, Lebanon, the Czech Republic and Sarajevo (featured on ABC's Nightline with Ted Koppel, when Phil Alden Robinson visited that city in 1996 and discovered a production of Hair there in the midst of the war).[183] In 1999, Michael Butler and director Bo Crowell helped produce Hair in Russia at the Stas Namin Theatre located in Moscow's Gorky Park. The Moscow production caused a similar reaction as the original did 30\u00c2\u00a0years earlier because Russian soldiers were fighting in Chechnya at the time.[237][238]\n\ndoc2135476: Professional wrestling match types. While most wrestlers (especially female wrestlers) end up growing their hair back out, in some cases the wrestler may tend to keep a shaved head as part of their look. For instance, Angle's kayfabe explanation was that he could not regrow it despite using Rogaine, hair tonic, and even fertilizer. (In reality, he was already going bald naturally, with many jokes about his receding hair line having been made on TV long before his head was shaved; his then-wife Karen had wanted Angle to shave his head. Angle would briefly regrow it for his role in the movie Warrior before shaving it again.[45] Some, such as Molly Holly and CM Punk, wore wigs or masks to hide their head until enough hair has grown back in for them to forego wearing a wig or mask.\n\ndoc1358362: Hair (musical). Excerpts from the title song, \"Hair\"\n\ndoc1746527: Human hair growth. The growth of human hair occurs everywhere on the body except for the soles of the feet, the lips, palms of the hands, some external genital areas, the navel, scar tissue, and, apart from eyelashes, the eyelids.[citation needed] Like skin, hair is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium made of multi-layered flat cells whose rope-like filaments provide structure and strength to the hair shaft.\n\ndoc563628: United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. The recruits are given the opportunity to phone their next of kin and inform them of the recruit's safe arrival, then are searched for contraband. They are issued utility and physical training uniforms and toiletries. From here, the males receive their first military haircut, where they are left essentially bald. Females are instructed in the authorized hairstyling, which allows hair to be short enough to not touch the collar or in a bun.\n\ndoc1358376: Hair (musical). A movie version of Hair, with a screenplay by Michael Weller, was directed by Milo\u0161 Forman and released in 1979. Filmed primarily in New York City's Central Park and Washington Square Park,[170] the cast includes Treat Williams, Beverly D'Angelo, John Savage, Foley and Golden.[171] Several of the songs were deleted, and the film's storyline departs significantly from the musical. The character of Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from Oklahoma, newly arrived in New York to join the military, and Sheila is a high-society debutante who catches his eye. In perhaps the greatest diversion from the stage version, a mistake leads Berger to go to Vietnam in Claude's place, where he is killed.[172]\n\ndoc1358295: Hair (musical). Papp declined to pursue a Broadway production, and so Butler produced the show himself. For a time it seemed that Butler would be unable to secure a Broadway theater, as the Shuberts, Nederlanders and other theater owners deemed the material too controversial. However, Butler had family connections and knew important people; he persuaded Biltmore Theatre owner David Cogan to make his venue available.[26]\n\ndoc1798429: Hair. Hair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucus membranes and glabrous skin, such as that found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips.\n\ndoc713467: Alopecia areata. The objective assessment of treatment efficacy is very difficult and spontaneous remission is unpredictable, but if the affected area is patched, the hair may regrow spontaneously in many cases.[20] None of the existing therapeutic options are curative or preventive.[20]\n\ndoc529595: Janice Rand. He also developed her hair styles for the series, which Roddenberry insisted must be unique and futuristic so that the viewers could believe they were seeing the future on television.[9] She originally appeared with straight hair in promotion photos,[6] but this was changed to a beehive, which was so solid looking that Bob Justman joked that \"You could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent.\"[9] It was created by weaving two Max Factor wigs into a mesh cone.[10] Whitney described the application of the wig, saying \"they nailed it to my head every morning.\"[11] It was created by placing a cone on her head and then weaving the blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that Whitney said she was unrecognizable without it.[12] In the press, she explained that on the show, Rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have made up her hair instantly.[13] The wig was later stolen from the Desilu lot after Whitney was no longer on the series; it was never recovered.[5]\n\ndoc2158599: Khrystyne Haje. Haje was born in Santa Clara, California and has four brothers. Haje is a founding board member of the Earth Communication Office (ECO), which helps to protect ecosystems. She appeared on the March 23, 2012 episode of the Rachael Ray Show to have her hair cut as part of National Donate Your Hair Day (April 27) for women with cancer.[5]\n\ndoc1798426: Hair. Hair growth begins inside the hair follicle. The only \"living\" portion of the hair is found in the follicle. The hair that is visible is the hair shaft, which exhibits no biochemical activity and is considered \"dead\". The base of a hair's root (the \"bulb\") contains the cells that produce the hair shaft.[8] Other structures of the hair follicle include the oil producing sebaceous gland which lubricates the hair and the arrector pili muscles, which are responsible for causing hairs to stand up. In humans with little body hair, the effect results in goose bumps.\n\ndoc2179093: Hair (Hair song). The song was also covered in Australia in 1969 and released as a single by Doug Parkinson in Focus (B-side with \"Without You\") and was a top ten hit for him there that year.[12]\n\ndoc2179090: Hair (Hair song). \"Hair\" is the title song to the 1968 musical Hair and the 1979 film adaptation of the musical.\n\ndoc1358311: Hair (musical). The West Coast version played at the Aquarius Theater in Los Angeles beginning about six months after the Broadway opening and running for an unprecedented two years. The Los Angeles tribe included Rado, Ragni, Robert Rothman, Ben Vereen (who replaced Ragni), Red Shepard, Ted Neeley (who replaced Rado), Meat Loaf, Gloria Jones, T\u00c3\u00a1ta Vega, Jobriath, Jennifer Warnes, and Dobie Gray.[5]\n\ndoc1483156: Hairspray (2007 film). Tory Gardner and his company Alterian, Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on John Travolta. Costume designer Rita Ryack wanted to put Edna into several revealing outfits, so Travolta ended up being encapsulated in prosthetics. He wore silicone prosthetics on his head and neck, and foam latex arms and legs that connected to a spandex and foam body suit.[citation needed]\n\ndoc62451: Laser hair removal. In some countries, including the U.S., hair removal is an unregulated procedure that anyone can do. In some places, only doctors and doctor-supervised personnel can do it, while in other cases permission extends to licensed professionals, such as regular nurses, physician assistants, estheticians, and/or cosmetologists.[21]\n\ndoc82987: Pattern hair loss. Management may include simply accepting the condition.[1] Otherwise, treatments may include minoxidil, finasteride, or hair transplant surgery.[1] Evidence for finasteride in women, however, is poor and it may result in birth defects if taken during pregnancy.[1]\n\ndoc2155695: Tonsure. From Ibnu 'Umar (he says), the Prophet \u2013 peace be upon him \u2013 saw a boy whose head shaven on some parts and let the hair grow on other parts. Then, the Prophet commands, \"Shave the head entirely or let the hair grow entirely\" \nHadith Ahmad II/88, Hadith Abu Dawud no. 4195, and Hadith An-Nasa-i no.5048)[non-primary source needed]\n\ndoc1358372: Hair (musical). An Acapulco, Mexico production of Hair, directed by Castelli,[44] played in 1969 for one\u00c2\u00a0night. After the performance, the theater, located across the street from a popular local bordello, was padlocked by the government, which said the production was \"detrimental to the morals of youth.\"[85] The cast was arrested soon after the performance and taken to Immigration, where they agreed to leave the country, but because of legal complications they were forced to go into hiding.[162] They were expelled from Mexico days later.[163][164]\n\ndoc1358393: Hair (musical). A U.S. National Tour of the production began on October 21, 2010. Principals included Steel Burkhardt as Berger, Paris Remillard as Claude and Caren Lyn Tackett as Sheila.[223] The tour received mostly positive reviews.[219] The show returned to Broadway for an engagement at the St. James Theatre from July 5 through September 10, 2011. After that stop, the tour resumed.[224] The tour ended on January 29, 2012.[225]\n\ndoc713470: Alopecia areata. In most cases which begin with a small number of patches of hair loss, hair grows back after a few months to a year.[7] In cases with a greater number of patches, hair can either grow back or progress to alopecia areata totalis or, in rare cases, alopecia areata universalis.[7]\n\ndoc1490674: Wig. Hair type is the distinguishing factor in human hair wigs. Four main types of hair are used in manufacturing\u00c2\u00a0: Chinese or \"Malaysian\", Indian, Indonesian or \"Brazilian\", and Caucasian or \"European\". The majority of human hair wigs are made of Chinese or Indian hair, while European hair is considered the most expensive and rare, as most donors are from Russia or Northern Europe, where there is a smaller portion of hair donors to the market.\n\ndoc713450: Alopecia areata. There is no cure for the condition.[2] Efforts may be used to try to speed hair regrowth such as cortisone injections.[1][2] Sunscreen, head coverings to protect from cold and sun, and glasses if the eyelashes are missing is recommended.[2] In some cases the hair regrows and the condition does not reoccur.[2] In others hair loss and regrowth occurs over years.[2] Among those in whom all body hair is lost less than 10% recover.[4]\n\ndoc1746540: Human hair growth. Human hair follicles are very sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy administered to the head, most commonly used to treat cancerous growths within the brain.  Hair shedding may start as soon as two weeks after the first dose of radiation and will continue for a couple of weeks.  Hair follicles typically enter the resting telogen phase and regrowth should commence 2.5 to 3 months after the hair begins to shed.  Regrowth may be sparser after treatment.\n\ndoc713476: Alopecia areata. In 2014, preliminary findings showing that oral ruxolitinib, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis, restored hair growth in three individuals with long-standing and severe disease.[26] The medicine costs almost USD $10,000 a month.[27]\n\ndoc1358392: Hair (musical). When the Broadway cast transferred to London for the 2010 West-End revival, a mostly new tribe took over on Broadway on March 9, 2010, including former American Idol finalists Ace Young as Berger and Diana DeGarmo as Sheila. Kyle Riabko assumed the role of Claude, Annaleigh Ashford played Jeanie, and Vanessa Ray was Chrissie. Rachel Bay Jones later played Mother and other roles.[220] Sales decreased after the original cast transferred to London, and the revival closed on June 27, 2010, after 29 previews and 519 regular performances.[221][222]\n\ndoc95641: Human hair color. Natural black hair\n\ndoc1746534: Human hair growth. At some point, the follicle will begin to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will be shed. Within two weeks the new hair shaft will begin to emerge once the telogen phase is complete. The process results in normal hair loss known as shedding.\n\ndoc83000: Pattern hair loss. Minoxidil dilates small blood vessels; it is not clear how this causes hair to grow.[22] Other treatments include tretinoin combined with minoxidil, ketoconazole shampoo, spironolactone,[23] alfatradiol, and topilutamide (fluridil).[24]\n\ndoc1358353: Hair (musical). RCA Victor also released DisinHAIRited (RCA Victor LSO-1163): an album of songs that had been written for the show, but saw varying amounts of stage time. Some of the songs were cut between the Public and Broadway, some had been left off the original cast album due to space, and a few were never performed onstage.[111]\n\ndoc1490666: Wig. Natural hair, either human or from an animal such as a goat or yak, must be carefully sorted so that the direction of growth is maintained, root to root, and point to point. Because of the scale-like structure of the cuticle of a hair shaft, if some hairs get turned the wrong way, they will ride backwards against their neighbors and cause tangles and matting. The highest quality of hair has never been bleached or colored, and has been carefully sorted to ensure the direction is correct. This process is called \"turning\". For less expensive wigs, this labour-intensive sorting process is substituted by \"processing\" the hair. It is treated with a strong base solution which partially dissolves the cuticle leaving the strands smooth. It is then bleached and dyed to the required shade and given a synthetic resin finish which partially restores the strength and luster of the now damaged hair. Synthetic fiber, of course, is simply manufactured in the required colors, and has no direction.\n\ndoc865307: Hair follicle. The hair follicle is a dynamic organ found in mammalian skin.[1] It resides in the dermal layer of the skin and is made up of 20 different cell types, each with distinct functions. The hair follicle regulates hair growth via a complex interaction between hormones, neuropeptides and immune cells.[1] This complex interaction induces the hair follicle to produce different types of hair as seen on different parts of the body. For example, terminal hairs grow on the scalp and lanugo hairs are seen covering the bodies of fetuses in utero and in some new born babies.[1] The process of hair growth occurs in distinct sequential stages. The first stage is called anagen and is the active growth phase, catagen is the resting stage, telogen is the regression of the hair follicle phase, exogen is the active shedding of hair phase and lastly kenogen is the phase between the empty hair follicle and the growth of new hair.[1]\n\ndoc1490664: Wig. Making custom wigs starts with measuring the subject's head. The natural hair is arranged in flat curls against the head as the various measurements are taken. It is often helpful to make a pattern from layers of transparent adhesive tape applied over a piece of plastic wrap, on which the natural hairline can be traced accurately. These measurements are then transferred to the \"block\", a wooden or cork-stuffed canvas form the same size and shape as the client's head.[17][18]\n\ndoc2179092: Hair (Hair song). The song was a major hit for The Cowsills in 1969 and their most successful single. (The Cowsills version cuts out most of the religion-themed lyrics, changing \"long as God can grow it\" to \"long as I can grow it\" and removing some verses.) Their version spent two weeks at #1 on the Cash Box Top 100[9] and reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.[10] It also reached #1 on the RPM Canadian Singles Chart.[11]\n\ndoc1358370: Hair (musical). In April 1971, a\u00a0bomb was thrown at the exterior of a theater in Cleveland, Ohio that had been housing a production, bouncing off the marquee and shattering windows in the building and in nearby storefronts.[156] That same month, the families of cast member Jonathon Johnson and stage manager Rusty Carlson died in a fire in the Cleveland hotel where 33 members of the show's troupe had been staying.[157][158] The Sydney, Australia production's opening night was interrupted by a\u00a0bomb\u00a0scare in June 1969.[159]\n\ndoc1798436: Hair. This is a method which classifies the hair by curl pattern, hair-strand thickness and overall hair volume.\n\ndoc2298644: Labia. Views on pubic hair differ between people and between cultures. Some women prefer the look or feel of pubic hair, while others may choose to remove some or all of it. Temporary methods of removal include shaving, trimming, waxing, sugaring and depilatory products while permanent hair removal can be accomplished using electrolysis or laser hair removal.[11] In Korea, pubic hair is considered a sign of fertility, leading some women to have pubic hair transplants.[6]\n\ndoc1746533: Human hair growth. During the telogen or resting phase (also known as shedding phase) the follicle remains dormant for one to four months. Ten to fifteen percent of the hairs on one's head are in this phase of growth at any given time. In this phase the epidermal cells lining the follicle channel continue to grow as normal and may accumulate around the base of the hair, temporarily anchoring it in place and preserving the hair for its natural purpose without taxing the body's resources needed during the growth phase.\n\ndoc2043159: Ear hair. Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles in the dermis, or skin. With the exception of areas of glabrous skin, the human body is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. It is an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin.\n\ndoc1538650: Long hair. Humans, horses, and orangutans are among the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are believed to have lost their fur 2.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair).[citation needed] The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).\n\ndoc1358385: Hair (musical). James Rado, 2008[145]\n\ndoc2270782: The Five Ks. Comb the hair twice a day, covering it with turban that is to be tied from fresh.\n\ndoc1746536: Human hair growth. Most chemotherapy drugs work by attacking fast-replicating cells. Rapid cell replication is one of the hallmarks of cancer; however, hair follicle cells also grow and divide quickly. Consequently, the chemotherapy drugs usually inhibit hair growth.  The dose and type of medicine determine the severity of hair loss, but once the chemotherapy has ended, new hair growth may begin after three to 10 weeks.\n\ndoc1490671: Wig. The subject's natural hair is again knotted tightly against the head and the wig is applied. Any remaining superfluous wiglace is trimmed away. Hairpins can be used to secure the lace to the hair and occasionally, skin-safe adhesives are used to adhere the wig against bald skin and to better hide any exposed lace. Finishing touches are done to the hair styling to achieve the desired effect.[18]\n\ndoc1358394: Hair (musical). The 2009 Broadway production was duplicated at the Gielgud Theatre in London's West End. Previews began on April 1, 2010, with an official opening on April 14. The producers were the Public Theater, together with Cameron Mackintosh and Broadway Across America. Nearly all of the New York cast relocated to London, but Luther Creek played Woof.[226][227] The London revival closed on September 4, 2010.[228]\n\ndoc1975123: Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy induced hair loss occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can manifest as alopecia totalis, telogen effluvium, or less often alopecia areata.[81] It is usually associated with systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss,[82][83] although permanent cases can occur.[84] Chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men.[85]\n\ndoc700910: Hair cell. The lamina reticularis and subjacent structures.\n\ndoc904782: Facial hair in the military. Soldiers are however by practice allowed to grow beards during service abroad, for example in Afghanistan.\n\ndoc865322: Hair follicle. The telogen phase is the resting phase of the hair follicle.[15] When the body is subjected to extreme stress, as much as 70 percent of hair can prematurely enter the telogen phase and begin to fall, causing a noticeable loss of hair. This condition is called telogen effluvium.[16] The club hair is the final product of a hair follicle in the telogen stage, and is a dead, fully keratinized hair.[8]  Fifty to one-hundred club hair are shed daily from a normal scalp.[8]\n\ndoc713455: Alopecia areata. When healthy hair is pulled out, at most a few should come out, and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp. In cases of alopecia areata, hair will tend to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the body's immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy.[10]\n\ndoc2654323: Bunraku. The preparation of the hair constitutes an art in and of itself. The hair distinguishes the character and can also indicate certain personality traits. The hair is made from human hair, however yak tail can be added to create volume. The ensemble is then fixed on a copper plate. To ensure that the puppet head is not damaged, the finishing of the hairstyle is made with water and bee's wax, not oil.[6]\n\ndoc1358377: Hair (musical). Rado and Ragni were unhappy with the film, feeling that Forman portrayed the hippies as \"oddballs\" and \"some sort of aberration\" without any connection to the peace movement, failing to capture the essence of the original stage production.[173] They stated: \"Any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original Biltmore version, other than some of the songs, the names of the characters, and a common title, eludes us.\"[173] In their view, the screen version of Hair has not yet been produced.[173]\n\ndoc2179094: Hair (Hair song). A version by Dutch rock band Zen reached the top of the Dutch Top 40 in January 1969.[13]\n\ndoc1358291: Hair (musical). Hair premiered off-Broadway at the Public on October 17, 1967, and ran for a limited engagement of six weeks. The lead roles were played by Walker Daniels as Claude, Ragni as Berger, Jill O'Hara as Sheila, Steve Dean as Woof, Arnold Wilkerson as Hud, Sally Eaton as Jeanie and Shelley Plimpton as Crissy.[17] Set design was by Ming Cho Lee, costume design by Theoni Aldredge, and although Anna Sokolow began rehearsals as choreographer, Freedman received choreographer credit.[18] Although the production had a \"tepid critical reception\", it was popular with audiences.[16] A cast album was released in 1967.[19]\n\ndoc1798427: Hair. The root of the hair ends in an enlargement, the hair bulb, which is whiter in color and softer in texture than the shaft, and is lodged in a follicular involution of the epidermis called the hair follicle. Bulb of hair layers consist of fibrous connective tissue, glassy membrane, external root sheath, internal root sheath composed of epithelium stratum (Henle's layer) and granular stratum (Huxley's layer), cuticle, cortex and medulla of hair.[9]\n\ndoc2407745: Hairdresser. In ancient Egypt, hairdressers had specially decorated cases to hold their tools, including lotions, scissors and styling materials. Barbers also worked as hairdressers, and wealthy men often had personal barbers within their home. With the standard of wig wearing within the culture, wigmakers were also trained as hairdressers. In ancient Rome and Greece household slaves and servants took on the role of hairdressers, including dyeing and shaving.  Men who did not have their own private hair or shaving services would visit the local barbershop. Women had their hair maintained and groomed at their homes. Historical documentation is lacking regarding hairstylists from the 5th century until the 14th century. Hair care service grew in demand after a  papal decree in 1092 demanded that all Roman Catholic clergymen remove their facial hair.[1]\n\ndoc1311605: Mohawk people. The traditional hairstyle of the Mohawk, and other tribes of the Iroquois, was to remove the hair from the head by plucking (not shaving) tuft by tuft of hair until all that was left was a square of hair on the back crown of the head. The remaining hair was shortened so that three short braids of hair were created, and those braids were highly decorated. This true \"Mohawk\" hairstyle is not to be confused with the version in popular Western culture, which is actually taken from the Pawnee.\n\ndoc2002185: Barber. In previous times, barbers (known as barber surgeons) also performed surgery and dentistry. With the development of safety razors and the decreasing prevalence of beards, in English-speaking cultures, most barbers now specialize in cutting men's scalp hair as opposed to facial hair.\n\ndoc865321: Hair follicle. The catagen phase is a short transition stage that occurs at the end of the anagen phase.[14] It signals the end of the active growth of a hair. This phase lasts for about 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 weeks while the hair converts to a club hair.\nA club hair is formed during the catagen phase when the part of the hair follicle in contact with the lower portion of the hair becomes attached to the hair shaft. This process cuts the hair off from its blood supply and from the cells that produce new hair. When a club hair is completely formed, about a 2-week process, the hair follicle enters the telogen phase.\n\n"
