Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: when did the granite mountain hotshots get certified\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc110851: Prescott Fire Department. The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a hotshot crew in 2008.[5] The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment, including two 10-person crew carriers, was housed.[6] The 2017 film Only the Brave was based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Fire.\n\ndoc1957917: Yarnell Hill Fire. The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough.[19] He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC Captain.[15] Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew entrapment.[5][20] After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew.[5]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery. The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite. A-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic \"hot spot\" activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry. These granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.[10][11]\n\ndoc102124: Hot Coffee mod. On June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled. They are required to \"clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority.\" Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in civil penalties.[22]\n\ndoc3414: Big Sur. By this time Granite Rock's permit had expired. In 2010, the company's president stated that he believed that at some point the company would be allowed to extract the limestone in a way that doesn't harm the environment.[163][164] As of 2017[update], they still own the land, which is zoned WSC/40-D(CZ) for Watershed and Scenic Conservation.[97]\n\ndoc102119: Hot Coffee mod. On August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory recall for all games still owned by the general public.[citation needed] Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the \"uncensored\" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily. However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have grandfathered these copies of the game to their collection.[citation needed]\n\ndoc3412: Big Sur. Mount Pico Blanco is topped by a distinctive white limestone cap, visible from California's Highway One.[160] The Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California has since 1963 owned the mineral rights to 2,800 acres (1,100\u00a0ha), or all of section 36, which sits astride and surrounds the summit of Pico Blanco Mountain. Limestone is a key ingredient in concrete and Pico Blanco contains a particularly high grade deposit, reportedly the largest in California,[161] and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains.[162] In 1980 Granite Rock applied for a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to begin excavating a 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary.[97]\n\ndoc2438387: Hot 'n Now. In October 2003, Proquest Capital Corporation acquired Hot 'n Now assets and some liabilities from Hot 'n Now, LLC. Proquest was soon renamed to Hot Brands, Inc. At the time of acquisition, the chain had 44 locations, 23 corporate and 21 franchisee owned, in three states: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana.[10]\n\ndoc1027307: James Hutton. In 1785 at Glen Tilt in the Cairngorm mountains in the Scottish Highlands, Hutton found granite penetrating metamorphic schists, in a way which indicated that the granite had been molten at the time. This demonstrated to him that granite formed from the cooling of molten rock rather than it precipitating out of water as others at the time believed, and therefore the granite must be younger than the schists.[22][23]\n\ndoc999396: Mount Shasta. The last to form, and the highest cone, the Hotlum Cone, formed about 8,000 years ago. It is named after the Hotlum glacier on its northern face; its longest lava flow, the 500-foot-thick (150-metre) Military Pass flow, extends 5.5\u00a0mi (8.9\u00a0km) down its northeast face. Since the creation of the Hotlum Cone, a dacite dome intruded the cone and now forms the summit. The rock at the 600-foot-wide (180-metre) summit crater has been extensively hydrothermally altered by sulfurous hot springs and fumaroles there (only a few examples still remain).[citation needed]\n\ndoc1957916: Yarnell Hill Fire. On June 30, 19 firefighters with the Prescott Fire Department's interagency Granite Mountain Hotshots were overrun and killed by the fire.[15] Initial reports indicated that one of the firefighters was not a member of the hotshot crew, but Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo later confirmed that all 19 were from the Granite Mountain Hotshots.[16] The firefighters had apparently deployed fire shelters, but not all of the bodies were found inside them.[17] The city of Prescott released the names of the 19 firefighters on July 1.[18]\n\ndoc1451236: Table Mountain. Hiking on Table Mountain is popular amongst locals and tourists, and a number of trails of varying difficulty are available. Because of the steep cliffs around the summit, direct ascents from the city side are limited. Platteklip Gorge, a prominent gorge up the centre of the main table, is a popular and straightforward direct ascent to the summit. Par for the course is about 2.5 hours but is done between 1\u20133 hours depending on one's fitness level. This route is very hot in summer, as it is located on the north facing slope of the mountain, with almost no shade along the 600\u00a0m climb from Tafelberg Road to the Table Mountain plateau.\n\ndoc744403: Trucking industry in the United States. The Hotshot vehicle or truck is essentially a pick-up with a larger load capacity than a personal truck. Hotshots are typically single axle 1-ton to 3-ton trucks, which can be either a dual or single tire.\n\ndoc378524: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The race is self sanctioned and has taken place since 1916.[1][2] It is currently contested by a variety of classes of cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads. There are often numerous new classes tried and discarded year-to-year. On average there are 130 competitors. The PPIHC operates as the Pikes Peak Auto Hill Climb Educational Museum to organize the annual motorsports event.[1]\n\ndoc1157931: Granite. Granite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers, for its steepness, soundness, crack systems, and friction. Well-known venues for granite climbing include Yosemite, the Bugaboos, the Mont Blanc massif (and peaks such as the Aiguille du Dru, the Mountains of Mourne, the Adamello-Presanella Alps, the Aiguille du Midi and the Grandes Jorasses), the Bregaglia, Corsica, parts of the Karakoram (especially the Trango Towers), the Fitzroy Massif, Patagonia, Baffin Island, Ogawayama, the Cornish coast, the Cairngorms, Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the Stawamus Chief, British Columbia, Canada.\n\ndoc3413: Big Sur. After the Forest Service granted the permit, the California Coastal Commission required Graniterock to apply for a coastal development permit in accordance with the requirements of the California Coastal Act. Granite Rock filed suit, claiming that the Coastal Commission permit requirement was preempted by the Forest Service review. When Granite Rock prevailed in the lower courts, the Coastal Commission appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which in a historic 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 decision in 1987, found in favor of the commission.[163]\n\ndoc862779: Rocky Mountain National Park. Gem Lake is high among the rounded granite domes of Lumpy Ridge. Untouched by glaciation, this outcrop of 1.8 billion-year-old granite has been sculpted by wind and chemical erosion into a backbone-like ridge. Pillars, potholes, and balanced rocks are found around the midpoint of the trail, along with views of the Estes Valley and Continental Divide.[74] Potts Puddle trail is accessible from the Black Canyon trail.[74]\n\ndoc1249329: Here Comes the Hotstepper. *sales figures based on certification alone\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\n\ndoc378544: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.

The Granite Gripper is an annual rock climbing competition that acts as a fund raiser for park conservation through the Friends of Enchanted Rock.[23]\n\ndoc102115: Hot Coffee mod. On August 10, 2005, Rockstar Games officially released a patch for San Andreas.[17] The patch fixed many performance issues and bugs. However, the patch also disabled the controversial \"Hot Coffee\" scenes, even if the \"Hot Coffee\" mod was re-installed.\n\ndoc1157917: Granite. A study of granite countertops was done (initiated and paid for by the Marble Institute of America) in November 2008 by National Health and Engineering Inc. of USA. In this test, all of the 39 full-size granite slabs that were measured for the study showed radiation levels well below the European Union safety standards (section 4.1.1.1 of the National Health and Engineering study) and radon emission levels well below the average outdoor radon concentrations in the US.[22]\n\ndoc752321: Table Mountain Aerial Cableway. In 1993, the son of one of the founders sold the TMACC and the new owners took charge of upgrading the cableway. In 1997, the cableway was reopened after extensive renovations, and new cars were introduced.\n\ndoc999397: Mount Shasta. In the last 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted at least eight or nine times. About 200 years ago the last significant Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a hot lahar (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed 7.5\u00a0mi (12.1\u00a0km) down Mount Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek. A separate hot lahar went 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) down Mud Creek. This eruption was thought to have been observed by the explorer La P\u00e9rouse, from his ship off the California coast, in 1786, but this has been disputed.[29]\n\ndoc1093936: Stone Mountain. The granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont region during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny, which was the time when North America and North Africa collided.  Over time, erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock.  This intrusion of granite also gave rise to Panola Mountain and Arabia Mountain, both in DeKalb County, smaller outcroppings farther south of Stone Mountain.\n\ndoc102114: Hot Coffee mod. On July 29, 2005, as a result of the newly discovered scenes, the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) revoked the game's \"MA15+\" classification (the highest rating then available for computer games in Australia) and changed the game's rating to Refused Classification (RC), which officially banned the original version from being sold in the country. The patched version was given an \"MA15+\" classification on September 12, 2005.[16]\n\ndoc1157899: Granite. The letter-based Chappell & White classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into I-type granite (or igneous protolith) granite and S-type or sedimentary protolith granite.[9] Both of these types of granite are formed by the melting of high grade metamorphic rocks, either other granite or intrusive mafic rocks, or buried sediment, respectively.\n\ndoc1902113: Shooter (2007 film). The mountain top confrontation was shot on Rainbow Glacier, near the resort town of Whistler, British Columbia.[7]\n\ndoc2205301: History of Arizona. On June 30, 2013, nineteen members of the Prescott Fire Department were killed fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire.[47] The fatalities were members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a hotshot crew,[48] of whom only one survived as they were working in another location.[48]\n\ndoc1035514: Granite Falls, Minnesota. Granite Falls, along with the rest of Minnesota, has a humid continental climate[11] with significant differences between seasons. With a July mean temperature of 22.2\u00a0\u00b0C (72.0\u00a0\u00b0F) Granite Falls just falls into the hot-summer zone of the K\u00f6ppen classification of the humid continental climate regime.[12] Winters are cold and dry influenced by arctic air masses affecting it through its continental position, while summers are influenced by humid subtropical air masses bringing hot temperatures and significant rainfall. Transitional periods are very short, since only April and October are between 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) and 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) in daily mean temperatures, with May\u2013September being clearly above and November\u2013March averaging below freezing.[12] The middle three months in each of those cycles are also clearly warmer and colder, respectively, than the months at the beginning or at the end of transitional periods. That is in turn a typical feature of continental climates.\n\ndoc1157916: Granite. There is some concern that some granite sold as countertops or building material may be hazardous to health. Dan Steck of St. Johns University has stated[21] that approximately 5% of all granite is of concern, with the caveat that only a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands of granite slab types have been tested. Various resources from national geological survey organizations are accessible online to assist in assessing the risk factors in granite country and design rules relating, in particular, to preventing accumulation of radon gas in enclosed basements and dwellings.\n\ndoc1267420: Aoraki / Mount Cook. The first recorded attempt on the summit was made by the Irishman Rev. William S. Green and the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss and the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kaufmann on 2 March 1882 via the Tasman and Linda Glaciers.[27] Mt Cook Guidebook author Hugh Logan believe they came within 50\u00c2\u00a0metres of the summit.[28]\n\ndoc1035509: Granite Falls, Minnesota. Granite Falls was platted in 1872.[8] The city was named for deposits of granite rock in the area.[9] A post office has been in operation at Granite Falls since 1870.[10] Granite Falls was incorporated as a city in 1889.[8]\n\ndoc2006709: Pike's Peak Gold Rush. In 1849 and 1850, several parties of gold seekers bound for the California Gold Rush panned small amounts of gold from various streams in the South Platte River valley at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountain gold failed to impress or delay men with visions of unlimited wealth in California, and the discoveries were not reported for several years.[4]\n\ndoc217707: Hard Rock Cafe. In 1990, The Rank Group, a London-based leisure company, acquired Mecca Leisure Group and continued expansion of the concept in its geographic territory. Rank went on to purchase Hard Rock America from Peter Morton as well as Hard Rock Canada from Nick Bitove. After the completion of these acquisitions, Rank gained worldwide control of the brand. In March 2007, the Seminole Tribe of Florida acquired Hard Rock Cafe International, Inc. and other related entities from Rank for US$965 million.[1] In 2008, anonymous members of the wait staff criticized the business because of its practice of paying them less than half the official minimum wage in the UK, with the business allocating tips to staff to bring their salaries within the law. Most customers, it was argued, do not realize that they are subsidizing a low wage when they give the tip.[6]\n\ndoc1957922: Yarnell Hill Fire. A Memorial State Park was created to honor the hotshots. A 2.85 mile path leads from a parking area on Highway 89 up to an observation deck. A trail follows the last steps of the Hotshots down to the fatality site where they made their last stand. Encircling the fatality site, 19 gabions, one for each Hotshot, are united by chains.[31]\n\ndoc1551079: Hotspot (geology). The origins of the concept of hotspots lie in the work of J. Tuzo Wilson, who postulated in 1963 that the formation of the Hawaiian Islands resulted from the slow movement of a tectonic plate across a hot region beneath the surface.[4] It was later postulated that hotspots are fed by narrow streams of hot mantle rising from the Earth's core\u2013mantle boundary in a structure called a mantle plume.[5] Whether or not such mantle plumes exist is the subject of a major controversy in Earth science.[3][6] Estimates for the number of hotspots postulated to be fed by mantle plumes has ranged from about 20 to several thousands, over the years, with most geologists considering a few tens to exist. Hawaii, R\u00e9union, Yellowstone, Gal\u00e1pagos, and Iceland are some of the most active volcanic regions to which the hypothesis is applied.\n\ndoc1954063: Allegheny Mountains. The Homestead, Hot Springs, Virginia has catered to spa enthusiasts since 1766.\n\ndoc2560918: Mount Mazama. Pyroclastic cones at Mazama include Wizard Island, Bald Crater, Maklaks Crater (also known as Diller Cone) and Forgotten Cone. In addition to its crater, referred to as Williams Crater or the Forgotten Crater, Mazama's various volcanic vents occur at Cleetwood, Llao Rock, and Redcloud, which are located at elevations of 7,005 feet (2,135\u00a0m), 8,045 feet (2,452\u00a0m), and 7,949 feet (2,423\u00a0m), respectively. Nearby cinder cones include Bear Butte, Crater Peak, Desert Cone, Lookout Butte, Pothole Butte, Red Cone, Scout Hill, and Union Peak.[1] There are at least 13 cinder cones within Crater Lake National Park, and at least eleven more in the nearby area. They were fed by a different magma chamber than Mazama, though they likely received magma from basaltic andesite reservoirs in the vicinity. The exception is Williams crater, which erupted basalt and dacite and got silicic lava from the western part of Mazama's magma chamber.[66] Stratovolcanoes in Mazama's vicinity consist of Sentinel Rock, Mount Scott, Phantom Cone, Dutton Cliff, and Danger Bay.[1]\n\ndoc1678722: Hot tub. In 2001[25] and in 2012[26] the CPSC issued recalls for spa heaters which overheated and caused fires.\n\ndoc1451213: Table Mountain. The basement rocks are not nearly as resistant to weathering as the TMS, but significant outcrops of the Cape Granite are visible on the western side of Lion's Head, and elsewhere on the Peninsula (especially below Chapman's Peak Drive, and The Boulders near Simon's Town).[6][9][10] The weathered granite soil of the lower slopes of the Peninsula Mountain range are more fertile than the nutrient-poor soils derived from TMS. Most of the vineyards found on the Cape Peninsula are therefore found on these granitic slopes of the Table Mountain range.\n\ndoc378552: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.

One means of fundraising that Harvest Campaign administrators decided on was to counterstamp some of the coins for sale at premium prices. The letters and numbers are believed to have been punched by the Association, as they are almost entirely uniform. Some were given a state abbreviation and a number, and were sent to be auctioned in various towns. Gibbes reported that the counterstamped pieces sent to South Carolina sold for an average of $23, ranging from $10 to $110, and recommended that the auctions be preceded with the account of the sale of one in Bradenton, Florida, for $1,300.[55] Which town got which number was the luck of the draw.[56] Others were marked with \"U.D.C.\" and a state abbreviation, together with a number which probably represents a membership or chapter number. These were intended for presentation to members deserving of special honor, such as an outgoing president. They did not sell well, as the Association had alienated many UDC members over the firing of Borglum. The Association also announced a program for sale to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, although whether any coins were sold under this program is unclear, as none have been identified.[57] Pieces marked \"G.L.\" and \"S.L.\" were puzzled over by collectors for many years; A. Steve Deitert in the January 2011 edition of The Numismatist identified the markings as \"Gold Lavalier\" and \"Silver Lavalier\". These coins were given to county winners and runners-up in a selling competition for young women.[58]\n\ndoc1548383: Vermont. The towns of Rutland and Barre are the traditional centers of marble and granite quarrying and carving in the U.S. For many years Vermont was also the headquarters of the smallest union in the U.S., the Stonecutters Association, of about 500 members. The first marble quarry in America was on Mount Aeolus overlooking East Dorset.[191] The granite industry attracted numerous skilled stonecutters in the late 19th century from Italy, Scotland, and Ireland. Barre is the location of the Rock of Ages quarry, the largest dimension stone granite quarry in the United States. Vermont is the largest producer of slate in the country. The highest quarrying revenues result from the production of dimension stone.[citation needed] The Rock of Ages quarry in Barre is one of the leading exporters of granite in the country. The work of the sculptors of this corporation can be seen 3 miles (4.8\u00c2\u00a0km) down the road at the Hope Cemetery, where there are gravestones and mausoleums.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2015205: List of hot springs.

Granite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the Georgia Railroad in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, the steps to the East Wing of the United States Capitol and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Foundation to be considered for use in a planned monument in King's honor; the foundation later chose to use granite imported from China.[36] Quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.\n\ndoc520666: Recording Industry Association of America certification. The best-selling video box set as certified by the RIAA is The Rolling Stones' Four Flicks DVD compilation from their Licks World Tour, with a 19X Multi-Platinum designation.

Marble Falls was founded in 1887 by Adam Rankin Johnson, a former Indian fighter and Confederate general, known as \"Stovepipe\" Johnson for his Civil War escapades, which included duping the Union army in Newburgh, Indiana, with fake \"cannons,\" constructed from stovepipes and wagon wheels. Johnson had viewed the natural Marble Falls during his pre-war days as a Burnet County surveyor, and had dreamed of building an industrial city, powered by the tumbling Colorado River, not to be confused with the river of the same name in Colorado and Arizona. Despite a \"friendly fire\" incident which blinded him near the end of the Civil War, General Johnson followed through with his dream, facilitating the construction of a railroad to nearby Granite Mountain in 1884, then (with ten partners, including one son, one nephew and two sons-in-law) platting the townsite and selling lots, beginning July 12, 1887. Johnson built a fine home, a college (soon to be home of the \"Falls on the Colorado Museum\") and a large factory near the falls. The town grew to a population of 1,800 within ten years.\n\ndoc2015206: List of hot springs. Goudini Spa, Worcester area, Western Cape\n\ndoc643577: Action Park. In 2010, the whole Mountain Creek ski area and water park was sold[8] to a group led by Eugene Mulvihill, the former owner of Great American Recreation and the owner of the adjacent Crystal Springs Resort. It was under the new ownership that the name of the water park was changed back to Action Park, with the park assuming that name when it opened for the 2014 season.[9] In 2016, the Mountain Creek Park name was restored to the park, thus retiring the Action Park name again.\n\ndoc344413: List of cannon projectiles.

The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (PPIHC), also known as The Race to the Clouds, is an annual invitational automobile and motorcycle hill climb to the summit of Pikes Peak, every year on the last Sunday of June. The first running of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb was promoted by Spencer Penrose. Penrose had finished widening the narrow carriage road into a much wider \"Pikes Peak Highway.\" He decided to encourage tourists to visit by creating a race to the clouds.\n\ndoc2485369: Chicxulub crater. It was announced in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, had been found in drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked rocks deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite.[72]\n\ndoc1295703: Curling. Trefor granite comes from the Yr Eifl or Trefor Granite Quarry in the village of Trefor on the north coast of the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in Gwynedd, Wales and has produced granite since 1850. Trefor granite comes in shades of pink, blue and grey.[39] The quarry supplies curling stone granite exclusively to the Canadian, Canada Curling Stone Co., which has been producing stones since 1992 and supplied the stones for the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\ndoc1019563: Beastie Boys. In what can only be described as a bizarre coincidence, following an exhaustive re-sequence marathon, Beastie Boys have verified that their new Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 will be composed of the same 16 tracks originally slated for inclusion on Hot Sauce Committee Part 1. The record (part 2 that is) will be released as planned in spring 2011 on Capitol. The tracks originally recorded for Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 (which now are actually back on Part 1) have now apparently been bumped to make room for the former Hot Sauce Committee Part 1 material.

By this time the various members were thoroughly engaged with their various solo projects. Following the release of Kantner and Slick's Sunfighter in November 1971 and Creach's eponymous solo debut in December 1971, Hot Tuna released their first studio album and third opus (Burgers) in February 1972; meanwhile, Joey Covington immersed himself in various Grunt Records projects, including his own solo album (Fat Fandango, released in 1973) and the sessions for Black Kangaroo's debut album (led by Peter Kaukonen, Jorma's younger brother). However, Covington was either dismissed from the band or left of his own volition shortly after the sessions commenced.\n\ndoc428601: Pikes Peak. Pikes Peak is composed of a characteristic pink granite called Pikes Peak granite. The color is due to a large amount of potassium feldspar. It is thought that the granite was once magma that crystallized at least 20 miles (32\u00c2\u00a0km) beneath the Earth's surface, formed by an igneous intrusion during the Precambrian, approximately 1.05 billion years ago, during the Grenville orogeny. Through the process of uplifting, the hardened rock pushed through the Earth's crust and created a dome-like mountain, covered with less resistant rock. Years of erosion and weathering removed the soil and rock leaving the exposed mountain.\n\ndoc520668: Recording Industry Association of America certification.

In popular and historical usage, \"sharpshooter\" and \"marksman\" are considered synonyms.[2][3]  Within the shooting sports and military usages today, however, sharpshooter and marksman refer to distinctly different levels of skill, which are never conflated.  Specifically, in the US Army, \"marksman\" is a rating below \"sharpshooter\" and \"expert\".[1]  Four levels of skill are generally recognized today in both military and civilian shooting circles: unqualified, marksman, sharpshooter, and expert.   Marksmanship badges for the three qualified levels are commonly awarded to both civilian and military shooters who attain proficiency in shooting higher than \"unqualified\".\n\ndoc2439717: Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

The City of Colorado Springs began to pave the highway in 2002 after losing a lawsuit against the Sierra Club, which sued on account of erosion damage to streams, reservoirs, vegetation and wetlands downstream from the 1.5 million tons of road gravel deposited over several decades.[12][13] The local authority paved approximately 10% of the route each year after the order. The 2011 event was the last race with dirt sections, comprising approximately 25% of the course.[3]\n\ndoc1093941: Stone Mountain. In response to Brown v. Board of Education of 1954, and the birth of the Civil Rights Movement, in 1958, at the urging of segregationist Governor Marvin Griffin,[5]:21 the Georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain at a price of $1,125,000.  In 1963, Walker Hancock was selected to complete the carving, and work began in 1964. The carving was completed by Roy Faulkner, who later operated the Stone Mountain Carving Museum (now closed) on nearby Memorial Drive commemorating the carving's history.[15] The carving was completed on March 3, 1972.[16] An extensive archival collection related to the project is now at Emory University, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1915 to 1930; the finding aid provides a history of the project, and an index of the papers contained in the collection.[12]\n\ndoc1551080: Hotspot (geology). Most hotspot volcanoes are basaltic (e.g., Hawaii, Tahiti). As a result, they are less explosive than subduction zone volcanoes, in which water is trapped under the overriding plate. Where hotspots occur in continental regions, basaltic magma rises through the continental crust, which melts to form rhyolites. These rhyolites can form violent eruptions.[7][8] For example, the Yellowstone Caldera was formed by some of the most powerful volcanic explosions in geologic history. However, when the rhyolite is completely erupted, it may be followed by eruptions of basaltic magma rising through the same lithospheric fissures (cracks in the lithosphere). An example of this activity is the Ilgachuz Range in British Columbia, which was created by an early complex series of trachyte and rhyolite eruptions, and late extrusion of a sequence of basaltic lava flows.[9]\n\ndoc2271541: Disc brake. The American Crosley Hot Shot is often given credit for the first production disc brakes. For six months in 1950, Crosley built a car with these brakes, then returned to drum brakes. Lack of sufficient research caused reliability problems, such as sticking and corrosion, especially in regions using salt on winter roads.[8] Drum brake conversions for Hot Shots were quite popular.[8] The Crosley disc was a Goodyear development, a caliper type with ventilated disc, originally designed for aircraft applications.[3]\n\ndoc17173: Hot rod. After World War II there were many small military airports throughout the country that were either abandoned or rarely used that allowed hot rodders across the country to race on marked courses. Originally drag racing had tracks as long as one mile (1.6\u00c2\u00a0km) or more, and included up to four lanes of racing simultaneously. As hot rodding became more popular in the 1950s, magazines and associations catering to hot rodders were started. These were led by Hot Rod Magazine which is the oldest magazine devoted to Hot Rodding started in January 1948. As some hot rodders also raced on the street, a need arose for an organization to promote safety, and to provide venues for safe racing. Hot rodders including Wally Parks created the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) to bring racing off the streets and onto the tracks. They created rules based on safety and entertainment, and allowed Hot Rodders of any caliber the ability to race. The annual California Hot Rod Reunion and National Hot Rod Reunion are held to honor pioneers in the sport. The Wally Parks NHRA Motorsports Museum houses the roots of hot rodding.\n\ndoc704009: Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Glenwood Hot Springs is the largest hot springs facility in town, centrally located across the Colorado River from downtown. The large pool is kept at 93\u00a0\u00b0F (34\u00a0\u00b0C) year round and is the world's largest hot mineral springs pool. The smaller \"Therapy Pool\" averages 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C) year round, preferred by some for its higher mineral content. There is a 107-room lodge, which includes unlimited access to the hot springs and a full hot breakfast for all guests.

The 'Skill at Arms Badge' consists of a representation of crossed .303 Short Magazine Lee\u2013Enfield (SMLE) rifles and is awarded for achieving a prescribed standard of shooting skill. This must be repeated within twelve months for the badge to be awarded in perpetuity to the recipient. The 'Sniper's Badge' is similar in design but incorporates the letter 'S' into the design and is awarded to soldiers who qualify on the Army Sniper's Course. The 'Army Top 20 Badge' consists of crossed .303 SMLE rifles upon a laurel wreath and is awarded to the final 20 competitors in the annual Champion Shot for the Army. The winner of this competition is also awarded the Champion Shots Medal. Only one badge may be worn.[4][5]\n\ndoc1035513: Granite Falls, Minnesota. U.S. Highway 212 and Minnesota State Highways 23 and 67 are three of the main routes in the city.\n\ndoc862728: Rocky Mountain National Park. Lulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came in search of gold and silver.[18] The boom ended by 1883 with miners deserting their claims.[19] The railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881 and the Big Thompson Canyon Road\u2014a section of U.S. Route 34 from Loveland to Estes Park\u2014was completed in 1904.[20] The 1920s saw a boom in building lodges and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938.[21]\n\ndoc1157900: Granite. M-type or mantle derived granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas, generally sourced from the mantle. These are rare, because it is difficult to turn basalt into granite via fractional crystallisation.\n\ndoc378553: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Below follows all currently recognised records. Records set during the most recent running of the event are in bold type.\n\ndoc728945: Hotel rating. The HOTREC (Hotels, Restaurants & Caf\u00c3\u00a9s in Europe) is an umbrella organization for 39 associations from 24 European countries. At a conference in Bergen in 2004, the partners drafted a hotel classification system in order to harmonize their national standards. In 2007 HOTREC launched the European Hospitality Quality scheme (EHQ) which has since accredited the existing national inspection bodies for hotel rating.\n\ndoc1093956: Stone Mountain. In 1887 Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendants of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in the 1950s.\n\ndoc2438388: Hot 'n Now. In 2004, the company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and was then sold to STEN Corporation, which also owns the Burger Time chain.[11] Burger Time was sold to BTND, LLC,[12] which owns the Hot 'N Now name.[13]\n\ndoc2494444: Hot Wells (San Antonio, Texas). Hot Wells claimed its waters would benefit persons with diseases of the skin, liver, and kidney as well as those with rheumatism and even sepsis. Not long after the facility opened, fire destroyed the resort in December 1894, but Shacklett was financially unable to rebuild. Instead, a German immigrant Otto Koehler of Pearl Brewing Company, purchased the property and re-opened it in 1902 as a three-story brick building with eighty rooms.\n\ndoc1093976: Stone Mountain. On summer evenings the mountain hosts the Stone Mountain Laser Show Spectacular, a fireworks and laser light display. The laser lightshow projects moving images of the Deep South as well as Georgia history onto the Confederate Memorial carving on the side of the mountain. During Memorial Day Weekend of 2011, Stone Mountain unveiled its overhaul of the laser show, dubbed Mountainvision. This incorporates digital projectors, lasers, special effects, and pyrotechnics.[47]\n\ndoc378527: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Following world war two, Louis Unser returned to his winning ways at Pikes Peak, winning a further three more times between 1946 and 1970, these wins were tightly contended with rival Al Rogers.[4][5] During this time the event was part of the AAA and USAC IndyCar championship.[9] In 1953, the SCCA sponsors the event, bringing with it an influx of sports cars. In this period the course record was broken every year from 1953 until 1962, this is the largest string of record breaking runs in the event's history. The majority of these records were set by Bobby Unser, the younger brother of Louis.[5] In 1954 motorcycles return to the event, the first time since its inception 1916.[6] The motorcycle overall victory that year went to Bill Meier riding a Harley-Davidson.[7]\n\ndoc1093962: Stone Mountain. Stone Mountain Park, which surrounds the Confederate Memorial, is owned by the state of Georgia and managed by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, a Georgia state authority.  The Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation currently has a long-term contract to operate park attractions while the Stone Mountain Memorial Association retains ownership and the right to reject any project deemed unfit.\n\ndoc869604: Savage Garden. As of 2005, Savage Garden had been certified 12\u00d7 platinum in Australia,[15] 7\u00d7 platinum in the US,[11] 3\u00d7 platinum in Canada,[16] 2\u00d7 platinum in New Zealand, Singapore, and in the UK.[17]\n\ndoc1035517: Granite Falls, Minnesota. The median age in the city was 43 years. 21.5% of residents were under the age of 18; 8.8% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 22.3% were from 25 to 44; 26.9% were from 45 to 64; and 20.7% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.4% male and 51.6% female.\n\ndoc2394396: Lachlan Fold Belt. Granite plutons have formed in many parts of the LFB where there has been significant heating.  They were formed at the time of extension, when hot asthenosphere rose towards the surface.  Granites cover 61000\u00c2\u00a0km2.  There are 875 lithological units of granite.\nThere are 100 volcanic units derived from the same magma as the granites.\n[3]\n\ndoc1551078: Hotspot (geology). In geology, the places known as hotspots or hot spots are volcanic regions thought to be fed by underlying mantle that is anomalously hot compared with the surrounding mantle. Their position on the Earth's surface is independent of tectonic plate boundaries. There are two hypotheses that attempt to explain their origins. One suggests that hotspots are due to mantle plumes that rise as thermal diapirs from the core\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmantle boundary.[1] The other hypothesis is that lithospheric extension permits the passive rising of melt from shallow depths.[2][3] This hypothesis considers the term \"hotspot\" to be a misnomer, asserting that the mantle source beneath them is, in fact, not anomalously hot at all. Well known examples include Hawaii, Iceland and Yellowstone hotspots.\n\ndoc1093934: Stone Mountain. The Stone Mountain pluton continues underground 9 miles (14\u00c2\u00a0km) at its longest point into Gwinnett County. Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as \"the largest exposed piece of granite in the world\".[7] This misconception is most likely a result of misrepresentation by granite companies and early park administration. Stone Mountain, though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite[8] to granite and granodiorite.[9]\n\ndoc2064279: Sierra Nevada (U.S.). The earliest rocks in the Sierra Nevada are metamorphic roof pendants of Paleozoic age, the oldest being metasedimentary rocks from the Cambrian in the Mount Morrison region.[16] These dark-colored hornfels, slates, marbles, and schists are found in the western foothills (notably around Coarsegold, west of the Tehachapi Pass) and east of the Sierra Crest.[17] The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the Triassic period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2\u00c2\u00b0N.[18] In the Triassic and into the Jurassic, an island arc collided with the west coast of North America and raised a chain of volcanoes, in an event called the Nevadan orogeny.[19] Nearly all subaerial Sierran Arc volcanoes have since disappeared; their remains were redeposited during the Great Valley Sequence and the subsequent Cenozoic filling of the Great Valley, which is the source of much of the sedimentary rock in California.\n\ndoc828897: Cascade Volcanoes. 13100 BP Eruption of Glacier Peak\n\ndoc250364: Hot Wheels. The Rear-Loader Beach Bomb is widely considered the \"Holy Grail\" of any Hot Wheels collection. An unknown number were made as test subjects and given to employees. A regular production Beach Bomb may be worth up to $600, depending on condition. Market prices on RLBBs however, have easily reached the five-figure plateau, ranging from $70,000 to $120,000.[9] The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles had a pink RLBB in its Hot Wheels exhibit. It was displayed on a single rotating platform, much like the kind used to showcase precious gems. The Hot Wheels Collectors Club released a new, updated version of the rear loading Beach Bomb in 2002 as a limited edition.\n\ndoc594446: Graniteville, South Carolina. The Graniteville Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[2]\n\ndoc520674: Recording Industry Association of America certification.

The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a hotshot crew in 2008.[5] The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment, including two 10-person crew carriers, was housed.[6] The 2017 film Only the Brave was based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Fire.\n\ndoc1957917: Yarnell Hill Fire. The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough.[19] He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC Captain.[15] Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew entrapment.[5][20] After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew.[5]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery. The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite. A-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic \"hot spot\" activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry. These granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.[10][11]\n\ndoc102124: Hot Coffee mod. On June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled. They are required to \"clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority.\" Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in civil penalties.[22]\n\ndoc3414: Big Sur. By this time Granite Rock's permit had expired. In 2010, the company's president stated that he believed that at some point the company would be allowed to extract the limestone in a way that doesn't harm the environment.[163][164] As of 2017[update], they still own the land, which is zoned WSC/40-D(CZ) for Watershed and Scenic Conservation.[97]\n\ndoc102119: Hot Coffee mod. On August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory recall for all games still owned by the general public.[citation needed] Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the \"uncensored\" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily. However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have grandfathered these copies of the game to their collection.[citation needed]\n\ndoc3412: Big Sur. Mount Pico Blanco is topped by a distinctive white limestone cap, visible from California's Highway One.[160] The Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California has since 1963 owned the mineral rights to 2,800 acres (1,100\u00a0ha), or all of section 36, which sits astride and surrounds the summit of Pico Blanco Mountain. Limestone is a key ingredient in concrete and Pico Blanco contains a particularly high grade deposit, reportedly the largest in California,[161] and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains.[162] In 1980 Granite Rock applied for a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to begin excavating a 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary.[97]\n\ndoc2438387: Hot 'n Now. In October 2003, Proquest Capital Corporation acquired Hot 'n Now assets and some liabilities from Hot 'n Now, LLC. Proquest was soon renamed to Hot Brands, Inc. At the time of acquisition, the chain had 44 locations, 23 corporate and 21 franchisee owned, in three states: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana.[10]\n\ndoc1027307: James Hutton. In 1785 at Glen Tilt in the Cairngorm mountains in the Scottish Highlands, Hutton found granite penetrating metamorphic schists, in a way which indicated that the granite had been molten at the time. This demonstrated to him that granite formed from the cooling of molten rock rather than it precipitating out of water as others at the time believed, and therefore the granite must be younger than the schists.[22][23]\n\ndoc999396: Mount Shasta. The last to form, and the highest cone, the Hotlum Cone, formed about 8,000 years ago. It is named after the Hotlum glacier on its northern face; its longest lava flow, the 500-foot-thick (150-metre) Military Pass flow, extends 5.5\u00a0mi (8.9\u00a0km) down its northeast face. Since the creation of the Hotlum Cone, a dacite dome intruded the cone and now forms the summit. The rock at the 600-foot-wide (180-metre) summit crater has been extensively hydrothermally altered by sulfurous hot springs and fumaroles there (only a few examples still remain).[citation needed]\n\ndoc1957916: Yarnell Hill Fire. On June 30, 19 firefighters with the Prescott Fire Department's interagency Granite Mountain Hotshots were overrun and killed by the fire.[15] Initial reports indicated that one of the firefighters was not a member of the hotshot crew, but Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo later confirmed that all 19 were from the Granite Mountain Hotshots.[16] The firefighters had apparently deployed fire shelters, but not all of the bodies were found inside them.[17] The city of Prescott released the names of the 19 firefighters on July 1.[18]\n\ndoc1451236: Table Mountain. Hiking on Table Mountain is popular amongst locals and tourists, and a number of trails of varying difficulty are available. Because of the steep cliffs around the summit, direct ascents from the city side are limited. Platteklip Gorge, a prominent gorge up the centre of the main table, is a popular and straightforward direct ascent to the summit. Par for the course is about 2.5 hours but is done between 1\u20133 hours depending on one's fitness level. This route is very hot in summer, as it is located on the north facing slope of the mountain, with almost no shade along the 600\u00a0m climb from Tafelberg Road to the Table Mountain plateau.\n\ndoc744403: Trucking industry in the United States. The Hotshot vehicle or truck is essentially a pick-up with a larger load capacity than a personal truck. Hotshots are typically single axle 1-ton to 3-ton trucks, which can be either a dual or single tire.\n\ndoc378524: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The race is self sanctioned and has taken place since 1916.[1][2] It is currently contested by a variety of classes of cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads. There are often numerous new classes tried and discarded year-to-year. On average there are 130 competitors. The PPIHC operates as the Pikes Peak Auto Hill Climb Educational Museum to organize the annual motorsports event.[1]\n\ndoc1157931: Granite. Granite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers, for its steepness, soundness, crack systems, and friction. Well-known venues for granite climbing include Yosemite, the Bugaboos, the Mont Blanc massif (and peaks such as the Aiguille du Dru, the Mountains of Mourne, the Adamello-Presanella Alps, the Aiguille du Midi and the Grandes Jorasses), the Bregaglia, Corsica, parts of the Karakoram (especially the Trango Towers), the Fitzroy Massif, Patagonia, Baffin Island, Ogawayama, the Cornish coast, the Cairngorms, Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the Stawamus Chief, British Columbia, Canada.\n\ndoc3413: Big Sur. After the Forest Service granted the permit, the California Coastal Commission required Graniterock to apply for a coastal development permit in accordance with the requirements of the California Coastal Act. Granite Rock filed suit, claiming that the Coastal Commission permit requirement was preempted by the Forest Service review. When Granite Rock prevailed in the lower courts, the Coastal Commission appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which in a historic 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 decision in 1987, found in favor of the commission.[163]\n\ndoc862779: Rocky Mountain National Park. Gem Lake is high among the rounded granite domes of Lumpy Ridge. Untouched by glaciation, this outcrop of 1.8 billion-year-old granite has been sculpted by wind and chemical erosion into a backbone-like ridge. Pillars, potholes, and balanced rocks are found around the midpoint of the trail, along with views of the Estes Valley and Continental Divide.[74] Potts Puddle trail is accessible from the Black Canyon trail.[74]\n\ndoc1249329: Here Comes the Hotstepper. *sales figures based on certification alone\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\n\ndoc378544: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Established in 2014, the Pikes Peak Challenge Division encompasses a wide variety of class options.\n\ndoc1265647: Enchanted Rock. The Granite Gripper is an annual rock climbing competition that acts as a fund raiser for park conservation through the Friends of Enchanted Rock.[23]\n\ndoc102115: Hot Coffee mod. On August 10, 2005, Rockstar Games officially released a patch for San Andreas.[17] The patch fixed many performance issues and bugs. However, the patch also disabled the controversial \"Hot Coffee\" scenes, even if the \"Hot Coffee\" mod was re-installed.\n\ndoc1157917: Granite. A study of granite countertops was done (initiated and paid for by the Marble Institute of America) in November 2008 by National Health and Engineering Inc. of USA. In this test, all of the 39 full-size granite slabs that were measured for the study showed radiation levels well below the European Union safety standards (section 4.1.1.1 of the National Health and Engineering study) and radon emission levels well below the average outdoor radon concentrations in the US.[22]\n\ndoc752321: Table Mountain Aerial Cableway. In 1993, the son of one of the founders sold the TMACC and the new owners took charge of upgrading the cableway. In 1997, the cableway was reopened after extensive renovations, and new cars were introduced.\n\ndoc999397: Mount Shasta. In the last 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted at least eight or nine times. About 200 years ago the last significant Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a hot lahar (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed 7.5\u00a0mi (12.1\u00a0km) down Mount Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek. A separate hot lahar went 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) down Mud Creek. This eruption was thought to have been observed by the explorer La P\u00e9rouse, from his ship off the California coast, in 1786, but this has been disputed.[29]\n\ndoc1093936: Stone Mountain. The granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont region during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny, which was the time when North America and North Africa collided.  Over time, erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock.  This intrusion of granite also gave rise to Panola Mountain and Arabia Mountain, both in DeKalb County, smaller outcroppings farther south of Stone Mountain.\n\ndoc102114: Hot Coffee mod. On July 29, 2005, as a result of the newly discovered scenes, the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) revoked the game's \"MA15+\" classification (the highest rating then available for computer games in Australia) and changed the game's rating to Refused Classification (RC), which officially banned the original version from being sold in the country. The patched version was given an \"MA15+\" classification on September 12, 2005.[16]\n\ndoc1157899: Granite. The letter-based Chappell & White classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into I-type granite (or igneous protolith) granite and S-type or sedimentary protolith granite.[9] Both of these types of granite are formed by the melting of high grade metamorphic rocks, either other granite or intrusive mafic rocks, or buried sediment, respectively.\n\ndoc1902113: Shooter (2007 film). The mountain top confrontation was shot on Rainbow Glacier, near the resort town of Whistler, British Columbia.[7]\n\ndoc2205301: History of Arizona. On June 30, 2013, nineteen members of the Prescott Fire Department were killed fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire.[47] The fatalities were members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a hotshot crew,[48] of whom only one survived as they were working in another location.[48]\n\ndoc1035514: Granite Falls, Minnesota. Granite Falls, along with the rest of Minnesota, has a humid continental climate[11] with significant differences between seasons. With a July mean temperature of 22.2\u00a0\u00b0C (72.0\u00a0\u00b0F) Granite Falls just falls into the hot-summer zone of the K\u00f6ppen classification of the humid continental climate regime.[12] Winters are cold and dry influenced by arctic air masses affecting it through its continental position, while summers are influenced by humid subtropical air masses bringing hot temperatures and significant rainfall. Transitional periods are very short, since only April and October are between 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) and 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) in daily mean temperatures, with May\u2013September being clearly above and November\u2013March averaging below freezing.[12] The middle three months in each of those cycles are also clearly warmer and colder, respectively, than the months at the beginning or at the end of transitional periods. That is in turn a typical feature of continental climates.\n\ndoc1157916: Granite. There is some concern that some granite sold as countertops or building material may be hazardous to health. Dan Steck of St. Johns University has stated[21] that approximately 5% of all granite is of concern, with the caveat that only a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands of granite slab types have been tested. Various resources from national geological survey organizations are accessible online to assist in assessing the risk factors in granite country and design rules relating, in particular, to preventing accumulation of radon gas in enclosed basements and dwellings.\n\ndoc1267420: Aoraki / Mount Cook. The first recorded attempt on the summit was made by the Irishman Rev. William S. Green and the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss and the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kaufmann on 2 March 1882 via the Tasman and Linda Glaciers.[27] Mt Cook Guidebook author Hugh Logan believe they came within 50\u00c2\u00a0metres of the summit.[28]\n\ndoc1035509: Granite Falls, Minnesota. Granite Falls was platted in 1872.[8] The city was named for deposits of granite rock in the area.[9] A post office has been in operation at Granite Falls since 1870.[10] Granite Falls was incorporated as a city in 1889.[8]\n\ndoc2006709: Pike's Peak Gold Rush. In 1849 and 1850, several parties of gold seekers bound for the California Gold Rush panned small amounts of gold from various streams in the South Platte River valley at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountain gold failed to impress or delay men with visions of unlimited wealth in California, and the discoveries were not reported for several years.[4]\n\ndoc217707: Hard Rock Cafe. In 1990, The Rank Group, a London-based leisure company, acquired Mecca Leisure Group and continued expansion of the concept in its geographic territory. Rank went on to purchase Hard Rock America from Peter Morton as well as Hard Rock Canada from Nick Bitove. After the completion of these acquisitions, Rank gained worldwide control of the brand. In March 2007, the Seminole Tribe of Florida acquired Hard Rock Cafe International, Inc. and other related entities from Rank for US$965 million.[1] In 2008, anonymous members of the wait staff criticized the business because of its practice of paying them less than half the official minimum wage in the UK, with the business allocating tips to staff to bring their salaries within the law. Most customers, it was argued, do not realize that they are subsidizing a low wage when they give the tip.[6]\n\ndoc1957922: Yarnell Hill Fire. A Memorial State Park was created to honor the hotshots. A 2.85 mile path leads from a parking area on Highway 89 up to an observation deck. A trail follows the last steps of the Hotshots down to the fatality site where they made their last stand. Encircling the fatality site, 19 gabions, one for each Hotshot, are united by chains.[31]\n\ndoc1551079: Hotspot (geology). The origins of the concept of hotspots lie in the work of J. Tuzo Wilson, who postulated in 1963 that the formation of the Hawaiian Islands resulted from the slow movement of a tectonic plate across a hot region beneath the surface.[4] It was later postulated that hotspots are fed by narrow streams of hot mantle rising from the Earth's core\u2013mantle boundary in a structure called a mantle plume.[5] Whether or not such mantle plumes exist is the subject of a major controversy in Earth science.[3][6] Estimates for the number of hotspots postulated to be fed by mantle plumes has ranged from about 20 to several thousands, over the years, with most geologists considering a few tens to exist. Hawaii, R\u00e9union, Yellowstone, Gal\u00e1pagos, and Iceland are some of the most active volcanic regions to which the hypothesis is applied.\n\ndoc1954063: Allegheny Mountains. The Homestead, Hot Springs, Virginia has catered to spa enthusiasts since 1766.\n\ndoc2560918: Mount Mazama. Pyroclastic cones at Mazama include Wizard Island, Bald Crater, Maklaks Crater (also known as Diller Cone) and Forgotten Cone. In addition to its crater, referred to as Williams Crater or the Forgotten Crater, Mazama's various volcanic vents occur at Cleetwood, Llao Rock, and Redcloud, which are located at elevations of 7,005 feet (2,135\u00a0m), 8,045 feet (2,452\u00a0m), and 7,949 feet (2,423\u00a0m), respectively. Nearby cinder cones include Bear Butte, Crater Peak, Desert Cone, Lookout Butte, Pothole Butte, Red Cone, Scout Hill, and Union Peak.[1] There are at least 13 cinder cones within Crater Lake National Park, and at least eleven more in the nearby area. They were fed by a different magma chamber than Mazama, though they likely received magma from basaltic andesite reservoirs in the vicinity. The exception is Williams crater, which erupted basalt and dacite and got silicic lava from the western part of Mazama's magma chamber.[66] Stratovolcanoes in Mazama's vicinity consist of Sentinel Rock, Mount Scott, Phantom Cone, Dutton Cliff, and Danger Bay.[1]\n\ndoc1678722: Hot tub. In 2001[25] and in 2012[26] the CPSC issued recalls for spa heaters which overheated and caused fires.\n\ndoc1451213: Table Mountain. The basement rocks are not nearly as resistant to weathering as the TMS, but significant outcrops of the Cape Granite are visible on the western side of Lion's Head, and elsewhere on the Peninsula (especially below Chapman's Peak Drive, and The Boulders near Simon's Town).[6][9][10] The weathered granite soil of the lower slopes of the Peninsula Mountain range are more fertile than the nutrient-poor soils derived from TMS. Most of the vineyards found on the Cape Peninsula are therefore found on these granitic slopes of the Table Mountain range.\n\ndoc378552: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Vintage Motorcycle Record\n\ndoc378549: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Established is 2014, the Pikes Peak Challenge Motorcycle Division encompasses a wide variety of class options.\n\ndoc2266972: Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar. One means of fundraising that Harvest Campaign administrators decided on was to counterstamp some of the coins for sale at premium prices. The letters and numbers are believed to have been punched by the Association, as they are almost entirely uniform. Some were given a state abbreviation and a number, and were sent to be auctioned in various towns. Gibbes reported that the counterstamped pieces sent to South Carolina sold for an average of $23, ranging from $10 to $110, and recommended that the auctions be preceded with the account of the sale of one in Bradenton, Florida, for $1,300.[55] Which town got which number was the luck of the draw.[56] Others were marked with \"U.D.C.\" and a state abbreviation, together with a number which probably represents a membership or chapter number. These were intended for presentation to members deserving of special honor, such as an outgoing president. They did not sell well, as the Association had alienated many UDC members over the firing of Borglum. The Association also announced a program for sale to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, although whether any coins were sold under this program is unclear, as none have been identified.[57] Pieces marked \"G.L.\" and \"S.L.\" were puzzled over by collectors for many years; A. Steve Deitert in the January 2011 edition of The Numismatist identified the markings as \"Gold Lavalier\" and \"Silver Lavalier\". These coins were given to county winners and runners-up in a selling competition for young women.[58]\n\ndoc1548383: Vermont. The towns of Rutland and Barre are the traditional centers of marble and granite quarrying and carving in the U.S. For many years Vermont was also the headquarters of the smallest union in the U.S., the Stonecutters Association, of about 500 members. The first marble quarry in America was on Mount Aeolus overlooking East Dorset.[191] The granite industry attracted numerous skilled stonecutters in the late 19th century from Italy, Scotland, and Ireland. Barre is the location of the Rock of Ages quarry, the largest dimension stone granite quarry in the United States. Vermont is the largest producer of slate in the country. The highest quarrying revenues result from the production of dimension stone.[citation needed] The Rock of Ages quarry in Barre is one of the leading exporters of granite in the country. The work of the sculptors of this corporation can be seen 3 miles (4.8\u00c2\u00a0km) down the road at the Hope Cemetery, where there are gravestones and mausoleums.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2015205: List of hot springs.

In late October 2010, the Beastie Boys sent out two emails regarding the status of Hot Sauce Committee Pts. 1 and 2 to their online mailing list. An email dated October 18 read: \"Although we regret to inform you that Hot Sauce Committee Part 1 will continue to be delayed indefinitely, Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 will be released on time as originally planned in spring of 2011.\"[103] One week later, a second email was sent out, reading as follows:\n\ndoc378547: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.

Following the liquidation of Pike River Coal, Solid Energy purchased the assets of the company\n.[12]\nThe government then purchased the 3580 ha of land around the Pike River Mine. The envirionment minister Nick Smith announced on 15 November 2015 that the 3,580 ha of land is to be added to the Park, and a 45\u00c2\u00a0km walkway, the Pike 29 Memorial Track from Blackball to Punakaikai through the park constructed as a memorial to the 29 miners lost in the 2010 Pike River Mine disaster.\n.[13]\nMost of the families of the victims approved\n[14]\n,[15] \nbut there has been some criticism because Solid Energy decided in 2014 that it was too risky to re-enter the mine to recover any remains from the mine. \n[16]\n\ndoc1093955: Stone Mountain. Granite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the Georgia Railroad in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, the steps to the East Wing of the United States Capitol and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Foundation to be considered for use in a planned monument in King's honor; the foundation later chose to use granite imported from China.[36] Quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.\n\ndoc520666: Recording Industry Association of America certification. The best-selling video box set as certified by the RIAA is The Rolling Stones' Four Flicks DVD compilation from their Licks World Tour, with a 19X Multi-Platinum designation.  This was likely achieved due to exclusive distribution rights owned by Best Buy by their short-lived music production company, Redline Entertainment.[26][27]\n\ndoc961754: Marble Falls, Texas. Marble Falls was founded in 1887 by Adam Rankin Johnson, a former Indian fighter and Confederate general, known as \"Stovepipe\" Johnson for his Civil War escapades, which included duping the Union army in Newburgh, Indiana, with fake \"cannons,\" constructed from stovepipes and wagon wheels. Johnson had viewed the natural Marble Falls during his pre-war days as a Burnet County surveyor, and had dreamed of building an industrial city, powered by the tumbling Colorado River, not to be confused with the river of the same name in Colorado and Arizona. Despite a \"friendly fire\" incident which blinded him near the end of the Civil War, General Johnson followed through with his dream, facilitating the construction of a railroad to nearby Granite Mountain in 1884, then (with ten partners, including one son, one nephew and two sons-in-law) platting the townsite and selling lots, beginning July 12, 1887. Johnson built a fine home, a college (soon to be home of the \"Falls on the Colorado Museum\") and a large factory near the falls. The town grew to a population of 1,800 within ten years.\n\ndoc2015206: List of hot springs. Goudini Spa, Worcester area, Western Cape\n\ndoc643577: Action Park. In 2010, the whole Mountain Creek ski area and water park was sold[8] to a group led by Eugene Mulvihill, the former owner of Great American Recreation and the owner of the adjacent Crystal Springs Resort. It was under the new ownership that the name of the water park was changed back to Action Park, with the park assuming that name when it opened for the 2014 season.[9] In 2016, the Mountain Creek Park name was restored to the park, thus retiring the Action Park name again.\n\ndoc344413: List of cannon projectiles.

The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (PPIHC), also known as The Race to the Clouds, is an annual invitational automobile and motorcycle hill climb to the summit of Pikes Peak, every year on the last Sunday of June. The first running of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb was promoted by Spencer Penrose. Penrose had finished widening the narrow carriage road into a much wider \"Pikes Peak Highway.\" He decided to encourage tourists to visit by creating a race to the clouds.\n\ndoc2485369: Chicxulub crater. It was announced in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, had been found in drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked rocks deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite.[72]\n\ndoc1295703: Curling. Trefor granite comes from the Yr Eifl or Trefor Granite Quarry in the village of Trefor on the north coast of the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in Gwynedd, Wales and has produced granite since 1850. Trefor granite comes in shades of pink, blue and grey.[39] The quarry supplies curling stone granite exclusively to the Canadian, Canada Curling Stone Co., which has been producing stones since 1992 and supplied the stones for the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\ndoc1019563: Beastie Boys. In what can only be described as a bizarre coincidence, following an exhaustive re-sequence marathon, Beastie Boys have verified that their new Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 will be composed of the same 16 tracks originally slated for inclusion on Hot Sauce Committee Part 1. The record (part 2 that is) will be released as planned in spring 2011 on Capitol. The tracks originally recorded for Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 (which now are actually back on Part 1) have now apparently been bumped to make room for the former Hot Sauce Committee Part 1 material. Wait, what?\n\ndoc699607: Jefferson Airplane. Jefferson Airplane held together long enough to record one more album, entitled Long John Silver, begun in April 1972 and released in July. By this time the various members were thoroughly engaged with their various solo projects. Following the release of Kantner and Slick's Sunfighter in November 1971 and Creach's eponymous solo debut in December 1971, Hot Tuna released their first studio album and third opus (Burgers) in February 1972; meanwhile, Joey Covington immersed himself in various Grunt Records projects, including his own solo album (Fat Fandango, released in 1973) and the sessions for Black Kangaroo's debut album (led by Peter Kaukonen, Jorma's younger brother). However, Covington was either dismissed from the band or left of his own volition shortly after the sessions commenced.\n\ndoc428601: Pikes Peak. Pikes Peak is composed of a characteristic pink granite called Pikes Peak granite. The color is due to a large amount of potassium feldspar. It is thought that the granite was once magma that crystallized at least 20 miles (32\u00c2\u00a0km) beneath the Earth's surface, formed by an igneous intrusion during the Precambrian, approximately 1.05 billion years ago, during the Grenville orogeny. Through the process of uplifting, the hardened rock pushed through the Earth's crust and created a dome-like mountain, covered with less resistant rock. Years of erosion and weathering removed the soil and rock leaving the exposed mountain.\n\ndoc520668: Recording Industry Association of America certification.

In popular and historical usage, \"sharpshooter\" and \"marksman\" are considered synonyms.[2][3]  Within the shooting sports and military usages today, however, sharpshooter and marksman refer to distinctly different levels of skill, which are never conflated.  Specifically, in the US Army, \"marksman\" is a rating below \"sharpshooter\" and \"expert\".[1]  Four levels of skill are generally recognized today in both military and civilian shooting circles: unqualified, marksman, sharpshooter, and expert.   Marksmanship badges for the three qualified levels are commonly awarded to both civilian and military shooters who attain proficiency in shooting higher than \"unqualified\".\n\ndoc2439717: Cheyenne Mountain Complex. The Cheyenne Mountain Upgrade (CMU) of November 1988, designed to consolidate five improvement programs, was not installed because it was not compatible with other systems at Cheyenne Mountain and it did not meet the defined specifications according to deficiencies identified during testing.[36]:15 The five improvement programs were the CCPDS Replacement (CCPDS-R), CSS Replacement (CSS-R), Granite Sentry upgrade, SCIS, and SPADOC 4.[37] SPADOC 4 was for upgrading the SCC with primary and backup 3090-200J mainframes),[37] and SPADOC 4 block A achieved initial operating capability (IOC) in April 1989.[38] The CSS-R \"first element\" achieved IOC on April 12, 1991;[39] and the 427M system was replaced c.\u00e2\u20ac\u20301992. The CSSR, SCIS, Granite Sentry, CCPDS-R, and their interfaces were tested in 1997.

The City of Colorado Springs began to pave the highway in 2002 after losing a lawsuit against the Sierra Club, which sued on account of erosion damage to streams, reservoirs, vegetation and wetlands downstream from the 1.5 million tons of road gravel deposited over several decades.[12][13] The local authority paved approximately 10% of the route each year after the order. The 2011 event was the last race with dirt sections, comprising approximately 25% of the course.[3]\n\ndoc1093941: Stone Mountain. In response to Brown v. Board of Education of 1954, and the birth of the Civil Rights Movement, in 1958, at the urging of segregationist Governor Marvin Griffin,[5]:21 the Georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain at a price of $1,125,000.  In 1963, Walker Hancock was selected to complete the carving, and work began in 1964. The carving was completed by Roy Faulkner, who later operated the Stone Mountain Carving Museum (now closed) on nearby Memorial Drive commemorating the carving's history.[15] The carving was completed on March 3, 1972.[16] An extensive archival collection related to the project is now at Emory University, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1915 to 1930; the finding aid provides a history of the project, and an index of the papers contained in the collection.[12]\n\ndoc1551080: Hotspot (geology). Most hotspot volcanoes are basaltic (e.g., Hawaii, Tahiti). As a result, they are less explosive than subduction zone volcanoes, in which water is trapped under the overriding plate. Where hotspots occur in continental regions, basaltic magma rises through the continental crust, which melts to form rhyolites. These rhyolites can form violent eruptions.[7][8] For example, the Yellowstone Caldera was formed by some of the most powerful volcanic explosions in geologic history. However, when the rhyolite is completely erupted, it may be followed by eruptions of basaltic magma rising through the same lithospheric fissures (cracks in the lithosphere). An example of this activity is the Ilgachuz Range in British Columbia, which was created by an early complex series of trachyte and rhyolite eruptions, and late extrusion of a sequence of basaltic lava flows.[9]\n\ndoc2271541: Disc brake. The American Crosley Hot Shot is often given credit for the first production disc brakes. For six months in 1950, Crosley built a car with these brakes, then returned to drum brakes. Lack of sufficient research caused reliability problems, such as sticking and corrosion, especially in regions using salt on winter roads.[8] Drum brake conversions for Hot Shots were quite popular.[8] The Crosley disc was a Goodyear development, a caliper type with ventilated disc, originally designed for aircraft applications.[3]\n\ndoc17173: Hot rod. After World War II there were many small military airports throughout the country that were either abandoned or rarely used that allowed hot rodders across the country to race on marked courses. Originally drag racing had tracks as long as one mile (1.6\u00c2\u00a0km) or more, and included up to four lanes of racing simultaneously. As hot rodding became more popular in the 1950s, magazines and associations catering to hot rodders were started. These were led by Hot Rod Magazine which is the oldest magazine devoted to Hot Rodding started in January 1948. As some hot rodders also raced on the street, a need arose for an organization to promote safety, and to provide venues for safe racing. Hot rodders including Wally Parks created the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) to bring racing off the streets and onto the tracks. They created rules based on safety and entertainment, and allowed Hot Rodders of any caliber the ability to race. The annual California Hot Rod Reunion and National Hot Rod Reunion are held to honor pioneers in the sport. The Wally Parks NHRA Motorsports Museum houses the roots of hot rodding.\n\ndoc704009: Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Glenwood Hot Springs is the largest hot springs facility in town, centrally located across the Colorado River from downtown. The large pool is kept at 93\u00a0\u00b0F (34\u00a0\u00b0C) year round and is the world's largest hot mineral springs pool. The smaller \"Therapy Pool\" averages 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C) year round, preferred by some for its higher mineral content. There is a 107-room lodge, which includes unlimited access to the hot springs and a full hot breakfast for all guests. Spa of the Rockies is an award-winning mineral spa that specializes in natural, mineral based treatments. Other amenities include a full-service athletic club, gift shop and restaurant. Two waterslides, mini golf, and a cold water kiddy pool are open during the warmer months.\n\ndoc378523: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (PPIHC), also known as The Race to the Clouds, is an annual automobile and motorcycle hillclimb to the summit of Pikes Peak in Colorado, USA. The track measures 12.42 miles (19.99\u00a0km) over 156 turns, climbing 4,720\u00a0ft (1,440\u00a0m) from the start at Mile 7 on Pikes Peak Highway, to the finish at 14,110\u00a0ft (4,300\u00a0m), on grades averaging 7.2%.[1][2] It used to consist of both gravel and paved sections, however as of August 2011, the highway is fully paved and as a result all subsequent events will be run on asphalt from start to finish.[3]\n\ndoc1339857: Marksman. In the Australian Army, marksmanship is currently recognized by the award of one of three skill-at-arms badges. The 'Skill at Arms Badge' consists of a representation of crossed .303 Short Magazine Lee\u2013Enfield (SMLE) rifles and is awarded for achieving a prescribed standard of shooting skill. This must be repeated within twelve months for the badge to be awarded in perpetuity to the recipient. The 'Sniper's Badge' is similar in design but incorporates the letter 'S' into the design and is awarded to soldiers who qualify on the Army Sniper's Course. The 'Army Top 20 Badge' consists of crossed .303 SMLE rifles upon a laurel wreath and is awarded to the final 20 competitors in the annual Champion Shot for the Army. The winner of this competition is also awarded the Champion Shots Medal. Only one badge may be worn.[4][5]\n\ndoc1035513: Granite Falls, Minnesota. U.S. Highway 212 and Minnesota State Highways 23 and 67 are three of the main routes in the city.\n\ndoc862728: Rocky Mountain National Park. Lulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came in search of gold and silver.[18] The boom ended by 1883 with miners deserting their claims.[19] The railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881 and the Big Thompson Canyon Road\u2014a section of U.S. Route 34 from Loveland to Estes Park\u2014was completed in 1904.[20] The 1920s saw a boom in building lodges and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938.[21]\n\ndoc1157900: Granite. M-type or mantle derived granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas, generally sourced from the mantle. These are rare, because it is difficult to turn basalt into granite via fractional crystallisation.\n\ndoc378553: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Below follows all currently recognised records.

The HOTREC (Hotels, Restaurants & Caf\u00c3\u00a9s in Europe) is an umbrella organization for 39 associations from 24 European countries. At a conference in Bergen in 2004, the partners drafted a hotel classification system in order to harmonize their national standards. In 2007 HOTREC launched the European Hospitality Quality scheme (EHQ) which has since accredited the existing national inspection bodies for hotel rating.\n\ndoc1093956: Stone Mountain. In 1887 Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendants of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in the 1950s.\n\ndoc2438388: Hot 'n Now. In 2004, the company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and was then sold to STEN Corporation, which also owns the Burger Time chain.[11] Burger Time was sold to BTND, LLC,[12] which owns the Hot 'N Now name.[13]\n\ndoc2494444: Hot Wells (San Antonio, Texas). Hot Wells claimed its waters would benefit persons with diseases of the skin, liver, and kidney as well as those with rheumatism and even sepsis. Not long after the facility opened, fire destroyed the resort in December 1894, but Shacklett was financially unable to rebuild. Instead, a German immigrant Otto Koehler of Pearl Brewing Company, purchased the property and re-opened it in 1902 as a three-story brick building with eighty rooms.\n\ndoc1093976: Stone Mountain. On summer evenings the mountain hosts the Stone Mountain Laser Show Spectacular, a fireworks and laser light display. The laser lightshow projects moving images of the Deep South as well as Georgia history onto the Confederate Memorial carving on the side of the mountain. During Memorial Day Weekend of 2011, Stone Mountain unveiled its overhaul of the laser show, dubbed Mountainvision. This incorporates digital projectors, lasers, special effects, and pyrotechnics.[47]\n\ndoc378527: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Following world war two, Louis Unser returned to his winning ways at Pikes Peak, winning a further three more times between 1946 and 1970, these wins were tightly contended with rival Al Rogers.[4][5] During this time the event was part of the AAA and USAC IndyCar championship.[9] In 1953, the SCCA sponsors the event, bringing with it an influx of sports cars. In this period the course record was broken every year from 1953 until 1962, this is the largest string of record breaking runs in the event's history. The majority of these records were set by Bobby Unser, the younger brother of Louis.[5] In 1954 motorcycles return to the event, the first time since its inception 1916.[6] The motorcycle overall victory that year went to Bill Meier riding a Harley-Davidson.[7]\n\ndoc1093962: Stone Mountain. Stone Mountain Park, which surrounds the Confederate Memorial, is owned by the state of Georgia and managed by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, a Georgia state authority.  The Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation currently has a long-term contract to operate park attractions while the Stone Mountain Memorial Association retains ownership and the right to reject any project deemed unfit.\n\ndoc869604: Savage Garden. As of 2005, Savage Garden had been certified 12\u00d7 platinum in Australia,[15] 7\u00d7 platinum in the US,[11] 3\u00d7 platinum in Canada,[16] 2\u00d7 platinum in New Zealand, Singapore, and in the UK.[17]\n\ndoc1035517: Granite Falls, Minnesota. The median age in the city was 43 years. 21.5% of residents were under the age of 18; 8.8% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 22.3% were from 25 to 44; 26.9% were from 45 to 64; and 20.7% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.4% male and 51.6% female.\n\ndoc2394396: Lachlan Fold Belt. Granite plutons have formed in many parts of the LFB where there has been significant heating.  They were formed at the time of extension, when hot asthenosphere rose towards the surface.  Granites cover 61000\u00c2\u00a0km2.  There are 875 lithological units of granite.\nThere are 100 volcanic units derived from the same magma as the granites.\n[3]\n\ndoc1551078: Hotspot (geology). In geology, the places known as hotspots or hot spots are volcanic regions thought to be fed by underlying mantle that is anomalously hot compared with the surrounding mantle. Their position on the Earth's surface is independent of tectonic plate boundaries. There are two hypotheses that attempt to explain their origins. One suggests that hotspots are due to mantle plumes that rise as thermal diapirs from the core\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmantle boundary.[1] The other hypothesis is that lithospheric extension permits the passive rising of melt from shallow depths.[2][3] This hypothesis considers the term \"hotspot\" to be a misnomer, asserting that the mantle source beneath them is, in fact, not anomalously hot at all. Well known examples include Hawaii, Iceland and Yellowstone hotspots.\n\ndoc1093934: Stone Mountain. The Stone Mountain pluton continues underground 9 miles (14\u00c2\u00a0km) at its longest point into Gwinnett County. Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as \"the largest exposed piece of granite in the world\".[7] This misconception is most likely a result of misrepresentation by granite companies and early park administration. Stone Mountain, though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite[8] to granite and granodiorite.[9]\n\ndoc2064279: Sierra Nevada (U.S.). The earliest rocks in the Sierra Nevada are metamorphic roof pendants of Paleozoic age, the oldest being metasedimentary rocks from the Cambrian in the Mount Morrison region.[16] These dark-colored hornfels, slates, marbles, and schists are found in the western foothills (notably around Coarsegold, west of the Tehachapi Pass) and east of the Sierra Crest.[17] The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the Triassic period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2\u00c2\u00b0N.[18] In the Triassic and into the Jurassic, an island arc collided with the west coast of North America and raised a chain of volcanoes, in an event called the Nevadan orogeny.[19] Nearly all subaerial Sierran Arc volcanoes have since disappeared; their remains were redeposited during the Great Valley Sequence and the subsequent Cenozoic filling of the Great Valley, which is the source of much of the sedimentary rock in California.\n\ndoc828897: Cascade Volcanoes. 13100 BP Eruption of Glacier Peak\n\ndoc250364: Hot Wheels. The Rear-Loader Beach Bomb is widely considered the \"Holy Grail\" of any Hot Wheels collection. An unknown number were made as test subjects and given to employees. A regular production Beach Bomb may be worth up to $600, depending on condition. Market prices on RLBBs however, have easily reached the five-figure plateau, ranging from $70,000 to $120,000.[9] The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles had a pink RLBB in its Hot Wheels exhibit. It was displayed on a single rotating platform, much like the kind used to showcase precious gems. The Hot Wheels Collectors Club released a new, updated version of the rear loading Beach Bomb in 2002 as a limited edition.\n\ndoc594446: Graniteville, South Carolina.

The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a hotshot crew in 2008.[5] The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment, including two 10-person crew carriers, was housed.[6] The 2017 film Only the Brave was based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Fire.\n\ndoc1957917: Yarnell Hill Fire. The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough.[19] He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC Captain.[15] Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew entrapment.[5][20] After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew.[5]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery. The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite. A-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic \"hot spot\" activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry. These granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.[10][11]\n\ndoc102124: Hot Coffee mod. On June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled. They are required to \"clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority.\" Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in civil penalties.[22]\n\ndoc3414: Big Sur. By this time Granite Rock's permit had expired. In 2010, the company's president stated that he believed that at some point the company would be allowed to extract the limestone in a way that doesn't harm the environment.[163][164] As of 2017[update], they still own the land, which is zoned WSC/40-D(CZ) for Watershed and Scenic Conservation.[97]\n\ndoc102119: Hot Coffee mod. On August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory recall for all games still owned by the general public.[citation needed] Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the \"uncensored\" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily. However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have grandfathered these copies of the game to their collection.[citation needed]\n\ndoc3412: Big Sur. Mount Pico Blanco is topped by a distinctive white limestone cap, visible from California's Highway One.[160] The Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California has since 1963 owned the mineral rights to 2,800 acres (1,100\u00a0ha), or all of section 36, which sits astride and surrounds the summit of Pico Blanco Mountain. Limestone is a key ingredient in concrete and Pico Blanco contains a particularly high grade deposit, reportedly the largest in California,[161] and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains.[162] In 1980 Granite Rock applied for a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to begin excavating a 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary.[97]\n\ndoc2438387: Hot 'n Now. In October 2003, Proquest Capital Corporation acquired Hot 'n Now assets and some liabilities from Hot 'n Now, LLC. Proquest was soon renamed to Hot Brands, Inc. At the time of acquisition, the chain had 44 locations, 23 corporate and 21 franchisee owned, in three states: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana.[10]\n\ndoc1027307: James Hutton. In 1785 at Glen Tilt in the Cairngorm mountains in the Scottish Highlands, Hutton found granite penetrating metamorphic schists, in a way which indicated that the granite had been molten at the time. This demonstrated to him that granite formed from the cooling of molten rock rather than it precipitating out of water as others at the time believed, and therefore the granite must be younger than the schists.[22][23]\n\ndoc999396: Mount Shasta. The last to form, and the highest cone, the Hotlum Cone, formed about 8,000 years ago. It is named after the Hotlum glacier on its northern face; its longest lava flow, the 500-foot-thick (150-metre) Military Pass flow, extends 5.5\u00a0mi (8.9\u00a0km) down its northeast face. Since the creation of the Hotlum Cone, a dacite dome intruded the cone and now forms the summit. The rock at the 600-foot-wide (180-metre) summit crater has been extensively hydrothermally altered by sulfurous hot springs and fumaroles there (only a few examples still remain).[citation needed]\n\ndoc1957916: Yarnell Hill Fire. On June 30, 19 firefighters with the Prescott Fire Department's interagency Granite Mountain Hotshots were overrun and killed by the fire.[15] Initial reports indicated that one of the firefighters was not a member of the hotshot crew, but Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo later confirmed that all 19 were from the Granite Mountain Hotshots.[16] The firefighters had apparently deployed fire shelters, but not all of the bodies were found inside them.[17] The city of Prescott released the names of the 19 firefighters on July 1.[18]\n\ndoc1451236: Table Mountain. Hiking on Table Mountain is popular amongst locals and tourists, and a number of trails of varying difficulty are available. Because of the steep cliffs around the summit, direct ascents from the city side are limited. Platteklip Gorge, a prominent gorge up the centre of the main table, is a popular and straightforward direct ascent to the summit. Par for the course is about 2.5 hours but is done between 1\u20133 hours depending on one's fitness level. This route is very hot in summer, as it is located on the north facing slope of the mountain, with almost no shade along the 600\u00a0m climb from Tafelberg Road to the Table Mountain plateau.\n\ndoc744403: Trucking industry in the United States. The Hotshot vehicle or truck is essentially a pick-up with a larger load capacity than a personal truck. Hotshots are typically single axle 1-ton to 3-ton trucks, which can be either a dual or single tire.\n\ndoc378524: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The race is self sanctioned and has taken place since 1916.[1][2] It is currently contested by a variety of classes of cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads. There are often numerous new classes tried and discarded year-to-year. On average there are 130 competitors. The PPIHC operates as the Pikes Peak Auto Hill Climb Educational Museum to organize the annual motorsports event.[1]\n\ndoc1157931: Granite. Granite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers, for its steepness, soundness, crack systems, and friction. Well-known venues for granite climbing include Yosemite, the Bugaboos, the Mont Blanc massif (and peaks such as the Aiguille du Dru, the Mountains of Mourne, the Adamello-Presanella Alps, the Aiguille du Midi and the Grandes Jorasses), the Bregaglia, Corsica, parts of the Karakoram (especially the Trango Towers), the Fitzroy Massif, Patagonia, Baffin Island, Ogawayama, the Cornish coast, the Cairngorms, Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the Stawamus Chief, British Columbia, Canada.\n\ndoc3413: Big Sur. After the Forest Service granted the permit, the California Coastal Commission required Graniterock to apply for a coastal development permit in accordance with the requirements of the California Coastal Act. Granite Rock filed suit, claiming that the Coastal Commission permit requirement was preempted by the Forest Service review. When Granite Rock prevailed in the lower courts, the Coastal Commission appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which in a historic 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 decision in 1987, found in favor of the commission.[163]\n\ndoc862779: Rocky Mountain National Park. Gem Lake is high among the rounded granite domes of Lumpy Ridge. Untouched by glaciation, this outcrop of 1.8 billion-year-old granite has been sculpted by wind and chemical erosion into a backbone-like ridge. Pillars, potholes, and balanced rocks are found around the midpoint of the trail, along with views of the Estes Valley and Continental Divide.[74] Potts Puddle trail is accessible from the Black Canyon trail.[74]\n\ndoc1249329: Here Comes the Hotstepper. *sales figures based on certification alone\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\n\ndoc378544: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.

The Granite Gripper is an annual rock climbing competition that acts as a fund raiser for park conservation through the Friends of Enchanted Rock.[23]\n\ndoc102115: Hot Coffee mod. On August 10, 2005, Rockstar Games officially released a patch for San Andreas.[17] The patch fixed many performance issues and bugs. However, the patch also disabled the controversial \"Hot Coffee\" scenes, even if the \"Hot Coffee\" mod was re-installed.\n\ndoc1157917: Granite. A study of granite countertops was done (initiated and paid for by the Marble Institute of America) in November 2008 by National Health and Engineering Inc. of USA. In this test, all of the 39 full-size granite slabs that were measured for the study showed radiation levels well below the European Union safety standards (section 4.1.1.1 of the National Health and Engineering study) and radon emission levels well below the average outdoor radon concentrations in the US.[22]\n\ndoc752321: Table Mountain Aerial Cableway. In 1993, the son of one of the founders sold the TMACC and the new owners took charge of upgrading the cableway. In 1997, the cableway was reopened after extensive renovations, and new cars were introduced.\n\ndoc999397: Mount Shasta. In the last 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted at least eight or nine times. About 200 years ago the last significant Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a hot lahar (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed 7.5\u00a0mi (12.1\u00a0km) down Mount Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek. A separate hot lahar went 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) down Mud Creek. This eruption was thought to have been observed by the explorer La P\u00e9rouse, from his ship off the California coast, in 1786, but this has been disputed.[29]\n\ndoc1093936: Stone Mountain. The granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont region during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny, which was the time when North America and North Africa collided.  Over time, erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock.  This intrusion of granite also gave rise to Panola Mountain and Arabia Mountain, both in DeKalb County, smaller outcroppings farther south of Stone Mountain.\n\ndoc102114: Hot Coffee mod. On July 29, 2005, as a result of the newly discovered scenes, the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) revoked the game's \"MA15+\" classification (the highest rating then available for computer games in Australia) and changed the game's rating to Refused Classification (RC), which officially banned the original version from being sold in the country. The patched version was given an \"MA15+\" classification on September 12, 2005.[16]\n\ndoc1157899: Granite. The letter-based Chappell & White classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into I-type granite (or igneous protolith) granite and S-type or sedimentary protolith granite.[9] Both of these types of granite are formed by the melting of high grade metamorphic rocks, either other granite or intrusive mafic rocks, or buried sediment, respectively.\n\ndoc1902113: Shooter (2007 film). The mountain top confrontation was shot on Rainbow Glacier, near the resort town of Whistler, British Columbia.[7]\n\ndoc2205301: History of Arizona. On June 30, 2013, nineteen members of the Prescott Fire Department were killed fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire.[47] The fatalities were members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a hotshot crew,[48] of whom only one survived as they were working in another location.[48]\n\ndoc1035514: Granite Falls, Minnesota. Granite Falls, along with the rest of Minnesota, has a humid continental climate[11] with significant differences between seasons. With a July mean temperature of 22.2\u00a0\u00b0C (72.0\u00a0\u00b0F) Granite Falls just falls into the hot-summer zone of the K\u00f6ppen classification of the humid continental climate regime.[12] Winters are cold and dry influenced by arctic air masses affecting it through its continental position, while summers are influenced by humid subtropical air masses bringing hot temperatures and significant rainfall. Transitional periods are very short, since only April and October are between 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) and 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) in daily mean temperatures, with May\u2013September being clearly above and November\u2013March averaging below freezing.[12] The middle three months in each of those cycles are also clearly warmer and colder, respectively, than the months at the beginning or at the end of transitional periods. That is in turn a typical feature of continental climates.\n\ndoc1157916: Granite. There is some concern that some granite sold as countertops or building material may be hazardous to health. Dan Steck of St. Johns University has stated[21] that approximately 5% of all granite is of concern, with the caveat that only a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands of granite slab types have been tested. Various resources from national geological survey organizations are accessible online to assist in assessing the risk factors in granite country and design rules relating, in particular, to preventing accumulation of radon gas in enclosed basements and dwellings.\n\ndoc1267420: Aoraki / Mount Cook. The first recorded attempt on the summit was made by the Irishman Rev. William S. Green and the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss and the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kaufmann on 2 March 1882 via the Tasman and Linda Glaciers.[27] Mt Cook Guidebook author Hugh Logan believe they came within 50\u00c2\u00a0metres of the summit.[28]\n\ndoc1035509: Granite Falls, Minnesota. Granite Falls was platted in 1872.[8] The city was named for deposits of granite rock in the area.[9] A post office has been in operation at Granite Falls since 1870.[10] Granite Falls was incorporated as a city in 1889.[8]\n\ndoc2006709: Pike's Peak Gold Rush. In 1849 and 1850, several parties of gold seekers bound for the California Gold Rush panned small amounts of gold from various streams in the South Platte River valley at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountain gold failed to impress or delay men with visions of unlimited wealth in California, and the discoveries were not reported for several years.[4]\n\ndoc217707: Hard Rock Cafe. In 1990, The Rank Group, a London-based leisure company, acquired Mecca Leisure Group and continued expansion of the concept in its geographic territory. Rank went on to purchase Hard Rock America from Peter Morton as well as Hard Rock Canada from Nick Bitove. After the completion of these acquisitions, Rank gained worldwide control of the brand. In March 2007, the Seminole Tribe of Florida acquired Hard Rock Cafe International, Inc. and other related entities from Rank for US$965 million.[1] In 2008, anonymous members of the wait staff criticized the business because of its practice of paying them less than half the official minimum wage in the UK, with the business allocating tips to staff to bring their salaries within the law. Most customers, it was argued, do not realize that they are subsidizing a low wage when they give the tip.[6]\n\ndoc1957922: Yarnell Hill Fire. A Memorial State Park was created to honor the hotshots. A 2.85 mile path leads from a parking area on Highway 89 up to an observation deck. A trail follows the last steps of the Hotshots down to the fatality site where they made their last stand. Encircling the fatality site, 19 gabions, one for each Hotshot, are united by chains.[31]\n\ndoc1551079: Hotspot (geology). The origins of the concept of hotspots lie in the work of J. Tuzo Wilson, who postulated in 1963 that the formation of the Hawaiian Islands resulted from the slow movement of a tectonic plate across a hot region beneath the surface.[4] It was later postulated that hotspots are fed by narrow streams of hot mantle rising from the Earth's core\u2013mantle boundary in a structure called a mantle plume.[5] Whether or not such mantle plumes exist is the subject of a major controversy in Earth science.[3][6] Estimates for the number of hotspots postulated to be fed by mantle plumes has ranged from about 20 to several thousands, over the years, with most geologists considering a few tens to exist. Hawaii, R\u00e9union, Yellowstone, Gal\u00e1pagos, and Iceland are some of the most active volcanic regions to which the hypothesis is applied.\n\ndoc1954063: Allegheny Mountains. The Homestead, Hot Springs, Virginia has catered to spa enthusiasts since 1766.\n\ndoc2560918: Mount Mazama. Pyroclastic cones at Mazama include Wizard Island, Bald Crater, Maklaks Crater (also known as Diller Cone) and Forgotten Cone. In addition to its crater, referred to as Williams Crater or the Forgotten Crater, Mazama's various volcanic vents occur at Cleetwood, Llao Rock, and Redcloud, which are located at elevations of 7,005 feet (2,135\u00a0m), 8,045 feet (2,452\u00a0m), and 7,949 feet (2,423\u00a0m), respectively. Nearby cinder cones include Bear Butte, Crater Peak, Desert Cone, Lookout Butte, Pothole Butte, Red Cone, Scout Hill, and Union Peak.[1] There are at least 13 cinder cones within Crater Lake National Park, and at least eleven more in the nearby area. They were fed by a different magma chamber than Mazama, though they likely received magma from basaltic andesite reservoirs in the vicinity. The exception is Williams crater, which erupted basalt and dacite and got silicic lava from the western part of Mazama's magma chamber.[66] Stratovolcanoes in Mazama's vicinity consist of Sentinel Rock, Mount Scott, Phantom Cone, Dutton Cliff, and Danger Bay.[1]\n\ndoc1678722: Hot tub. In 2001[25] and in 2012[26] the CPSC issued recalls for spa heaters which overheated and caused fires.\n\ndoc1451213: Table Mountain. The basement rocks are not nearly as resistant to weathering as the TMS, but significant outcrops of the Cape Granite are visible on the western side of Lion's Head, and elsewhere on the Peninsula (especially below Chapman's Peak Drive, and The Boulders near Simon's Town).[6][9][10] The weathered granite soil of the lower slopes of the Peninsula Mountain range are more fertile than the nutrient-poor soils derived from TMS. Most of the vineyards found on the Cape Peninsula are therefore found on these granitic slopes of the Table Mountain range.\n\ndoc378552: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.

One means of fundraising that Harvest Campaign administrators decided on was to counterstamp some of the coins for sale at premium prices. The letters and numbers are believed to have been punched by the Association, as they are almost entirely uniform. Some were given a state abbreviation and a number, and were sent to be auctioned in various towns. Gibbes reported that the counterstamped pieces sent to South Carolina sold for an average of $23, ranging from $10 to $110, and recommended that the auctions be preceded with the account of the sale of one in Bradenton, Florida, for $1,300.[55] Which town got which number was the luck of the draw.[56] Others were marked with \"U.D.C.\" and a state abbreviation, together with a number which probably represents a membership or chapter number. These were intended for presentation to members deserving of special honor, such as an outgoing president. They did not sell well, as the Association had alienated many UDC members over the firing of Borglum. The Association also announced a program for sale to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, although whether any coins were sold under this program is unclear, as none have been identified.[57] Pieces marked \"G.L.\" and \"S.L.\" were puzzled over by collectors for many years; A. Steve Deitert in the January 2011 edition of The Numismatist identified the markings as \"Gold Lavalier\" and \"Silver Lavalier\". These coins were given to county winners and runners-up in a selling competition for young women.[58]\n\ndoc1548383: Vermont. The towns of Rutland and Barre are the traditional centers of marble and granite quarrying and carving in the U.S. For many years Vermont was also the headquarters of the smallest union in the U.S., the Stonecutters Association, of about 500 members. The first marble quarry in America was on Mount Aeolus overlooking East Dorset.[191] The granite industry attracted numerous skilled stonecutters in the late 19th century from Italy, Scotland, and Ireland. Barre is the location of the Rock of Ages quarry, the largest dimension stone granite quarry in the United States. Vermont is the largest producer of slate in the country. The highest quarrying revenues result from the production of dimension stone.[citation needed] The Rock of Ages quarry in Barre is one of the leading exporters of granite in the country. The work of the sculptors of this corporation can be seen 3 miles (4.8\u00c2\u00a0km) down the road at the Hope Cemetery, where there are gravestones and mausoleums.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2015205: List of hot springs.

Granite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the Georgia Railroad in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, the steps to the East Wing of the United States Capitol and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Foundation to be considered for use in a planned monument in King's honor; the foundation later chose to use granite imported from China.[36] Quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.\n\ndoc520666: Recording Industry Association of America certification.

Marble Falls was founded in 1887 by Adam Rankin Johnson, a former Indian fighter and Confederate general, known as \"Stovepipe\" Johnson for his Civil War escapades, which included duping the Union army in Newburgh, Indiana, with fake \"cannons,\" constructed from stovepipes and wagon wheels. Johnson had viewed the natural Marble Falls during his pre-war days as a Burnet County surveyor, and had dreamed of building an industrial city, powered by the tumbling Colorado River, not to be confused with the river of the same name in Colorado and Arizona. Despite a \"friendly fire\" incident which blinded him near the end of the Civil War, General Johnson followed through with his dream, facilitating the construction of a railroad to nearby Granite Mountain in 1884, then (with ten partners, including one son, one nephew and two sons-in-law) platting the townsite and selling lots, beginning July 12, 1887. Johnson built a fine home, a college (soon to be home of the \"Falls on the Colorado Museum\") and a large factory near the falls. The town grew to a population of 1,800 within ten years.\n\ndoc2015206: List of hot springs. Goudini Spa, Worcester area, Western Cape\n\ndoc643577: Action Park. In 2010, the whole Mountain Creek ski area and water park was sold[8] to a group led by Eugene Mulvihill, the former owner of Great American Recreation and the owner of the adjacent Crystal Springs Resort. It was under the new ownership that the name of the water park was changed back to Action Park, with the park assuming that name when it opened for the 2014 season.[9] In 2016, the Mountain Creek Park name was restored to the park, thus retiring the Action Park name again.\n\ndoc344413: List of cannon projectiles.

The first running of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb was promoted by Spencer Penrose. Penrose had finished widening the narrow carriage road into a much wider \"Pikes Peak Highway.\" He decided to encourage tourists to visit by creating a race to the clouds.\n\ndoc2485369: Chicxulub crater. It was announced in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, had been found in drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked rocks deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite.[72]\n\ndoc1295703: Curling. Trefor granite comes from the Yr Eifl or Trefor Granite Quarry in the village of Trefor on the north coast of the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in Gwynedd, Wales and has produced granite since 1850. Trefor granite comes in shades of pink, blue and grey.[39] The quarry supplies curling stone granite exclusively to the Canadian, Canada Curling Stone Co., which has been producing stones since 1992 and supplied the stones for the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\ndoc1019563: Beastie Boys. In what can only be described as a bizarre coincidence, following an exhaustive re-sequence marathon, Beastie Boys have verified that their new Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 will be composed of the same 16 tracks originally slated for inclusion on Hot Sauce Committee Part 1. The record (part 2 that is) will be released as planned in spring 2011 on Capitol. The tracks originally recorded for Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 (which now are actually back on Part 1) have now apparently been bumped to make room for the former Hot Sauce Committee Part 1 material.

By this time the various members were thoroughly engaged with their various solo projects. Following the release of Kantner and Slick's Sunfighter in November 1971 and Creach's eponymous solo debut in December 1971, Hot Tuna released their first studio album and third opus (Burgers) in February 1972; meanwhile, Joey Covington immersed himself in various Grunt Records projects, including his own solo album (Fat Fandango, released in 1973) and the sessions for Black Kangaroo's debut album (led by Peter Kaukonen, Jorma's younger brother). However, Covington was either dismissed from the band or left of his own volition shortly after the sessions commenced.\n\ndoc428601: Pikes Peak. Pikes Peak is composed of a characteristic pink granite called Pikes Peak granite. The color is due to a large amount of potassium feldspar. It is thought that the granite was once magma that crystallized at least 20 miles (32\u00c2\u00a0km) beneath the Earth's surface, formed by an igneous intrusion during the Precambrian, approximately 1.05 billion years ago, during the Grenville orogeny. Through the process of uplifting, the hardened rock pushed through the Earth's crust and created a dome-like mountain, covered with less resistant rock. Years of erosion and weathering removed the soil and rock leaving the exposed mountain.\n\ndoc520668: Recording Industry Association of America certification.

Board of Education of 1954, and the birth of the Civil Rights Movement, in 1958, at the urging of segregationist Governor Marvin Griffin,[5]:21 the Georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain at a price of $1,125,000.  In 1963, Walker Hancock was selected to complete the carving, and work began in 1964. The carving was completed by Roy Faulkner, who later operated the Stone Mountain Carving Museum (now closed) on nearby Memorial Drive commemorating the carving's history.[15] The carving was completed on March 3, 1972.[16] An extensive archival collection related to the project is now at Emory University, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1915 to 1930; the finding aid provides a history of the project, and an index of the papers contained in the collection.[12]\n\ndoc1551080: Hotspot (geology). Most hotspot volcanoes are basaltic (e.g., Hawaii, Tahiti). As a result, they are less explosive than subduction zone volcanoes, in which water is trapped under the overriding plate. Where hotspots occur in continental regions, basaltic magma rises through the continental crust, which melts to form rhyolites. These rhyolites can form violent eruptions.[7][8] For example, the Yellowstone Caldera was formed by some of the most powerful volcanic explosions in geologic history. However, when the rhyolite is completely erupted, it may be followed by eruptions of basaltic magma rising through the same lithospheric fissures (cracks in the lithosphere). An example of this activity is the Ilgachuz Range in British Columbia, which was created by an early complex series of trachyte and rhyolite eruptions, and late extrusion of a sequence of basaltic lava flows.[9]\n\ndoc2271541: Disc brake. The American Crosley Hot Shot is often given credit for the first production disc brakes. For six months in 1950, Crosley built a car with these brakes, then returned to drum brakes. Lack of sufficient research caused reliability problems, such as sticking and corrosion, especially in regions using salt on winter roads.[8] Drum brake conversions for Hot Shots were quite popular.[8] The Crosley disc was a Goodyear development, a caliper type with ventilated disc, originally designed for aircraft applications.[3]\n\ndoc17173: Hot rod. After World War II there were many small military airports throughout the country that were either abandoned or rarely used that allowed hot rodders across the country to race on marked courses. Originally drag racing had tracks as long as one mile (1.6\u00c2\u00a0km) or more, and included up to four lanes of racing simultaneously. As hot rodding became more popular in the 1950s, magazines and associations catering to hot rodders were started. These were led by Hot Rod Magazine which is the oldest magazine devoted to Hot Rodding started in January 1948. As some hot rodders also raced on the street, a need arose for an organization to promote safety, and to provide venues for safe racing. Hot rodders including Wally Parks created the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) to bring racing off the streets and onto the tracks. They created rules based on safety and entertainment, and allowed Hot Rodders of any caliber the ability to race. The annual California Hot Rod Reunion and National Hot Rod Reunion are held to honor pioneers in the sport. The Wally Parks NHRA Motorsports Museum houses the roots of hot rodding.\n\ndoc704009: Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Glenwood Hot Springs is the largest hot springs facility in town, centrally located across the Colorado River from downtown. The large pool is kept at 93\u00a0\u00b0F (34\u00a0\u00b0C) year round and is the world's largest hot mineral springs pool. The smaller \"Therapy Pool\" averages 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C) year round, preferred by some for its higher mineral content. There is a 107-room lodge, which includes unlimited access to the hot springs and a full hot breakfast for all guests. Spa of the Rockies is an award-winning mineral spa that specializes in natural, mineral based treatments. Other amenities include a full-service athletic club, gift shop and restaurant. Two waterslides, mini golf, and a cold water kiddy pool are open during the warmer months.\n\ndoc378523: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (PPIHC), also known as The Race to the Clouds, is an annual automobile and motorcycle hillclimb to the summit of Pikes Peak in Colorado, USA. The track measures 12.42 miles (19.99\u00a0km) over 156 turns, climbing 4,720\u00a0ft (1,440\u00a0m) from the start at Mile 7 on Pikes Peak Highway, to the finish at 14,110\u00a0ft (4,300\u00a0m), on grades averaging 7.2%.[1][2] It used to consist of both gravel and paved sections, however as of August 2011, the highway is fully paved and as a result all subsequent events will be run on asphalt from start to finish.[3]\n\ndoc1339857: Marksman. In the Australian Army, marksmanship is currently recognized by the award of one of three skill-at-arms badges. The 'Skill at Arms Badge' consists of a representation of crossed .303 Short Magazine Lee\u2013Enfield (SMLE) rifles and is awarded for achieving a prescribed standard of shooting skill. This must be repeated within twelve months for the badge to be awarded in perpetuity to the recipient. The 'Sniper's Badge' is similar in design but incorporates the letter 'S' into the design and is awarded to soldiers who qualify on the Army Sniper's Course. The 'Army Top 20 Badge' consists of crossed .303 SMLE rifles upon a laurel wreath and is awarded to the final 20 competitors in the annual Champion Shot for the Army. The winner of this competition is also awarded the Champion Shots Medal. Only one badge may be worn.[4][5]\n\ndoc1035513: Granite Falls, Minnesota. U.S. Highway 212 and Minnesota State Highways 23 and 67 are three of the main routes in the city.\n\ndoc862728: Rocky Mountain National Park. Lulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came in search of gold and silver.[18] The boom ended by 1883 with miners deserting their claims.[19] The railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881 and the Big Thompson Canyon Road\u2014a section of U.S. Route 34 from Loveland to Estes Park\u2014was completed in 1904.[20] The 1920s saw a boom in building lodges and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938.[21]\n\ndoc1157900: Granite. M-type or mantle derived granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas, generally sourced from the mantle. These are rare, because it is difficult to turn basalt into granite via fractional crystallisation.\n\ndoc378553: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Below follows all currently recognised records. Records set during the most recent running of the event are in bold type.\n\ndoc728945: Hotel rating. The HOTREC (Hotels, Restaurants & Caf\u00c3\u00a9s in Europe) is an umbrella organization for 39 associations from 24 European countries. At a conference in Bergen in 2004, the partners drafted a hotel classification system in order to harmonize their national standards. In 2007 HOTREC launched the European Hospitality Quality scheme (EHQ) which has since accredited the existing national inspection bodies for hotel rating.\n\ndoc1093956: Stone Mountain. In 1887 Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendants of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in the 1950s.\n\ndoc2438388: Hot 'n Now. In 2004, the company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and was then sold to STEN Corporation, which also owns the Burger Time chain.[11] Burger Time was sold to BTND, LLC,[12] which owns the Hot 'N Now name.[13]\n\ndoc2494444: Hot Wells (San Antonio, Texas). Hot Wells claimed its waters would benefit persons with diseases of the skin, liver, and kidney as well as those with rheumatism and even sepsis. Not long after the facility opened, fire destroyed the resort in December 1894, but Shacklett was financially unable to rebuild. Instead, a German immigrant Otto Koehler of Pearl Brewing Company, purchased the property and re-opened it in 1902 as a three-story brick building with eighty rooms.\n\ndoc1093976: Stone Mountain. On summer evenings the mountain hosts the Stone Mountain Laser Show Spectacular, a fireworks and laser light display. The laser lightshow projects moving images of the Deep South as well as Georgia history onto the Confederate Memorial carving on the side of the mountain. During Memorial Day Weekend of 2011, Stone Mountain unveiled its overhaul of the laser show, dubbed Mountainvision. This incorporates digital projectors, lasers, special effects, and pyrotechnics.[47]\n\ndoc378527: Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Following world war two, Louis Unser returned to his winning ways at Pikes Peak, winning a further three more times between 1946 and 1970, these wins were tightly contended with rival Al Rogers.[4][5] During this time the event was part of the AAA and USAC IndyCar championship.[9] In 1953, the SCCA sponsors the event, bringing with it an influx of sports cars. In this period the course record was broken every year from 1953 until 1962, this is the largest string of record breaking runs in the event's history. The majority of these records were set by Bobby Unser, the younger brother of Louis.[5] In 1954 motorcycles return to the event, the first time since its inception 1916.[6] The motorcycle overall victory that year went to Bill Meier riding a Harley-Davidson.[7]\n\ndoc1093962: Stone Mountain. Stone Mountain Park, which surrounds the Confederate Memorial, is owned by the state of Georgia and managed by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, a Georgia state authority.  The Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation currently has a long-term contract to operate park attractions while the Stone Mountain Memorial Association retains ownership and the right to reject any project deemed unfit.\n\ndoc869604: Savage Garden. As of 2005, Savage Garden had been certified 12\u00d7 platinum in Australia,[15] 7\u00d7 platinum in the US,[11] 3\u00d7 platinum in Canada,[16] 2\u00d7 platinum in New Zealand, Singapore, and in the UK.[17]\n\ndoc1035517: Granite Falls, Minnesota. The median age in the city was 43 years. 21.5% of residents were under the age of 18; 8.8% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 22.3% were from 25 to 44; 26.9% were from 45 to 64; and 20.7% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.4% male and 51.6% female.\n\ndoc2394396: Lachlan Fold Belt. Granite plutons have formed in many parts of the LFB where there has been significant heating.  They were formed at the time of extension, when hot asthenosphere rose towards the surface.  Granites cover 61000\u00c2\u00a0km2.  There are 875 lithological units of granite.\nThere are 100 volcanic units derived from the same magma as the granites.\n[3]\n\ndoc1551078: Hotspot (geology). In geology, the places known as hotspots or hot spots are volcanic regions thought to be fed by underlying mantle that is anomalously hot compared with the surrounding mantle. Their position on the Earth's surface is independent of tectonic plate boundaries. There are two hypotheses that attempt to explain their origins. One suggests that hotspots are due to mantle plumes that rise as thermal diapirs from the core\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmantle boundary.[1] The other hypothesis is that lithospheric extension permits the passive rising of melt from shallow depths.[2][3] This hypothesis considers the term \"hotspot\" to be a misnomer, asserting that the mantle source beneath them is, in fact, not anomalously hot at all. Well known examples include Hawaii, Iceland and Yellowstone hotspots.\n\ndoc1093934: Stone Mountain. The Stone Mountain pluton continues underground 9 miles (14\u00c2\u00a0km) at its longest point into Gwinnett County. Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as \"the largest exposed piece of granite in the world\".[7] This misconception is most likely a result of misrepresentation by granite companies and early park administration. Stone Mountain, though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite[8] to granite and granodiorite.[9]\n\ndoc2064279: Sierra Nevada (U.S.). The earliest rocks in the Sierra Nevada are metamorphic roof pendants of Paleozoic age, the oldest being metasedimentary rocks from the Cambrian in the Mount Morrison region.[16] These dark-colored hornfels, slates, marbles, and schists are found in the western foothills (notably around Coarsegold, west of the Tehachapi Pass) and east of the Sierra Crest.[17] The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the Triassic period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2\u00c2\u00b0N.[18] In the Triassic and into the Jurassic, an island arc collided with the west coast of North America and raised a chain of volcanoes, in an event called the Nevadan orogeny.[19] Nearly all subaerial Sierran Arc volcanoes have since disappeared; their remains were redeposited during the Great Valley Sequence and the subsequent Cenozoic filling of the Great Valley, which is the source of much of the sedimentary rock in California.\n\ndoc828897: Cascade Volcanoes. 13100 BP Eruption of Glacier Peak\n\ndoc250364: Hot Wheels. The Rear-Loader Beach Bomb is widely considered the \"Holy Grail\" of any Hot Wheels collection. An unknown number were made as test subjects and given to employees. A regular production Beach Bomb may be worth up to $600, depending on condition. Market prices on RLBBs however, have easily reached the five-figure plateau, ranging from $70,000 to $120,000.[9] The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles had a pink RLBB in its Hot Wheels exhibit. It was displayed on a single rotating platform, much like the kind used to showcase precious gems. The Hot Wheels Collectors Club released a new, updated version of the rear loading Beach Bomb in 2002 as a limited edition.\n\ndoc594446: Graniteville, South Carolina. The Graniteville Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[2]\n\ndoc520674: Recording Industry Association of America certification.
