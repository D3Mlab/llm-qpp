Meanwhile, the land of Narnia remains the domain of animals (chosen animals are given the ability to speak, and become pillars of society) and is not troubled by the Witch nor any other enemy for many hundred years.\n\ndoc797849: The Chronicles of Narnia. Jadis, commonly known during her rule of Narnia as the White Witch, is the main antagonist of The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. She is the witch responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting in the Hundred Year Winter. The White Witch was born in the world of Charn, before the creation of Narnia, and died in battle in Narnian year 1000.\n\ndoc62362: White Witch. Many years later, a 12-year-old Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer arrive in the ruins of Charn through Digory's uncle's magic. The children find the bell that Jadis left to break the spell. Despite Polly's warning not to ring the bell, Digory does so. Jadis is awakened and by holding on to them is transported with them back to London in the year 1900. She initially aims to conquer the world to which she is transported, but finds that her magic does not work there. Digory, seeking to correct his mistake, attempts to transport her back to Charn, but they end up instead in the world of Narnia at the moment of its creation by the lion Aslan. As Aslan approaches, she attacks him with the rod of iron she has torn by main strength from a London lamp post; but when this has no effect, she flees.\n\ndoc62366: White Witch. She styles herself \"Her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands\", and she casts Narnia into an endless winter with no Christmas. She fears a prophecy that four humans, two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve, will cause her downfall, and orders all Narnians - including those who might oppose her - to bring any human they come across to her.\n\ndoc62363: White Witch. Jadis makes her way to the garden on a mountain west of Narnia, where she eats an apple that she believes will make her immortal and give her eternal life. However, this supposed immortality comes at a cost: her skin is bleached white, and the evil in her heart causes her eternal misery. She cannot stand the sight of the tree that Aslan has Digory plant in Narnia from the fruit of the garden, and she thus stays to the north of Narnia, working to develop her magic.\n\ndoc62379: White Witch. In the 2005 Walt Disney Pictures feature film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, she was portrayed by British actress Tilda Swinton. Swinton's performance won particular acclaim among fans and critics. BBC film critic Stella Papamichael wrote:[3]\n\ndoc62367: White Witch. By the time the Pevensie children arrive in Narnia, Jadis has ruled for 100 years. She first meets Edmund Pevensie, enchants him with magical Turkish delight, and tempts him to betray his siblings by offering to make him her heir and bring them to Narnia with him, although at this stage only Edmund and his sister Lucy have been in Narnia. The four Pevensie children all arrive in Narnia together soon afterwards, and Edmund strays to the Witch after he and the other children are taken in by Mr and Mrs Beaver. He had realised that the \"Queen of Narnia\" (as she had introduced herself) and the White Witch were one and the same after a conversation with Lucy, but was still determined to taste more Turkish Delight and remained convinced that the Witch would deliver her promise to make him heir to her throne.\n\ndoc62365: White Witch. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, set 1,000 Narnian years after the events of The Magician's Nephew, Jadis has usurped power over Narnia after the tree that kept her at bay had died. Now known as the White Witch, she is served by various races including Wolves (who make up her secret police), Black Dwarves, Giants, Werewolves, Tree Spirits that are on her side, Ghouls, Boggles, Ogres, Minotaurs, Cruels, Hags, Spectres, People of the Toadstools, Incubi, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Orknies, Sprites, Wooses, Ettins, Poisonous Plant Spirits, Evil Apes, Giant Bats, Vultures, and creatures that according to C. S. Lewis are \"so horrible that if I told you, your parents probably wouldn't let you read this book.\" Her magic is now powerful, and she has acquired a wand with which she can turn enemies to stone if they displease or attempt to challenge her in any way.\n\ndoc62357: White Witch. Jadis is the main antagonist of The Magician's Nephew and of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in C. S. Lewis's series, The Chronicles of Narnia. She is commonly referred to as the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, as she is the Witch who froze Narnia in the Hundred Years Winter.\n\ndoc62382: White Witch. Swinton reprised her role as the White Witch in the 2008 Disney Movie sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. In a departure from the novel, Nikabrik and his fellow conspirators manage to conjure an apparition of Jadis within a mystical wall of ice and attempt to offer her Caspian X as she needs a drop of blood from a son of Adam to fully resurrect herself. She tries to coax Caspian into offering her his blood and then from Peter, promising to lend her powers to their fight against King Miraz once she is made whole. However, Edmund shatters the ice before the Witch can obtain a drop of blood, and the apparition vanishes.\n\ndoc62368: White Witch. But with the approach of Aslan, her magical winter thaws, and Edmund is rescued after his treason. He had been greeted with a hostile reception from the White Witch after arriving at her castle alone, and even more so after informing her that Aslan had come to Narnia. The harshness of the Witch's winter had made Edmund realise that he had been wrong in thinking that her side was the right side to be on, and he realised the full extent of her evil when he witnessed her turning a party of creatures into stone after their revelation that Father Christmas had been in Narnia - much to the Witch's horror after she had banished him.\n\ndoc62360: White Witch. (This reference to Lilith is a tribute to the fantasy novel with this title by George MacDonald, a literary hero of C.S. Lewis.) Jadis died in battle in Narnian year 1000, meaning that she lived for well over 1,000 years.\n\ndoc62370: White Witch. She is unaware, however, that due to a deeper magic from before Narnia's founding, that Aslan's life will be restored as he was an innocent, willing victim who had offered his life in a traitor's stead. Aslan then reaches her castle and restores all her statues to life, and brings them as reinforcements to the battle at Beruna against the witch's army. Her army is defeated, and Aslan himself kills Jadis, while most of her followers are killed and the remnants of her army flee and are eventually killed by Aslan's followers, who now serve Narnia under their new rulers.\n\ndoc62359: White Witch. Jadis was born on an unknown date long before the creation of Narnia. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe she is identified as a descendant of Adam's first wife (Lilith) and the giants:\n\ndoc337981: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game). The fantasy land of Narnia has been under the spell of the evil White Witch, who makes it always winter but never Christmas, but when Aslan comes, it will be spring again and the Witch's reign will be over. Four children enter Narnia and, along with the legendary lion, Aslan, help defeat the White Witch and her evil minions.(This version is based on the 2005 film.)\n\ndoc374344: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a 2005 British-American high fantasy film directed by Andrew Adamson and based on The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the first published and second chronological novel in C. S. Lewis's children's epic fantasy series, The Chronicles of Narnia. It was co-produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures. William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley play Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, four British children evacuated during the Blitz to the countryside, who find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There they ally with the Lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) against the forces of Jadis, the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).\n\ndoc73647: The Chronicles of Narnia (film series). The series revolves around the adventures of children in the world of Narnia, guided by Aslan, a wise and powerful lion that can speak and is the true king of Narnia. The children heavily featured in the films are the Pevensie siblings, and a prominent antagonist is the White Witch (also known as Jadis).\n\ndoc374349: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. One night, Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, entering Narnia. After searching for Lucy, meets the White Witch, who claims to be queen. She offers him Turkish Delight and the prospect of becoming king if he brings his siblings to her castle. After she departs, Edmund and Lucy meet again and return. Lucy tells Peter and Susan what happened, but Edmund lies. Professor Kirke suggests she is telling the truth, though they remain unconvinced.\n\ndoc376717: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. In 1940, four siblings \u2013 Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie \u2013 are among many children evacuated from London during World War II to escape the Blitz. They are sent to the countryside to live with professor Digory Kirke. Exploring the professor's house, Lucy finds a wardrobe which doubles as a magic portal to a forest in a land called Narnia. At a lamppost oddly located in the forest, she meets Tumnus, a faun, who invites her to tea in his home. There the faun confesses that he invited her not out of hospitality, but with the intention of betraying her to the White Witch. The witch has ruled Narnia for years, using magic to keep it frozen in a perpetual winter. She has ordered all Narnians to turn in any humans (\"Sons of Adam\" or \"Daughters of Eve\") they come across. But now that he has come to know and like a human, Tumnus repents his original intention and escorts Lucy back to the lamppost.\n\ndoc374350: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While running away from Mrs. Macready after accidentally breaking a window, the four siblings retreat to the wardrobe and enter Narnia. They discover the Witch has taken Mr. Tumnus, and they meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who tell them about Aslan. According to the beavers, Aslan intends to take control of Narnia from the Witch. The four must help Aslan; it has been prophesied that if two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit in the four thrones, the White Witch's reign will end.\n\ndoc73654: The Chronicles of Narnia (film series). The story follows the four British Pevensie siblings, who are evacuated during the Blitz to the countryside, where they find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There, they must ally with the lion Aslan against the forces of the White Witch, who has placed Narnia in an eternal winter.\n\ndoc797878: The Chronicles of Narnia. Lev Grossman's New York Times best-seller The Magicians is a contemporary dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the magical land of his favourite childhood books. Fillory is a thinly veiled substitute for Narnia, and clearly the author expects it to be experienced as such. Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock in the home of an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II. Moreover, the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised by The Watcherwoman. She, like the White Witch, freezes the land in time. The book's plot revolves heavily around a place very like the \"wood between the worlds\" from The Magician's Nephew, an interworld waystation in which pools of water lead to other lands. This reference to The Magician's Nephew is echoed in the title of the book.[51]\n\ndoc374356: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. With the exception of Tilda Swinton, who was the first choice to play Jadis, the White Witch,[6] casting was a long process. Beginning in 2002,[7] Adamson went through 2500 audition tapes, met 1800 children and workshopped 400 before coming down to the final four actors for the Pevensies. Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting, whilst Henley and Keynes were cast relatively late.[8] Moseley was cast because casting director Pippa Hall remembered she cast him as an extra in Cider with Rosie (1998). He beat 3000 boys to the role of Peter and quit school to learn all his lines.[9]\n\ndoc376720: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Soon afterward, all four children enter Narnia together after hiding in the wardrobe to avoid the professor's dour housekeeper, Mrs. Macready. Remembering the winter cold ahead, they take coats from the wardrobe before exploring. Lucy guides them to Tumnus's cave, but they find it ransacked, with a notice from Jadis (the White Witch) proclaiming his arrest for harbouring humans.\n\ndoc62376: White Witch. Though her magic disappears when she leaves Charn, she manages to build it up again in Narnia's world, exercising both her previous experience and her privilege to witness a new world's dawning, to become again a sorceress of formidable power. In her own dominion, Charn, Jadis is extremely powerful; but she finds her magic largely useless in other worlds. She eventually strengthens her powers and usurps the throne of Narnia, using her magic to cast the land into perpetual winter. Her most feared weapon is her wand, whose magic is capable of turning people into stone. The petrified remains of her enemies decorate the halls of her castle. Her other powers, which she immediately loses after entering another world, include the ability to disintegrate objects and individuals, read minds, control the minds of animals (She does possibly retain or regain this power in Narnia) and the terrifying power of the Deplorable Word - the latter of which wipes out every living thing on a planet except for the speaker. For the brief period of time that Jadis is on Earth, she is shown to have no magical power, but to retain her phenomenal strength. This is demonstrated when she battles with Metropolitan Police in London, wielding the cross-bar she wrenched from a lamp post. The same cross-bar was taken into the new world that would become Narnia, and grew into the full lamp post encountered by Lucy Pevensie many years later.\n\ndoc62374: White Witch. An extraordinarily beautiful, tall and imposing woman, Jadis enchants Digory Kirke, Andrew Ketterley and Edmund Pevensie on first encounters. She is seven feet tall, as were all members of the Royal Family of Charn. After eating the fruit of eternal life, her skin becomes as white as paper.\n\ndoc374348: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While the Pevensies play hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a wardrobe and enters the fantasy world called Narnia. Seeing a lamppost, Lucy encounters the faun Mr. Tumnus, who invites her to his home. He puts Lucy to sleep by playing a lullaby on his flute. When Lucy wakes up, she finds Tumnus grieving. He explains that Jadis, the White Witch, has cursed Narnia to a hundred years of winter. If a human is encountered, they are to be brought to her. Tumnus cannot bring himself to kidnap Lucy, so he sends her home. When she returns to Professor Kirke's house, hardly any time has passed, and her siblings disbelieve her story.\n\ndoc910362: Aslan. With her greatest adversary dead, the White Witch leaves with her army to prepare for war against the Narnians, convinced that she will win. Lucy, Susan, and a number of mice remove the bonds from Aslan's body; but as the Stone Table breaks they find that his body is gone. To their shock, Aslan reappears alive and well, thanks to a Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time. The Witch, having entered Narnia only at the Dawn of Time, had not known of this. Aslan explains that the Deeper Magic is invoked when an innocent willingly offers his life in place of a traitor's, causing death itself to be reversed until the victim is reborn.\n\ndoc374353: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The White Witch journeys to Aslan's camp and claims Edmund, but Aslan secretly offers to sacrifice himself instead. That night, as Lucy and Susan covertly watch, the White Witch fatally stabs Aslan. In the morning, he is resurrected, citing magic beyond the Witch's understanding. Aslan takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle, where he frees the prisoners she turned to stone. Edmund persuades Peter to lead Aslan's army. While saving Peter from the Witch, Edmund is mortally wounded. As the Witch fights Peter, Aslan arrives with reinforcements and kills her. After Edmund is revived by Lucy's cordial, the Pevensies are crowned King Peter the Magnificent, Queen Susan the Gentle, King Edmund the Just, and Queen Lucy the Valiant.\n\ndoc376716: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Most of the novel is set in Narnia, a land of talking animals and mythical creatures that one White Witch has ruled for 100 years of deep winter. In the frame story, four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a wartime evacuation. The youngest visits Narnia three times via the magic of a wardrobe in a spare room. All four children are together on her third visit, which verifies her fantastic claims and comprises the subsequent 12 of 17 chapters except for a brief conclusion. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfill an old prophecy and so are soon adventuring both to save Narnia and their lives. Lewis wrote the book for, and dedicated it to, his goddaughter Lucy Barfield. She was the daughter of Owen Barfield, Lewis's friend, teacher, adviser, and trustee.[4]\n\ndoc797841: The Chronicles of Narnia. Echoing the Christian theme of betrayal, repentance, and subsequent redemption via blood sacrifice, Edmund betrays his siblings to Jadis, the White Witch, but quickly realises the true nature of the witch and her evil intentions towards his siblings, and joins Aslan's side. At that point he is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan's life and he joins the fight against the White Witch. Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan, and of all the human characters who visit Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most.\n\ndoc910358: Aslan. Aslan is first introduced in the book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which takes place one thousand years after Narnia's founding. Narnia is now in the hundredth year of the tyrannical rule of Jadis, who has returned as a powerful sorceress called the White Witch. Jadis has condemned the land to endless winter \u2013 but never Christmas \u2013 and has turned hundreds of Aslan's followers to stone.\n\ndoc2562588: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). In the magical land of Narnia, there is always winter but never Christmas due to the tyrannical rule of the White Witch. The Witch fears a prophecy which states that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will be crowned kings and queens of Narnia, ending her life. When she learns that the four Pevensie children have arrived in Narnia, she will stop at nothing to prevent them from fulfilling this prophecy. However, the Great Lion Aslan is on the move to help the four children to save Narnia.\n\ndoc325364: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. With the introduction of the quest for the seven swords, a reappearance of the White Witch, and a larger role for Eustace in dragon form, the movie adaptation attempts to appeal to Everyman and not just to Lewis fans and Christian audiences. Nonetheless, Christian reviewers found much to like. Key for many was the closing scene where Aslan assures Lucy that he is indeed in her own world, where he has another name, and that she was brought to Narnia so that she might come to know him better in her own world. This contrasts with the reception of the first two Narnia films, which Christian reviewers felt lacked key incidents and themes from the corresponding books, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian.[116][117]\n\ndoc374366: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. They filmed in the Czech Republic (Prague and National Park \u010cesk\u00e9 \u0160v\u00fdcarsko), Slovenia and Poland after the Christmas break,[5] before wrapping in February.[30]\n\ndoc1181153: The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Nikabrik tells Caspian that there is a way he can claim his throne and guarantee Miraz's death. When Caspian agrees, a hag uses black sorcery to summon the White Witch. From inside a wall of ice, the Witch tries to convince Caspian to give her a drop of his blood in order to set her free. Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin arrive and dispatch Nikabrik while Edmund shatters the wall of ice before the Witch can be freed.\n\ndoc2562590: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). The lady introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia and demands to know what Edmund is. On learning that Edmund is a son of Adam, she acts friendly towards him, even giving him a nice hot drink and Turkish delight. During their conversation, Edmund informs the Queen that he has a brother and two sisters and that Lucy had previously been to Narnia and met a faun. The Queen requests Edmund to bring his siblings to her house in Narnia, saying she will give him more Turkish delight if he does. She also makes him the offer of becoming a prince and then king of Narnia. Edmund is delighted by the Queen's offers. After the Queen leaves, Edmund finds Lucy and discovers that she has been with Mr. Tumnus, who has not been caught by the White Witch. When Lucy describes the White Witch, Edmund shockingly realises that she is none other than the woman he had just befriended - however, he does not tell Lucy of his encounter with her at this stage. Back in their own country, Lucy tells Peter and Susan that Edmund has also got into Narnia, but Edmund lies saying that he and Lucy were only pretending that Narnia existed. Peter is furious with Edmund for setting Lucy off, especially after Edmund had been treating Lucy cruelly over her 'false' stories of Narnia. Peter and Susan seek advice from Professor Kirke who is completely convinced that logically, Lucy is telling the truth. A few days pass and the four children are on the run from the Professor's housekeeper who is hosting a tour of the house. They end up hiding in the wardrobe and all find themselves in Narnia, realising that Lucy was indeed right. They go to visit Mr. Tumnus, but find his cave destroyed. They discover a note, signed by Maugrim, captain of the secret police, saying that Mr. Tumnus has been arrested for high treason against the Queen of Narnia, which includes fraternising with humans.\n\ndoc376735: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The magical land of Narnia is populated by talking animals, mythological species, and sentient flora.\n\ndoc797829: The Chronicles of Narnia. Completed in February 1954[20] and published by Bodley Head in London on 2 May 1955, the prequel The Magician's Nephew brings the reader back to the origins of Narnia where we learn how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it. Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings made by Digory's uncle. They encounter Jadis (The White Witch) in the dying world of Charn, and witness the creation of Narnia. Many long-standing questions about the world are answered as a result. The story is set in 1900, when Digory was a 12-year-old boy. He is a middle-aged professor and host to the Pevensie children by the time of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 40 years later.\n\ndoc62378: White Witch. In the BBC Radio productions of The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe[clarification needed] Jadis was played by Rosemary Martin.\n\ndoc62358: White Witch. Some recent editions of the books include brief notes, added by later editors, that describe the cast of characters. As Lewis scholar Peter Schakel points out, the description there of Jadis and the Queen of Underland (the main antagonist of The Silver Chair) \"states incorrectly that the Queen of Underland is an embodiment of Jadis\".[1] Beyond characterising the two as \"Northern Witches\", Lewis's text does not connect them. See Lady of the Green Kirtle for further discussion.\n\ndoc62373: White Witch. In The Silver Chair, 1,356 years after her death, Jadis is called one of the \"Northern Witches\", along with the Lady of the Green Kirtle - a new enemy to the good animals and humans who now inhabit Narnia. Glimfeather the Owl speculates that the Green Lady may be \"of the same crew\" as the White Witch. This has led to speculation by some readers that Jadis and the Lady of the Green Kirtle may be the same person. Lewis's text does not support this (See Lady of the Green Kirtle for further discussion). Lewis never clarifies the Green Lady's origins, or what connection she has to the White Witch. The \"Green Lady\" had first entered Narnia in serpent form and killed the wife of King Caspian, and later re-emerged in human form to lure away Caspian's son Rilian and place him under an enchantment in the underworld, only for Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole to reach the underworld with their guide, Puddleglum the marshwiggle, and rescue Rilian - who kills the Green Lady before they make their return to Narnia.\n\ndoc62383: White Witch. Swinton reprised White Witch again in the 20th Century Fox film adaptation of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, only as a manifestation of Dark Island preying on Edmund's insecurities, a mental test that Edmund overcomes as he manages to kill the Dark Island's sea serpent, a manifestation of his fear.\n\ndoc368592: Lucy Pevensie. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Lucy is the first of the Pevensies to enter Narnia through a magical wardrobe in the Professor's old house, into Narnia in the One Hundred Year Winter, under the rule of the White Witch, the evil self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia. There she meets Mr. Tumnus the Faun and, then later, the Beavers.\n\ndoc374365: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The cast and crew spent their time in New Zealand in Auckland before moving in November to the South Island. Shooting locations on the South Island included, Flock Hill in Canterbury, the area known as Elephant Rocks near Duntroon in North Otago, which was transformed into Aslan's camp.[28] The castle scene was filmed in Purakaunui Bay, in The Catlins district, not far from the most southern point in New Zealand.[29]\n\ndoc62384: White Witch. Swinton expressed interest in returning the role once more in a film adaptation of The Magician's Nephew.\n\ndoc376758: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Narnia is caught in endless winter that has lasted a century when the children first enter. Norse tradition mythologises a \"great winter,\" known as the Fimbulwinter, said to precede Ragnar\u00f6k. The trapping of Edmund by the White Witch is reminiscent of the seduction and imprisonment of Kay by The Snow Queen in Hans Christian Andersen's novella of that name.[34]\n\ndoc376760: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. There are several parallels between the White Witch and the immortal white queen, Ayesha, of H. Rider Haggard's She, a novel greatly admired by C.S. Lewis.[35]\n\ndoc139811: Jennifer Coolidge. Epic Movie, released in 2007 and made by the same people behind Date Movie, was the first movie in which she received a starring role. In the film she played the \"White Bitch\" (the White Witch) of Gnarnia (Narnia), a lampoon of the Disney and Walden Media film The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film \"irreverent and also appreciative, dragging its satiric prey down to the lowest pop-cultural denominator\" and added, \"The humor is coarse and occasionally funny. The archly bombastic score . . . is the only thing you might call witty. But happily, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard show up . . . to add some easy, demented class.\"[20]\n\ndoc910360: Aslan. Edmund, who was enchanted by the White Witch on his first visit to Narnia by eating enchanted Turkish Delight, attempts to betray his siblings and is not present to receive a gift. Mr. and Mrs. Beaver lead the others to Aslan at the Stone Table at a large gathering of Loyal Narnians preparing for war.  Aslan sends his creatures to rescue Edmund. Peter slays Maugrim the Wolf, chief of the Witch's secret police, and Aslan makes Peter a knight. He then sends his soldiers to rescue Edmund as the White Witch orders the wolf that witnessed Maugrim's death to rally her army.\n\ndoc376755: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Lewis wrote that \"The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal. Suppose there were a Narnian world and it, like ours, needed redemption. What kind of incarnation and Passion might Christ be supposed to undergo there?\"[29]\n\ndoc62361: White Witch. In The Magician's Nephew, Jadis is introduced as the Queen of Charn, a city in an entirely different world from Narnia. She was the last of a long line of kings and queens, who began well but grew evil over many generations and conquered the entire world of Charn. Jadis, a powerful sorceress, fought a bloody war of rebellion against her sister. On the point of defeat, Jadis chose not to submit, but spoke instead the Deplorable Word that destroyed all life on Charn except her own. She then cast a spell of enchanted sleep upon herself to await someone who could rescue her from Charn.\n\ndoc374364: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The filmmakers asked permission to bring in twelve reindeer to New Zealand to pull the White Witch's sled. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry denied, citing the potentially deadly Q fever from which the North American reindeer population suffers as the reason. However, ten wolves and wolf hybrids were allowed in for filming in Auckland.[27] To replace the denied live reindeer Mark Rappaport's Creature Effects, Inc. created four animatronic reindeer that were used in shots where the deer were standing in place. The reindeer were designed with replaceable skins to get the most usage; brown for Father Christmas's and white for those of the White Witch.\n\ndoc2562591: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). Lucy tells the others that the Queen is really the White Witch and convinces them to do something to save Mr. Tumnus, as she feels responsible for him being arrested. They travel on and soon encounter Mr. Beaver, who proves to be a friend by showing them a handkerchief which Lucy had given to Mr. Tumnus earlier. Mr. Beaver informs the children that Aslan is on the move - the name Aslan invokes an odd feeling in all four children. Mr. Beaver takes the children to his home. There, he and his wife Mrs. Beaver reveal that Mr. Tumnus was taken to the Witch's house and that he would have been turned into stone, as are most Narnians who go there. The children are given more information on Aslan, who is the Great Lion and the true king of Narnia who will save Mr. Tumnus. The Beavers also reveal that the children are part of a prophecy that states that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will be crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia, thus ending the reign of the White Witch - it is for this reason that the White Witch is always looking out for humans in Narnia. They all soon see that Edmund has disappeared - Mr. Beaver instantly realises that he has betrayed them to the White Witch. He is more convinced of this when he learns that Edmund had previously been to Narnia alone and not told his siblings what he had done or who he had met. The Beavers realise that the Witch will soon come after them and prepare for their journey to meet Aslan at the Stone Table. Edmund arrives at the Witch's house - the Witch is furious that he came alone and even more furious when he tells her that Aslan has come to Narnia.\n\ndoc374355: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The radio-announcer that Peter listens to on the rainy day near the beginning of the film is played by Douglas Gresham, co-producer of the movie and C. S. Lewis's stepson.[4] Keynes' voice broke during filming, so some of his voice track had to be re-looped by his sister Soumaya.[4] Mr. Pevensie is only glimpsed in a photo which Edmund tries to retrieve during the bombing, which is of Sim-Evan Jones' father.[5]\n\ndoc797823: The Chronicles of Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, completed by the end of March 1949[17] and published by Geoffrey Bles in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1950, tells the story of four ordinary children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie, who have been evacuated to the English countryside from London in 1940 following the outbreak of World War II. They discover a wardrobe in Professor Digory Kirke's house that leads to the magical land of Narnia. The Pevensie children help Aslan, a talking lion, save Narnia from the evil White Witch, who has reigned over the land of Narnia for a century of perpetual winter with no Christmas. The children become kings and queens of this new-found land and establish the Golden Age of Narnia, leaving a legacy to be rediscovered in later books.\n\ndoc556111: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1979 film). When four children Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter stumble into an old Wardrobe they find themselves in a magical land called Narnia with talking animals, fauns, hags, the Wicked White Witch and the great lion Aslan. There they meet the friendly Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them on their quest to find Aslan the great lion. Only he can help save Lucy's friend Mr. Tumnus (the faun) from the White Witch. They have a fun mysterious time there, and ultimately end up ruling as kings and queens, until they end up back home.\n\ndoc797863: The Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis's early life has parallels with The Chronicles of Narnia. At the age of seven, he moved with his family to a large house on the edge of Belfast. Its long hallways and empty rooms inspired Lewis and his brother to invent make-believe worlds whilst exploring their home, an activity reflected in Lucy's discovery of Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.[32] Like Caspian and Rilian, Lewis lost his mother at an early age, spending much of his youth in English boarding schools similar to those attended by the Pevensie children, Eustace Scrubb, and Jill Pole. During World War II many children were evacuated from London and other urban areas because of German air raids. Some of these children, including one named Lucy (Lewis's goddaughter) stayed with him at his home The Kilns near Oxford, just as the Pevensies stayed with The Professor in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.[33]\n\ndoc2440545: Mr. Tumnus. When Lucy returns to Narnia a few days later, Tumnus is still safe: evidently the White Witch hasn't discovered his disobedience.  However, Lucy's brother Edmund enters Narnia shortly afterward and mentions to the White Witch that his sister had visited Narnia before and met a faun. When Lucy and her siblings subsequently come to Narnia, they find that Tumnus has been arrested by Maugrim, Chief of the White Witch's secret police. Tumnus had spoken to Mr. Beaver of his fears not long before his arrest and asked him to guide the four children if he found them in Narnia. The children meet Mr. Beaver just after leaving Tumnus's ransacked cave.\n\ndoc374351: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Edmund sneaks off to visit the Witch. When he arrives at her castle, she is furious he has not delivered his siblings. The Witch sends wolves to track down the children and the beavers, who barely escape. Edmund is chained in the Witch's dungeon, where he meets Tumnus. The Witch demands Edmund reveal his siblings' location. After Tumnus claims that Edmund knows nothing, The Witch tells Mr. Tumnus Edmund betrayed him, then turns Tumnus to stone.\n\ndoc374358: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. During the early 1990s, producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were planning a film version.[13] They could not find a space in Britain to shoot the film during 1996,[14] and their plans to set the film in modern times[15] made Douglas Gresham oppose the film,[16] in addition to his feeling that technology had yet to catch up.[15] Perry Moore began negotiations with the C. S. Lewis Estate in 2000.[17] On December 7, 2001, Walden Media announced that they had acquired the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia.[18]\n\ndoc374354: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Fifteen years later, the Pevensie children, now young adults, chase a white stag through the forest. They encounter the lamppost Lucy saw earlier and suddenly tumble out of the wardrobe at the same time and day they left, becoming children again. Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe. Professor Kirke tells her he has tried for many years, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect it.\n\ndoc374352: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While Peter, Lucy, Susan, and the beavers travel, they hide from what they believe to be the White Witch. It is really Father Christmas, a sign that the Witch's reign is ending. Father Christmas gives them weapons to defend themselves. Lucy receives a healing cordial that can heal any injury. Susan receives a magical horn that will summon help and a bow and quiver full of arrows. Peter receives a sword. After evading wolves led by Maugrim, the group reaches Aslan's camp. Aslan is revealed as a huge and noble lion, who promises to help Edmund. Later, two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan. When Peter intervenes, Maugrim attacks him, and Peter kills him. Some of Aslan's troops follow the other wolf to the witch's camp and rescue Edmund. Peter is knighted by Aslan.\n\ndoc2193301: Mr. and Mrs. Beaver. In Prince Caspian', the black dwarf Nikabrik claims that the White Witch had eliminated beavers from Narnia. He was clearly mistaken.\n\ndoc374357: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan's voice was a contention point. Brian Cox was originally cast in the role on December 9, 2004,[10] but Adamson changed his mind.[11] Liam Neeson sought out the role,[7] and was announced as the voice on July 17, 2005.[12]\n\ndoc2562589: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are siblings who are sent to live with Professor Digory Kirke in the country side during World War 2. Whilst exploring the house one day, Lucy who is the youngest discovers a mysterious wardrobe and on entering it, finds herself in the middle of a snowy wood with a lamp post. She encounters a faun who introduces himself as Mr. Tumnus and reveals that Lucy has entered the land of Narnia. The seemingly kind faun invites Lucy to his cave for some tea and plays a tune on his flute which forces her into a deep sleep where she sees visions of what Narnia used to be like before winter. Lucy suddenly wakes up and realises she must go home but Mr. Tumnus breaks down and reveals that he is employed (albeit unwillingly) by the evil White Witch, who makes it always winter but never Christmas in Narnia. The Witch has ordered all Narnians to hand over any humans (or 'Sons of Adam' and ' Daughters of Eve' as they are known in Narnia). The faun realises he cannot hand over Lucy to the evil Witch, having understood what humans are like once he met her. He escorts her back to the lamp post and she returns back through the Wardrobe. Lucy tells her siblings of what she discovered in the wardrobe but they find nothing when they look. This, along with the fact that no time passed on Earth when Lucy entered the wardrobe, lead her siblings to believe that Lucy has been lying. A few days later, during a game of hide and seek, Lucy wonders back through the wardrobe and Edmund, the second youngest, and by far the most volatile of the four children, follows her. To Edmund's shock, he finds that Lucy was telling the truth about the country in the back of the wardrobe. Whilst looking for Lucy, Edmund comes across a sleigh transporting a lady.\n\ndoc1417327: The Witches (novel). Shortly after arriving back in England, while the boy is working on the roof of the tree-house he has been building, he sees a strange woman in black staring up at him with an eerie smile, and he realizes that she is a witch. When the witch offers him a snake to tempt him, he climbs further up the tree and stays there, not daring to come down until his grandmother comes looking for him. This persuades the boy and his grandmother to be especially wary; and he carefully scrutinizes all women to determine whether or not they might be witches.\n\ndoc1985122: Land of Oz. White is the traditional color of witches in Oz. The Good Witch of the North wears a pointed white hat and a white gown decorated with stars, while Glinda, the Good Witch of the South (called a \"sorceress\" in later books), wears a pure white dress. Dorothy is taken for a witch not only because she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East, but because her dress is blue and white checked.[31]\n\ndoc374361: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Weta Workshop head Richard Taylor cited Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights as an inspiration on the film. He felt Narnia had to be less dark and gritty than their depiction of Middle-earth in The Lord of the Rings because it is a new world.[22] Many of Weta's creature designs were designed for digital creation, so when Howard Berger and KNB FX inherited the practical effects work, they had to spend three months retooling approved designs for animatronics.[23] Berger's children would comment and advise upon his designs; they suggested the White Witch's hair be changed from black to blonde, which Berger concurred with as he realized Swinton's wig looked too Gothic.[24]\n\ndoc797908: The Chronicles of Narnia. The Royal Shakespeare Company premiered The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1998. The novel was adapted as a musical production by Adrian Mitchell, with music by Shaun Davey.[91] The show was originally directed by Adrian Noble and designed by Anthony Ward, with the revival directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace. Well received by audiences, the production was periodically re-staged by the RSC for several years afterwards.[92] Limited engagements were subsequently undertaken at the Barbican Theatre in London and at Sadler's Wells. This adaptation also toured the United States in the early 2000s.\n\ndoc376719: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. During a game of hide-and-seek on some days later, Lucy again passes into Narnia. This time her brother Edmund chances to follow her. He meets Jadis, who calls herself Queen of Narnia. When she learns that he is human and has two sisters and a brother, she places an enchantment on him. She urges him to bring his siblings to her castle, promising in return to make him her heir. When Lucy and Edmund return together through the wardrobe, Edmund realizes that the queen he met and the witch Lucy describes are one and the same. He denies to the others that he has been in Narnia at all. Peter and Susan are puzzled by Lucy's insistence, and consult the Professor, who surprises them by taking Lucy's side in the debate of Narnia's existence.\n\ndoc337974: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game). A significant feature has William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Anna Popplewell, Georgie Henley, Elizabeth Hawthorne, and Jim Broadbent reprising their roles from the film.\n\ndoc62369: White Witch. Jadis insists on her right as the first to rebel against Aslan to take the life of Edmund as a traitor. She accepts Aslan's offer of his own life as substitute, knowing that without him the Pevensies cannot stand against her - even with the support of Aslan's army - although this pact is kept a secret from Aslan's followers. At the Stone Table, she and her followers bind Aslan and humiliate him, and Jadis kills him with a stone knife. Susan and Lucy witness the killing from nearby bushes after following Aslan from their encampment.\n\ndoc513340: Maugrim. Maugrim is a fictional character in the novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis. A Narnian wolf, he is Captain of the White Witch's Secret Police. In early American editions of the book, Lewis changed the name to Fenris Ulf (a wolf from Norse mythology), but when HarperCollins took over the books they took out Lewis' revisions,[1] and the name Maugrim has been used in all editions since 1994.[2]\n\ndoc797906: The Chronicles of Narnia. In 1984, Vanessa Ford Productions presented The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe at London's Westminster Theatre. Adapted by Glyn Robbins, the play was directed by Richard Williams and designed by Marty Flood. The production was later revived at Westminster and The Royalty Theatre and went on tour until 1997. Productions of other tales from The Chronicles were also staged, including The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1986), The Magician's Nephew (1988) and The Horse and His Boy (1990).\n\ndoc374380: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. For the song \"Can't Take It In\"\n\ndoc376751: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Lewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis's publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.[21]\n\ndoc1369961: Susan Pevensie. Susan Pevensie is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia series. Susan is the elder sister and the second eldest Pevensie child. She appears in three of the seven books\u00e2\u20ac\u201das a child in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian, and as an adult in The Horse and His Boy. She is also mentioned in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Last Battle. During her reign at the Narnian capital of Cair Paravel, she is known as Queen Susan the Gentle or Queen Susan of the Horn. She was the only Pevensie that survived the train wreck (because she was not on the train or at the station) on Earth which sent the others to Narnia after The Last Battle.[2]\n\ndoc374347: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. During World War II, the Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are evacuated from a London suburb to Professor Digory Kirke's country home. Mrs Macready, the strict housekeeper, explains he is unaccustomed to hosting children.\n\ndoc62371: White Witch. In Prince Caspian, 1,300 years after her death, Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines, a human race who believe they have wiped out Narnia's population of talking animals. Since the fight to expel the Telmarines is going badly, a black dwarf (Nikabrik), a hag, and a wer-wolf (to use Lewis's spelling) plan to resurrect Jadis to fight against the Telmarines, as they consider her a lesser evil than the current ruler, King Miraz, whose ancestors had invaded Narnia and believed that they had wiped out the talking animals, and forbade any mention of their existence or the existence of Aslan. However, talking animals continued to live in hiding in isolated parts of Narnia, and are eventually discovered by Prince Caspian after he flees his Uncle Miraz's castle. They join his side, but Nikabrik, the hag and the were-wolf will stop at nothing to oust Miraz, despite Caspian's warnings that the Witch was \"a hundred times worse than Miraz himself\" - they are then killed in a melee which involves Caspian, his tutor Dr Cornelius, and the returning Peter and Edmund, who have been recalled to Narnia after Caspian blows Susan's horn. On the orders of Aslan and the newly-crowned King Caspian, Narnia is now a land in which humans and talking animals are encouraged to integrate and have equal rights - although a small number of Telmarines accept Aslan's offer of building a new life for themselves on Planet Earth, on the Pacific island where their pirate descendants had entered Narnia through a cave in the early 1940s.\n\ndoc376723: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Meanwhile, Mr Beaver realises that Edmund has betrayed them, and they set off at once to seek Aslan at the Stone Table. As they travel, the Witch's spell over Narnia begins to break: Father Christmas (who has not been seen in Narnia for a hundred years) arrives with magical presents: a sword for Peter, a horn and a bow with arrows for Susan, a knife and a bottle of healing cordial for Lucy. The snow melts, and winter ends. Aslan welcomes the children and the Beavers to his camp near the Stone Table. Upon hearing Edmund's situation, he orders a rescue party of loyal Narnians.\n\ndoc73653: The Chronicles of Narnia (film series). The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, based on the novel of the same title, is the first film in the series. Directed by Andrew Adamson, it was shot mainly in New Zealand, though locations were used in Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom.\n\ndoc910359: Aslan. He is first mentioned by Mr. Beaver, who tells the Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) that \"Aslan is on the move\". He explains that Aslan is the true king of Narnia and that the children (as Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve) are the chosen ones to help end the tyrannical rule of the White Witch. Even as the children explore Narnia, Aslan's presence begins to weaken Jadis' grip on the land; the ice begins to melt and Father Christmas appears at last and gives the children gifts.\n\ndoc644998: Anna Popplewell. Her first major role was in the film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) where she played Susan Pevensie. She has a phobia of mice, which required a double to do part of her scene at the Stone Table in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.[2] She reprised her role in the sequel, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, in which she acted with William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley and Ben Barnes. The film opened in cinemas 16 May 2008. She also made a cameo appearance in the third Narnia film, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.\n\ndoc374362: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Principal photography began in New Zealand on June 28, 2004,[25] shooting in primarily chronological order.[5] Adamson did this in order to naturally create a sense of mature development from his young actors, which mirrored their real life development.[16] Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes[7] were never shown the set before filming scenes of their characters entering Narnia, nor had Henley seen James McAvoy in his Mr. Tumnus costume before shooting their scenes together.[4]\n\ndoc374367: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The soundtrack was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams. Gregson-Williams had previously worked with Adamson on Shrek (2001) and Shrek 2 (2004). In addition there are three original songs in the film; Can't Take It In by Imogen Heap, Wunderkind by Alanis Morissette and Winter Light by Tim Finn. Evanescence lead singer Amy Lee also wrote a song for the film, but it was not included in the soundtrack.[31]\n\ndoc62385: White Witch. Jadis appears in the Neil Gaiman short story \"The Problem of Susan\" which appeared in the collection \"Fragile Things\".\n\ndoc337977: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game). The player can also collect coins, which may be traded in for special moves and character upgrades, such as an increase in health.[5] The player may also mark statues of petrified heroes for Aslan to restore; this directly affects the amount of reinforcements that the player will have in the final battle against the White Witch.[4] Other bonus items can be found and collected throughout the game.[5]\n\ndoc2440544: Mr. Tumnus. Tumnus first appears when Lucy arrives in Narnia at the lamp-post. He invites her back to his cave for tea, during which, they talk about Narnia. Tumnus then plays  his flute, and Lucy falls asleep. When Lucy wakes up, she sees him in tears. He confesses that he is in the pay of the White Witch (Jadis), who rules Narnia and has made it always winter but never Christmas. She had ordered him and the other Narnians to hand over any Sons of Adam or Daughters of Eve - humans - that he sees in Narnia. Tumnus, despite knowing that the Witch will find out if he disobeys her orders, quickly realises that he can't bear to give Lucy up to the Witch, so he guides her back to the lamp-post to see that she returns safely to her own world.\n\ndoc797879: The Chronicles of Narnia. J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, has said that she was a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the influence of The Chronicles on her work: \"I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross Station\u00a0\u2014 it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts.\"[52] Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: \"Narnia is literally a different world\", she says, \"whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal.\"[52] New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until he is redeemed by Aslan.[53]\n\ndoc376729: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Fifteen years later, the four rulers chase a wish-granting white stag through the forest whereupon they rediscover the lamppost. They soon find their way not through branches but coats. They come back through the wardrobe in the Professor's house and are suddenly children again, dressed in their old clothes. Almost no time has passed in the real world, despite their many years in Narnia.\n\ndoc797907: The Chronicles of Narnia. In 1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre and musical production company, produced a musical rendition of \"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" that Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film adaptations), has openly declared that he feels is the closest to Lewis's intent. The book and lyrics were written by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Inocian, while the music was composed by Lito Villareal.[89][90]\n\ndoc325325: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. At another island, Lucy is abducted by the invisible Dufflepuds, who force her to enter the manor of the magician Coriakin to find a visibility spell. She does so, and later introduces him to her friends. Coriakin encourages the crew to defeat the mist by laying the lords' seven swords at Aslan's Table on Ramandu's island, but warns them that they are about to be tested, through temptation. Lucy recites a beauty incantation she found, and enters a dream in which she has transformed into Susan and neither Lucy nor Narnia exist. Aslan chides Lucy for her self-doubt, explaining that her siblings only know of Narnia because of her, telling her \"don't run away from who you are\".\n\ndoc62375: White Witch. A natural-born sorceress and a cunning strategist, Jadis is arrogant and cruel, considering herself above all rules and viewing others as tools to be used or obstacles to be demolished. After she eats the Fruit of Everlasting Life, selfishly and against the written admonition on the gate, she discovers that her sense of inner power and life is amplified. Her callousness and sense of entitlement is most clearly demonstrated when she uses the Deplorable Word in Charn to vanquish her sister, even though the Word would eradicate all life in that world but her own. She prefers to destroy that entire world than submit to her sister's authority, and shows afterward a remorseless pride in her actions.\n\ndoc376728: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Meanwhile, Peter and Edmund lead the Narnians against Jadis, and Edmund is seriously wounded. Aslan arrives with the former statues as reinforcements. The Narnians rout Jadis's supporters, and Aslan kills Jadis. Aslan breathes life into those Jadis has turned to stone on the battlefield, and Lucy uses her magic cordial to revive the wounded, starting with Edmund. The Pevensie children are crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel. Soon afterward, Aslan slips away and disappears.\n\ndoc797853: The Chronicles of Narnia. Tumnus is a faun who is featured prominently in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and also appears in The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle. He is close friends with Lucy and is the first creature she meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series. Lewis said that the first Narnia story came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood. In that way, Tumnus was the initial inspiration for the entire Narnia series.[29]\n\ndoc62377: White Witch. The voice of Jadis was provided by Elizabeth Counsell in Focus on the Family's radio drama versions of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Magician's Nephew. Counsell also made a cameo appearance as a lamb in The Last Battle.\n\ndoc374363: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The first scene shot was at the former RNZAF Base Hobsonville for the railway scene.[26] Afterwards, they shot the Blitz scene, which Adamson called their first formal day of shooting.[8]\n\ndoc910365: Aslan. The novel Prince Caspian takes place 1,300 Narnian years after the events in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan and the Pevensie children have become near-forgotten \"myths\", and Narnia is now ruled by Telmarines, humans who have since conquered and settled in Narnia.\n\ndoc797857: The Chronicles of Narnia. The main setting of The Chronicles of Narnia is the world of Narnia constructed by Lewis and, in The Magician's Nephew, the world containing the city of Charn. The Narnian and Charnian worlds are themselves posited as just two in a multiverse of countless worlds that includes our own universe, the main protagonists' world of origin. Passage between these worlds is possible, though rare, and may be accomplished by various means. Narnia itself is described as populated by a wide variety of creatures, most of which would be recognisable to those familiar with European mythologies and British and Irish fairy tales.\n\n"

Meanwhile, the land of Narnia remains the domain of animals (chosen animals are given the ability to speak, and become pillars of society) and is not troubled by the Witch nor any other enemy for many hundred years.\n\ndoc797849: The Chronicles of Narnia. Jadis, commonly known during her rule of Narnia as the White Witch, is the main antagonist of The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. She is the witch responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting in the Hundred Year Winter. The White Witch was born in the world of Charn, before the creation of Narnia, and died in battle in Narnian year 1000.\n\ndoc62362: White Witch. Many years later, a 12-year-old Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer arrive in the ruins of Charn through Digory's uncle's magic. The children find the bell that Jadis left to break the spell. Despite Polly's warning not to ring the bell, Digory does so. Jadis is awakened and by holding on to them is transported with them back to London in the year 1900. She initially aims to conquer the world to which she is transported, but finds that her magic does not work there. Digory, seeking to correct his mistake, attempts to transport her back to Charn, but they end up instead in the world of Narnia at the moment of its creation by the lion Aslan. As Aslan approaches, she attacks him with the rod of iron she has torn by main strength from a London lamp post; but when this has no effect, she flees.\n\ndoc62366: White Witch. She styles herself \"Her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands\", and she casts Narnia into an endless winter with no Christmas. She fears a prophecy that four humans, two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve, will cause her downfall, and orders all Narnians - including those who might oppose her - to bring any human they come across to her.\n\ndoc62363: White Witch. Jadis makes her way to the garden on a mountain west of Narnia, where she eats an apple that she believes will make her immortal and give her eternal life. However, this supposed immortality comes at a cost: her skin is bleached white, and the evil in her heart causes her eternal misery. She cannot stand the sight of the tree that Aslan has Digory plant in Narnia from the fruit of the garden, and she thus stays to the north of Narnia, working to develop her magic.\n\ndoc62379: White Witch. In the 2005 Walt Disney Pictures feature film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, she was portrayed by British actress Tilda Swinton. Swinton's performance won particular acclaim among fans and critics. BBC film critic Stella Papamichael wrote:[3]\n\ndoc62367: White Witch. By the time the Pevensie children arrive in Narnia, Jadis has ruled for 100 years. She first meets Edmund Pevensie, enchants him with magical Turkish delight, and tempts him to betray his siblings by offering to make him her heir and bring them to Narnia with him, although at this stage only Edmund and his sister Lucy have been in Narnia. The four Pevensie children all arrive in Narnia together soon afterwards, and Edmund strays to the Witch after he and the other children are taken in by Mr and Mrs Beaver. He had realised that the \"Queen of Narnia\" (as she had introduced herself) and the White Witch were one and the same after a conversation with Lucy, but was still determined to taste more Turkish Delight and remained convinced that the Witch would deliver her promise to make him heir to her throne.\n\ndoc62365: White Witch. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, set 1,000 Narnian years after the events of The Magician's Nephew, Jadis has usurped power over Narnia after the tree that kept her at bay had died. Now known as the White Witch, she is served by various races including Wolves (who make up her secret police), Black Dwarves, Giants, Werewolves, Tree Spirits that are on her side, Ghouls, Boggles, Ogres, Minotaurs, Cruels, Hags, Spectres, People of the Toadstools, Incubi, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Orknies, Sprites, Wooses, Ettins, Poisonous Plant Spirits, Evil Apes, Giant Bats, Vultures, and creatures that according to C. S. Lewis are \"so horrible that if I told you, your parents probably wouldn't let you read this book.\" Her magic is now powerful, and she has acquired a wand with which she can turn enemies to stone if they displease or attempt to challenge her in any way.\n\ndoc62357: White Witch. Jadis is the main antagonist of The Magician's Nephew and of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in C. S. Lewis's series, The Chronicles of Narnia. She is commonly referred to as the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, as she is the Witch who froze Narnia in the Hundred Years Winter.\n\ndoc62382: White Witch. Swinton reprised her role as the White Witch in the 2008 Disney Movie sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. In a departure from the novel, Nikabrik and his fellow conspirators manage to conjure an apparition of Jadis within a mystical wall of ice and attempt to offer her Caspian X as she needs a drop of blood from a son of Adam to fully resurrect herself. She tries to coax Caspian into offering her his blood and then from Peter, promising to lend her powers to their fight against King Miraz once she is made whole. However, Edmund shatters the ice before the Witch can obtain a drop of blood, and the apparition vanishes.\n\ndoc62368: White Witch. But with the approach of Aslan, her magical winter thaws, and Edmund is rescued after his treason. He had been greeted with a hostile reception from the White Witch after arriving at her castle alone, and even more so after informing her that Aslan had come to Narnia. The harshness of the Witch's winter had made Edmund realise that he had been wrong in thinking that her side was the right side to be on, and he realised the full extent of her evil when he witnessed her turning a party of creatures into stone after their revelation that Father Christmas had been in Narnia - much to the Witch's horror after she had banished him.\n\ndoc62360: White Witch. (This reference to Lilith is a tribute to the fantasy novel with this title by George MacDonald, a literary hero of C.S. Lewis.) Jadis died in battle in Narnian year 1000, meaning that she lived for well over 1,000 years.\n\ndoc62370: White Witch. She is unaware, however, that due to a deeper magic from before Narnia's founding, that Aslan's life will be restored as he was an innocent, willing victim who had offered his life in a traitor's stead. Aslan then reaches her castle and restores all her statues to life, and brings them as reinforcements to the battle at Beruna against the witch's army. Her army is defeated, and Aslan himself kills Jadis, while most of her followers are killed and the remnants of her army flee and are eventually killed by Aslan's followers, who now serve Narnia under their new rulers.\n\ndoc62359: White Witch. Jadis was born on an unknown date long before the creation of Narnia. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe she is identified as a descendant of Adam's first wife (Lilith) and the giants:\n\ndoc337981: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game). The fantasy land of Narnia has been under the spell of the evil White Witch, who makes it always winter but never Christmas, but when Aslan comes, it will be spring again and the Witch's reign will be over. Four children enter Narnia and, along with the legendary lion, Aslan, help defeat the White Witch and her evil minions.(This version is based on the 2005 film.)\n\ndoc374344: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a 2005 British-American high fantasy film directed by Andrew Adamson and based on The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the first published and second chronological novel in C. S. Lewis's children's epic fantasy series, The Chronicles of Narnia. It was co-produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures. William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley play Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, four British children evacuated during the Blitz to the countryside, who find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There they ally with the Lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) against the forces of Jadis, the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).\n\ndoc73647: The Chronicles of Narnia (film series). The series revolves around the adventures of children in the world of Narnia, guided by Aslan, a wise and powerful lion that can speak and is the true king of Narnia. The children heavily featured in the films are the Pevensie siblings, and a prominent antagonist is the White Witch (also known as Jadis).\n\ndoc374349: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. One night, Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, entering Narnia. After searching for Lucy, meets the White Witch, who claims to be queen. She offers him Turkish Delight and the prospect of becoming king if he brings his siblings to her castle. After she departs, Edmund and Lucy meet again and return. Lucy tells Peter and Susan what happened, but Edmund lies. Professor Kirke suggests she is telling the truth, though they remain unconvinced.\n\ndoc376717: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. In 1940, four siblings \u2013 Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie \u2013 are among many children evacuated from London during World War II to escape the Blitz. They are sent to the countryside to live with professor Digory Kirke. Exploring the professor's house, Lucy finds a wardrobe which doubles as a magic portal to a forest in a land called Narnia. At a lamppost oddly located in the forest, she meets Tumnus, a faun, who invites her to tea in his home. There the faun confesses that he invited her not out of hospitality, but with the intention of betraying her to the White Witch. The witch has ruled Narnia for years, using magic to keep it frozen in a perpetual winter. She has ordered all Narnians to turn in any humans (\"Sons of Adam\" or \"Daughters of Eve\") they come across. But now that he has come to know and like a human, Tumnus repents his original intention and escorts Lucy back to the lamppost.\n\ndoc374350: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While running away from Mrs. Macready after accidentally breaking a window, the four siblings retreat to the wardrobe and enter Narnia. They discover the Witch has taken Mr. Tumnus, and they meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who tell them about Aslan. According to the beavers, Aslan intends to take control of Narnia from the Witch. The four must help Aslan; it has been prophesied that if two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit in the four thrones, the White Witch's reign will end.\n\ndoc73654: The Chronicles of Narnia (film series). The story follows the four British Pevensie siblings, who are evacuated during the Blitz to the countryside, where they find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There, they must ally with the lion Aslan against the forces of the White Witch, who has placed Narnia in an eternal winter.\n\ndoc797878: The Chronicles of Narnia. Lev Grossman's New York Times best-seller The Magicians is a contemporary dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the magical land of his favourite childhood books. Fillory is a thinly veiled substitute for Narnia, and clearly the author expects it to be experienced as such. Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock in the home of an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II. Moreover, the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised by The Watcherwoman. She, like the White Witch, freezes the land in time. The book's plot revolves heavily around a place very like the \"wood between the worlds\" from The Magician's Nephew, an interworld waystation in which pools of water lead to other lands. This reference to The Magician's Nephew is echoed in the title of the book.[51]\n\ndoc374356: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. With the exception of Tilda Swinton, who was the first choice to play Jadis, the White Witch,[6] casting was a long process. Beginning in 2002,[7] Adamson went through 2500 audition tapes, met 1800 children and workshopped 400 before coming down to the final four actors for the Pevensies. Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting, whilst Henley and Keynes were cast relatively late.[8] Moseley was cast because casting director Pippa Hall remembered she cast him as an extra in Cider with Rosie (1998). He beat 3000 boys to the role of Peter and quit school to learn all his lines.[9]\n\ndoc376720: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Soon afterward, all four children enter Narnia together after hiding in the wardrobe to avoid the professor's dour housekeeper, Mrs. Macready. Remembering the winter cold ahead, they take coats from the wardrobe before exploring. Lucy guides them to Tumnus's cave, but they find it ransacked, with a notice from Jadis (the White Witch) proclaiming his arrest for harbouring humans.\n\ndoc62376: White Witch. Though her magic disappears when she leaves Charn, she manages to build it up again in Narnia's world, exercising both her previous experience and her privilege to witness a new world's dawning, to become again a sorceress of formidable power. In her own dominion, Charn, Jadis is extremely powerful; but she finds her magic largely useless in other worlds. She eventually strengthens her powers and usurps the throne of Narnia, using her magic to cast the land into perpetual winter. Her most feared weapon is her wand, whose magic is capable of turning people into stone. The petrified remains of her enemies decorate the halls of her castle. Her other powers, which she immediately loses after entering another world, include the ability to disintegrate objects and individuals, read minds, control the minds of animals (She does possibly retain or regain this power in Narnia) and the terrifying power of the Deplorable Word - the latter of which wipes out every living thing on a planet except for the speaker. For the brief period of time that Jadis is on Earth, she is shown to have no magical power, but to retain her phenomenal strength. This is demonstrated when she battles with Metropolitan Police in London, wielding the cross-bar she wrenched from a lamp post. The same cross-bar was taken into the new world that would become Narnia, and grew into the full lamp post encountered by Lucy Pevensie many years later.\n\ndoc62374: White Witch. An extraordinarily beautiful, tall and imposing woman, Jadis enchants Digory Kirke, Andrew Ketterley and Edmund Pevensie on first encounters. She is seven feet tall, as were all members of the Royal Family of Charn. After eating the fruit of eternal life, her skin becomes as white as paper.\n\ndoc374348: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While the Pevensies play hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a wardrobe and enters the fantasy world called Narnia. Seeing a lamppost, Lucy encounters the faun Mr. Tumnus, who invites her to his home. He puts Lucy to sleep by playing a lullaby on his flute. When Lucy wakes up, she finds Tumnus grieving. He explains that Jadis, the White Witch, has cursed Narnia to a hundred years of winter. If a human is encountered, they are to be brought to her. Tumnus cannot bring himself to kidnap Lucy, so he sends her home. When she returns to Professor Kirke's house, hardly any time has passed, and her siblings disbelieve her story.\n\ndoc910362: Aslan. With her greatest adversary dead, the White Witch leaves with her army to prepare for war against the Narnians, convinced that she will win. Lucy, Susan, and a number of mice remove the bonds from Aslan's body; but as the Stone Table breaks they find that his body is gone. To their shock, Aslan reappears alive and well, thanks to a Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time. The Witch, having entered Narnia only at the Dawn of Time, had not known of this. Aslan explains that the Deeper Magic is invoked when an innocent willingly offers his life in place of a traitor's, causing death itself to be reversed until the victim is reborn.\n\ndoc374353: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The White Witch journeys to Aslan's camp and claims Edmund, but Aslan secretly offers to sacrifice himself instead. That night, as Lucy and Susan covertly watch, the White Witch fatally stabs Aslan. In the morning, he is resurrected, citing magic beyond the Witch's understanding. Aslan takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle, where he frees the prisoners she turned to stone. Edmund persuades Peter to lead Aslan's army. While saving Peter from the Witch, Edmund is mortally wounded. As the Witch fights Peter, Aslan arrives with reinforcements and kills her. After Edmund is revived by Lucy's cordial, the Pevensies are crowned King Peter the Magnificent, Queen Susan the Gentle, King Edmund the Just, and Queen Lucy the Valiant.\n\ndoc376716: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Most of the novel is set in Narnia, a land of talking animals and mythical creatures that one White Witch has ruled for 100 years of deep winter. In the frame story, four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a wartime evacuation. The youngest visits Narnia three times via the magic of a wardrobe in a spare room. All four children are together on her third visit, which verifies her fantastic claims and comprises the subsequent 12 of 17 chapters except for a brief conclusion. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfill an old prophecy and so are soon adventuring both to save Narnia and their lives. Lewis wrote the book for, and dedicated it to, his goddaughter Lucy Barfield. She was the daughter of Owen Barfield, Lewis's friend, teacher, adviser, and trustee.[4]\n\ndoc797841: The Chronicles of Narnia. Echoing the Christian theme of betrayal, repentance, and subsequent redemption via blood sacrifice, Edmund betrays his siblings to Jadis, the White Witch, but quickly realises the true nature of the witch and her evil intentions towards his siblings, and joins Aslan's side. At that point he is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan's life and he joins the fight against the White Witch. Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan, and of all the human characters who visit Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most.\n\ndoc910358: Aslan. Aslan is first introduced in the book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which takes place one thousand years after Narnia's founding. Narnia is now in the hundredth year of the tyrannical rule of Jadis, who has returned as a powerful sorceress called the White Witch. Jadis has condemned the land to endless winter \u2013 but never Christmas \u2013 and has turned hundreds of Aslan's followers to stone.\n\ndoc2562588: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). In the magical land of Narnia, there is always winter but never Christmas due to the tyrannical rule of the White Witch. The Witch fears a prophecy which states that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will be crowned kings and queens of Narnia, ending her life. When she learns that the four Pevensie children have arrived in Narnia, she will stop at nothing to prevent them from fulfilling this prophecy. However, the Great Lion Aslan is on the move to help the four children to save Narnia.\n\ndoc325364: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. With the introduction of the quest for the seven swords, a reappearance of the White Witch, and a larger role for Eustace in dragon form, the movie adaptation attempts to appeal to Everyman and not just to Lewis fans and Christian audiences. Nonetheless, Christian reviewers found much to like. Key for many was the closing scene where Aslan assures Lucy that he is indeed in her own world, where he has another name, and that she was brought to Narnia so that she might come to know him better in her own world. This contrasts with the reception of the first two Narnia films, which Christian reviewers felt lacked key incidents and themes from the corresponding books, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian.[116][117]\n\ndoc374366: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. They filmed in the Czech Republic (Prague and National Park \u010cesk\u00e9 \u0160v\u00fdcarsko), Slovenia and Poland after the Christmas break,[5] before wrapping in February.[30]\n\ndoc1181153: The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Nikabrik tells Caspian that there is a way he can claim his throne and guarantee Miraz's death. When Caspian agrees, a hag uses black sorcery to summon the White Witch. From inside a wall of ice, the Witch tries to convince Caspian to give her a drop of his blood in order to set her free. Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin arrive and dispatch Nikabrik while Edmund shatters the wall of ice before the Witch can be freed.\n\ndoc2562590: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). The lady introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia and demands to know what Edmund is. On learning that Edmund is a son of Adam, she acts friendly towards him, even giving him a nice hot drink and Turkish delight. During their conversation, Edmund informs the Queen that he has a brother and two sisters and that Lucy had previously been to Narnia and met a faun. The Queen requests Edmund to bring his siblings to her house in Narnia, saying she will give him more Turkish delight if he does. She also makes him the offer of becoming a prince and then king of Narnia. Edmund is delighted by the Queen's offers. After the Queen leaves, Edmund finds Lucy and discovers that she has been with Mr. Tumnus, who has not been caught by the White Witch. When Lucy describes the White Witch, Edmund shockingly realises that she is none other than the woman he had just befriended - however, he does not tell Lucy of his encounter with her at this stage. Back in their own country, Lucy tells Peter and Susan that Edmund has also got into Narnia, but Edmund lies saying that he and Lucy were only pretending that Narnia existed. Peter is furious with Edmund for setting Lucy off, especially after Edmund had been treating Lucy cruelly over her 'false' stories of Narnia. Peter and Susan seek advice from Professor Kirke who is completely convinced that logically, Lucy is telling the truth. A few days pass and the four children are on the run from the Professor's housekeeper who is hosting a tour of the house. They end up hiding in the wardrobe and all find themselves in Narnia, realising that Lucy was indeed right. They go to visit Mr. Tumnus, but find his cave destroyed. They discover a note, signed by Maugrim, captain of the secret police, saying that Mr. Tumnus has been arrested for high treason against the Queen of Narnia, which includes fraternising with humans.\n\ndoc376735: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The magical land of Narnia is populated by talking animals, mythological species, and sentient flora.\n\ndoc797829: The Chronicles of Narnia. Completed in February 1954[20] and published by Bodley Head in London on 2 May 1955, the prequel The Magician's Nephew brings the reader back to the origins of Narnia where we learn how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it. Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings made by Digory's uncle. They encounter Jadis (The White Witch) in the dying world of Charn, and witness the creation of Narnia. Many long-standing questions about the world are answered as a result. The story is set in 1900, when Digory was a 12-year-old boy. He is a middle-aged professor and host to the Pevensie children by the time of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 40 years later.\n\ndoc62378: White Witch. In the BBC Radio productions of The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe[clarification needed] Jadis was played by Rosemary Martin.\n\ndoc62358: White Witch. Some recent editions of the books include brief notes, added by later editors, that describe the cast of characters. As Lewis scholar Peter Schakel points out, the description there of Jadis and the Queen of Underland (the main antagonist of The Silver Chair) \"states incorrectly that the Queen of Underland is an embodiment of Jadis\".[1] Beyond characterising the two as \"Northern Witches\", Lewis's text does not connect them. See Lady of the Green Kirtle for further discussion.\n\ndoc62373: White Witch. In The Silver Chair, 1,356 years after her death, Jadis is called one of the \"Northern Witches\", along with the Lady of the Green Kirtle - a new enemy to the good animals and humans who now inhabit Narnia. Glimfeather the Owl speculates that the Green Lady may be \"of the same crew\" as the White Witch. This has led to speculation by some readers that Jadis and the Lady of the Green Kirtle may be the same person. Lewis's text does not support this (See Lady of the Green Kirtle for further discussion). Lewis never clarifies the Green Lady's origins, or what connection she has to the White Witch. The \"Green Lady\" had first entered Narnia in serpent form and killed the wife of King Caspian, and later re-emerged in human form to lure away Caspian's son Rilian and place him under an enchantment in the underworld, only for Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole to reach the underworld with their guide, Puddleglum the marshwiggle, and rescue Rilian - who kills the Green Lady before they make their return to Narnia.\n\ndoc62383: White Witch. Swinton reprised White Witch again in the 20th Century Fox film adaptation of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, only as a manifestation of Dark Island preying on Edmund's insecurities, a mental test that Edmund overcomes as he manages to kill the Dark Island's sea serpent, a manifestation of his fear.\n\ndoc368592: Lucy Pevensie. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Lucy is the first of the Pevensies to enter Narnia through a magical wardrobe in the Professor's old house, into Narnia in the One Hundred Year Winter, under the rule of the White Witch, the evil self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia. There she meets Mr. Tumnus the Faun and, then later, the Beavers.\n\ndoc374365: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The cast and crew spent their time in New Zealand in Auckland before moving in November to the South Island. Shooting locations on the South Island included, Flock Hill in Canterbury, the area known as Elephant Rocks near Duntroon in North Otago, which was transformed into Aslan's camp.[28] The castle scene was filmed in Purakaunui Bay, in The Catlins district, not far from the most southern point in New Zealand.[29]\n\ndoc62384: White Witch. Swinton expressed interest in returning the role once more in a film adaptation of The Magician's Nephew.\n\ndoc376758: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Narnia is caught in endless winter that has lasted a century when the children first enter. Norse tradition mythologises a \"great winter,\" known as the Fimbulwinter, said to precede Ragnar\u00f6k. The trapping of Edmund by the White Witch is reminiscent of the seduction and imprisonment of Kay by The Snow Queen in Hans Christian Andersen's novella of that name.[34]\n\ndoc376760: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. There are several parallels between the White Witch and the immortal white queen, Ayesha, of H. Rider Haggard's She, a novel greatly admired by C.S. Lewis.[35]\n\ndoc139811: Jennifer Coolidge. Epic Movie, released in 2007 and made by the same people behind Date Movie, was the first movie in which she received a starring role. In the film she played the \"White Bitch\" (the White Witch) of Gnarnia (Narnia), a lampoon of the Disney and Walden Media film The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film \"irreverent and also appreciative, dragging its satiric prey down to the lowest pop-cultural denominator\" and added, \"The humor is coarse and occasionally funny. The archly bombastic score . . . is the only thing you might call witty. But happily, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard show up . . . to add some easy, demented class.\"[20]\n\ndoc910360: Aslan. Edmund, who was enchanted by the White Witch on his first visit to Narnia by eating enchanted Turkish Delight, attempts to betray his siblings and is not present to receive a gift. Mr. and Mrs. Beaver lead the others to Aslan at the Stone Table at a large gathering of Loyal Narnians preparing for war.  Aslan sends his creatures to rescue Edmund. Peter slays Maugrim the Wolf, chief of the Witch's secret police, and Aslan makes Peter a knight. He then sends his soldiers to rescue Edmund as the White Witch orders the wolf that witnessed Maugrim's death to rally her army.\n\ndoc376755: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Lewis wrote that \"The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal. Suppose there were a Narnian world and it, like ours, needed redemption. What kind of incarnation and Passion might Christ be supposed to undergo there?\"[29]\n\ndoc62361: White Witch. In The Magician's Nephew, Jadis is introduced as the Queen of Charn, a city in an entirely different world from Narnia. She was the last of a long line of kings and queens, who began well but grew evil over many generations and conquered the entire world of Charn. Jadis, a powerful sorceress, fought a bloody war of rebellion against her sister. On the point of defeat, Jadis chose not to submit, but spoke instead the Deplorable Word that destroyed all life on Charn except her own. She then cast a spell of enchanted sleep upon herself to await someone who could rescue her from Charn.\n\ndoc374364: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The filmmakers asked permission to bring in twelve reindeer to New Zealand to pull the White Witch's sled. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry denied, citing the potentially deadly Q fever from which the North American reindeer population suffers as the reason. However, ten wolves and wolf hybrids were allowed in for filming in Auckland.[27] To replace the denied live reindeer Mark Rappaport's Creature Effects, Inc. created four animatronic reindeer that were used in shots where the deer were standing in place. The reindeer were designed with replaceable skins to get the most usage; brown for Father Christmas's and white for those of the White Witch.\n\ndoc2562591: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). Lucy tells the others that the Queen is really the White Witch and convinces them to do something to save Mr. Tumnus, as she feels responsible for him being arrested. They travel on and soon encounter Mr. Beaver, who proves to be a friend by showing them a handkerchief which Lucy had given to Mr. Tumnus earlier. Mr. Beaver informs the children that Aslan is on the move - the name Aslan invokes an odd feeling in all four children. Mr. Beaver takes the children to his home. There, he and his wife Mrs. Beaver reveal that Mr. Tumnus was taken to the Witch's house and that he would have been turned into stone, as are most Narnians who go there. The children are given more information on Aslan, who is the Great Lion and the true king of Narnia who will save Mr. Tumnus. The Beavers also reveal that the children are part of a prophecy that states that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will be crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia, thus ending the reign of the White Witch - it is for this reason that the White Witch is always looking out for humans in Narnia. They all soon see that Edmund has disappeared - Mr. Beaver instantly realises that he has betrayed them to the White Witch. He is more convinced of this when he learns that Edmund had previously been to Narnia alone and not told his siblings what he had done or who he had met. The Beavers realise that the Witch will soon come after them and prepare for their journey to meet Aslan at the Stone Table. Edmund arrives at the Witch's house - the Witch is furious that he came alone and even more furious when he tells her that Aslan has come to Narnia.\n\ndoc374355: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The radio-announcer that Peter listens to on the rainy day near the beginning of the film is played by Douglas Gresham, co-producer of the movie and C. S. Lewis's stepson.[4] Keynes' voice broke during filming, so some of his voice track had to be re-looped by his sister Soumaya.[4] Mr. Pevensie is only glimpsed in a photo which Edmund tries to retrieve during the bombing, which is of Sim-Evan Jones' father.[5]\n\ndoc797823: The Chronicles of Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, completed by the end of March 1949[17] and published by Geoffrey Bles in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1950, tells the story of four ordinary children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie, who have been evacuated to the English countryside from London in 1940 following the outbreak of World War II. They discover a wardrobe in Professor Digory Kirke's house that leads to the magical land of Narnia. The Pevensie children help Aslan, a talking lion, save Narnia from the evil White Witch, who has reigned over the land of Narnia for a century of perpetual winter with no Christmas. The children become kings and queens of this new-found land and establish the Golden Age of Narnia, leaving a legacy to be rediscovered in later books.\n\ndoc556111: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1979 film). When four children Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter stumble into an old Wardrobe they find themselves in a magical land called Narnia with talking animals, fauns, hags, the Wicked White Witch and the great lion Aslan. There they meet the friendly Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them on their quest to find Aslan the great lion. Only he can help save Lucy's friend Mr. Tumnus (the faun) from the White Witch. They have a fun mysterious time there, and ultimately end up ruling as kings and queens, until they end up back home.\n\ndoc797863: The Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis's early life has parallels with The Chronicles of Narnia. At the age of seven, he moved with his family to a large house on the edge of Belfast. Its long hallways and empty rooms inspired Lewis and his brother to invent make-believe worlds whilst exploring their home, an activity reflected in Lucy's discovery of Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.[32] Like Caspian and Rilian, Lewis lost his mother at an early age, spending much of his youth in English boarding schools similar to those attended by the Pevensie children, Eustace Scrubb, and Jill Pole. During World War II many children were evacuated from London and other urban areas because of German air raids. Some of these children, including one named Lucy (Lewis's goddaughter) stayed with him at his home The Kilns near Oxford, just as the Pevensies stayed with The Professor in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.[33]\n\ndoc2440545: Mr. Tumnus. When Lucy returns to Narnia a few days later, Tumnus is still safe: evidently the White Witch hasn't discovered his disobedience.  However, Lucy's brother Edmund enters Narnia shortly afterward and mentions to the White Witch that his sister had visited Narnia before and met a faun. When Lucy and her siblings subsequently come to Narnia, they find that Tumnus has been arrested by Maugrim, Chief of the White Witch's secret police. Tumnus had spoken to Mr. Beaver of his fears not long before his arrest and asked him to guide the four children if he found them in Narnia. The children meet Mr. Beaver just after leaving Tumnus's ransacked cave.\n\ndoc374351: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Edmund sneaks off to visit the Witch. When he arrives at her castle, she is furious he has not delivered his siblings. The Witch sends wolves to track down the children and the beavers, who barely escape. Edmund is chained in the Witch's dungeon, where he meets Tumnus. The Witch demands Edmund reveal his siblings' location. After Tumnus claims that Edmund knows nothing, The Witch tells Mr. Tumnus Edmund betrayed him, then turns Tumnus to stone.\n\ndoc374358: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. During the early 1990s, producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were planning a film version.[13] They could not find a space in Britain to shoot the film during 1996,[14] and their plans to set the film in modern times[15] made Douglas Gresham oppose the film,[16] in addition to his feeling that technology had yet to catch up.[15] Perry Moore began negotiations with the C. S. Lewis Estate in 2000.[17] On December 7, 2001, Walden Media announced that they had acquired the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia.[18]\n\ndoc374354: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Fifteen years later, the Pevensie children, now young adults, chase a white stag through the forest. They encounter the lamppost Lucy saw earlier and suddenly tumble out of the wardrobe at the same time and day they left, becoming children again. Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe. Professor Kirke tells her he has tried for many years, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect it.\n\ndoc374352: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While Peter, Lucy, Susan, and the beavers travel, they hide from what they believe to be the White Witch. It is really Father Christmas, a sign that the Witch's reign is ending. Father Christmas gives them weapons to defend themselves. Lucy receives a healing cordial that can heal any injury. Susan receives a magical horn that will summon help and a bow and quiver full of arrows. Peter receives a sword. After evading wolves led by Maugrim, the group reaches Aslan's camp. Aslan is revealed as a huge and noble lion, who promises to help Edmund. Later, two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan. When Peter intervenes, Maugrim attacks him, and Peter kills him. Some of Aslan's troops follow the other wolf to the witch's camp and rescue Edmund. Peter is knighted by Aslan.\n\ndoc2193301: Mr. and Mrs. Beaver. In Prince Caspian', the black dwarf Nikabrik claims that the White Witch had eliminated beavers from Narnia. He was clearly mistaken.\n\ndoc374357: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan's voice was a contention point. Brian Cox was originally cast in the role on December 9, 2004,[10] but Adamson changed his mind.[11] Liam Neeson sought out the role,[7] and was announced as the voice on July 17, 2005.[12]\n\ndoc2562589: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are siblings who are sent to live with Professor Digory Kirke in the country side during World War 2. Whilst exploring the house one day, Lucy who is the youngest discovers a mysterious wardrobe and on entering it, finds herself in the middle of a snowy wood with a lamp post. She encounters a faun who introduces himself as Mr. Tumnus and reveals that Lucy has entered the land of Narnia. The seemingly kind faun invites Lucy to his cave for some tea and plays a tune on his flute which forces her into a deep sleep where she sees visions of what Narnia used to be like before winter. Lucy suddenly wakes up and realises she must go home but Mr. Tumnus breaks down and reveals that he is employed (albeit unwillingly) by the evil White Witch, who makes it always winter but never Christmas in Narnia. The Witch has ordered all Narnians to hand over any humans (or 'Sons of Adam' and ' Daughters of Eve' as they are known in Narnia). The faun realises he cannot hand over Lucy to the evil Witch, having understood what humans are like once he met her. He escorts her back to the lamp post and she returns back through the Wardrobe. Lucy tells her siblings of what she discovered in the wardrobe but they find nothing when they look. This, along with the fact that no time passed on Earth when Lucy entered the wardrobe, lead her siblings to believe that Lucy has been lying. A few days later, during a game of hide and seek, Lucy wonders back through the wardrobe and Edmund, the second youngest, and by far the most volatile of the four children, follows her. To Edmund's shock, he finds that Lucy was telling the truth about the country in the back of the wardrobe. Whilst looking for Lucy, Edmund comes across a sleigh transporting a lady.\n\ndoc1417327: The Witches (novel). Shortly after arriving back in England, while the boy is working on the roof of the tree-house he has been building, he sees a strange woman in black staring up at him with an eerie smile, and he realizes that she is a witch. When the witch offers him a snake to tempt him, he climbs further up the tree and stays there, not daring to come down until his grandmother comes looking for him. This persuades the boy and his grandmother to be especially wary; and he carefully scrutinizes all women to determine whether or not they might be witches.\n\ndoc1985122: Land of Oz. White is the traditional color of witches in Oz. The Good Witch of the North wears a pointed white hat and a white gown decorated with stars, while Glinda, the Good Witch of the South (called a \"sorceress\" in later books), wears a pure white dress. Dorothy is taken for a witch not only because she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East, but because her dress is blue and white checked.[31]\n\ndoc374361: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Weta Workshop head Richard Taylor cited Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights as an inspiration on the film. He felt Narnia had to be less dark and gritty than their depiction of Middle-earth in The Lord of the Rings because it is a new world.[22] Many of Weta's creature designs were designed for digital creation, so when Howard Berger and KNB FX inherited the practical effects work, they had to spend three months retooling approved designs for animatronics.[23] Berger's children would comment and advise upon his designs; they suggested the White Witch's hair be changed from black to blonde, which Berger concurred with as he realized Swinton's wig looked too Gothic.[24]\n\ndoc797908: The Chronicles of Narnia. The Royal Shakespeare Company premiered The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1998. The novel was adapted as a musical production by Adrian Mitchell, with music by Shaun Davey.[91] The show was originally directed by Adrian Noble and designed by Anthony Ward, with the revival directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace. Well received by audiences, the production was periodically re-staged by the RSC for several years afterwards.[92] Limited engagements were subsequently undertaken at the Barbican Theatre in London and at Sadler's Wells. This adaptation also toured the United States in the early 2000s.\n\ndoc376719: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. During a game of hide-and-seek on some days later, Lucy again passes into Narnia. This time her brother Edmund chances to follow her. He meets Jadis, who calls herself Queen of Narnia. When she learns that he is human and has two sisters and a brother, she places an enchantment on him. She urges him to bring his siblings to her castle, promising in return to make him her heir. When Lucy and Edmund return together through the wardrobe, Edmund realizes that the queen he met and the witch Lucy describes are one and the same. He denies to the others that he has been in Narnia at all. Peter and Susan are puzzled by Lucy's insistence, and consult the Professor, who surprises them by taking Lucy's side in the debate of Narnia's existence.\n\ndoc337974: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game). A significant feature has William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Anna Popplewell, Georgie Henley, Elizabeth Hawthorne, and Jim Broadbent reprising their roles from the film.\n\ndoc62369: White Witch. Jadis insists on her right as the first to rebel against Aslan to take the life of Edmund as a traitor. She accepts Aslan's offer of his own life as substitute, knowing that without him the Pevensies cannot stand against her - even with the support of Aslan's army - although this pact is kept a secret from Aslan's followers. At the Stone Table, she and her followers bind Aslan and humiliate him, and Jadis kills him with a stone knife. Susan and Lucy witness the killing from nearby bushes after following Aslan from their encampment.\n\ndoc513340: Maugrim. Maugrim is a fictional character in the novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis. A Narnian wolf, he is Captain of the White Witch's Secret Police. In early American editions of the book, Lewis changed the name to Fenris Ulf (a wolf from Norse mythology), but when HarperCollins took over the books they took out Lewis' revisions,[1] and the name Maugrim has been used in all editions since 1994.[2]\n\ndoc797906: The Chronicles of Narnia. In 1984, Vanessa Ford Productions presented The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe at London's Westminster Theatre. Adapted by Glyn Robbins, the play was directed by Richard Williams and designed by Marty Flood. The production was later revived at Westminster and The Royalty Theatre and went on tour until 1997. Productions of other tales from The Chronicles were also staged, including The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1986), The Magician's Nephew (1988) and The Horse and His Boy (1990).\n\ndoc374380: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. For the song \"Can't Take It In\"\n\ndoc376751: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Lewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis's publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.[21]\n\ndoc1369961: Susan Pevensie. Susan Pevensie is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia series. Susan is the elder sister and the second eldest Pevensie child. She appears in three of the seven books\u00e2\u20ac\u201das a child in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian, and as an adult in The Horse and His Boy. She is also mentioned in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Last Battle. During her reign at the Narnian capital of Cair Paravel, she is known as Queen Susan the Gentle or Queen Susan of the Horn. She was the only Pevensie that survived the train wreck (because she was not on the train or at the station) on Earth which sent the others to Narnia after The Last Battle.[2]\n\ndoc374347: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. During World War II, the Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are evacuated from a London suburb to Professor Digory Kirke's country home. Mrs Macready, the strict housekeeper, explains he is unaccustomed to hosting children.\n\ndoc62371: White Witch. In Prince Caspian, 1,300 years after her death, Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines, a human race who believe they have wiped out Narnia's population of talking animals. Since the fight to expel the Telmarines is going badly, a black dwarf (Nikabrik), a hag, and a wer-wolf (to use Lewis's spelling) plan to resurrect Jadis to fight against the Telmarines, as they consider her a lesser evil than the current ruler, King Miraz, whose ancestors had invaded Narnia and believed that they had wiped out the talking animals, and forbade any mention of their existence or the existence of Aslan. However, talking animals continued to live in hiding in isolated parts of Narnia, and are eventually discovered by Prince Caspian after he flees his Uncle Miraz's castle. They join his side, but Nikabrik, the hag and the were-wolf will stop at nothing to oust Miraz, despite Caspian's warnings that the Witch was \"a hundred times worse than Miraz himself\" - they are then killed in a melee which involves Caspian, his tutor Dr Cornelius, and the returning Peter and Edmund, who have been recalled to Narnia after Caspian blows Susan's horn. On the orders of Aslan and the newly-crowned King Caspian, Narnia is now a land in which humans and talking animals are encouraged to integrate and have equal rights - although a small number of Telmarines accept Aslan's offer of building a new life for themselves on Planet Earth, on the Pacific island where their pirate descendants had entered Narnia through a cave in the early 1940s.\n\ndoc376723: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Meanwhile, Mr Beaver realises that Edmund has betrayed them, and they set off at once to seek Aslan at the Stone Table. As they travel, the Witch's spell over Narnia begins to break: Father Christmas (who has not been seen in Narnia for a hundred years) arrives with magical presents: a sword for Peter, a horn and a bow with arrows for Susan, a knife and a bottle of healing cordial for Lucy. The snow melts, and winter ends. Aslan welcomes the children and the Beavers to his camp near the Stone Table. Upon hearing Edmund's situation, he orders a rescue party of loyal Narnians.\n\ndoc73653: The Chronicles of Narnia (film series). The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, based on the novel of the same title, is the first film in the series. Directed by Andrew Adamson, it was shot mainly in New Zealand, though locations were used in Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom.\n\ndoc910359: Aslan. He is first mentioned by Mr. Beaver, who tells the Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) that \"Aslan is on the move\". He explains that Aslan is the true king of Narnia and that the children (as Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve) are the chosen ones to help end the tyrannical rule of the White Witch. Even as the children explore Narnia, Aslan's presence begins to weaken Jadis' grip on the land; the ice begins to melt and Father Christmas appears at last and gives the children gifts.\n\ndoc644998: Anna Popplewell. Her first major role was in the film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) where she played Susan Pevensie. She has a phobia of mice, which required a double to do part of her scene at the Stone Table in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.[2] She reprised her role in the sequel, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, in which she acted with William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley and Ben Barnes. The film opened in cinemas 16 May 2008. She also made a cameo appearance in the third Narnia film, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.\n\ndoc374362: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Principal photography began in New Zealand on June 28, 2004,[25] shooting in primarily chronological order.[5] Adamson did this in order to naturally create a sense of mature development from his young actors, which mirrored their real life development.[16] Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes[7] were never shown the set before filming scenes of their characters entering Narnia, nor had Henley seen James McAvoy in his Mr. Tumnus costume before shooting their scenes together.[4]\n\ndoc374367: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The soundtrack was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams. Gregson-Williams had previously worked with Adamson on Shrek (2001) and Shrek 2 (2004). In addition there are three original songs in the film; Can't Take It In by Imogen Heap, Wunderkind by Alanis Morissette and Winter Light by Tim Finn. Evanescence lead singer Amy Lee also wrote a song for the film, but it was not included in the soundtrack.[31]\n\ndoc62385: White Witch. Jadis appears in the Neil Gaiman short story \"The Problem of Susan\" which appeared in the collection \"Fragile Things\".\n\ndoc337977: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game). The player can also collect coins, which may be traded in for special moves and character upgrades, such as an increase in health.[5] The player may also mark statues of petrified heroes for Aslan to restore; this directly affects the amount of reinforcements that the player will have in the final battle against the White Witch.[4] Other bonus items can be found and collected throughout the game.[5]\n\ndoc2440544: Mr. Tumnus. Tumnus first appears when Lucy arrives in Narnia at the lamp-post. He invites her back to his cave for tea, during which, they talk about Narnia. Tumnus then plays  his flute, and Lucy falls asleep. When Lucy wakes up, she sees him in tears. He confesses that he is in the pay of the White Witch (Jadis), who rules Narnia and has made it always winter but never Christmas. She had ordered him and the other Narnians to hand over any Sons of Adam or Daughters of Eve - humans - that he sees in Narnia. Tumnus, despite knowing that the Witch will find out if he disobeys her orders, quickly realises that he can't bear to give Lucy up to the Witch, so he guides her back to the lamp-post to see that she returns safely to her own world.\n\ndoc797879: The Chronicles of Narnia. J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, has said that she was a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the influence of The Chronicles on her work: \"I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross Station\u00a0\u2014 it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts.\"[52] Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: \"Narnia is literally a different world\", she says, \"whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal.\"[52] New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until he is redeemed by Aslan.[53]\n\ndoc376729: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Fifteen years later, the four rulers chase a wish-granting white stag through the forest whereupon they rediscover the lamppost. They soon find their way not through branches but coats. They come back through the wardrobe in the Professor's house and are suddenly children again, dressed in their old clothes. Almost no time has passed in the real world, despite their many years in Narnia.\n\ndoc797907: The Chronicles of Narnia. In 1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre and musical production company, produced a musical rendition of \"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" that Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film adaptations), has openly declared that he feels is the closest to Lewis's intent. The book and lyrics were written by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Inocian, while the music was composed by Lito Villareal.[89][90]\n\ndoc325325: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. At another island, Lucy is abducted by the invisible Dufflepuds, who force her to enter the manor of the magician Coriakin to find a visibility spell. She does so, and later introduces him to her friends. Coriakin encourages the crew to defeat the mist by laying the lords' seven swords at Aslan's Table on Ramandu's island, but warns them that they are about to be tested, through temptation. Lucy recites a beauty incantation she found, and enters a dream in which she has transformed into Susan and neither Lucy nor Narnia exist. Aslan chides Lucy for her self-doubt, explaining that her siblings only know of Narnia because of her, telling her \"don't run away from who you are\".\n\ndoc62375: White Witch. A natural-born sorceress and a cunning strategist, Jadis is arrogant and cruel, considering herself above all rules and viewing others as tools to be used or obstacles to be demolished. After she eats the Fruit of Everlasting Life, selfishly and against the written admonition on the gate, she discovers that her sense of inner power and life is amplified. Her callousness and sense of entitlement is most clearly demonstrated when she uses the Deplorable Word in Charn to vanquish her sister, even though the Word would eradicate all life in that world but her own. She prefers to destroy that entire world than submit to her sister's authority, and shows afterward a remorseless pride in her actions.\n\ndoc376728: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Meanwhile, Peter and Edmund lead the Narnians against Jadis, and Edmund is seriously wounded. Aslan arrives with the former statues as reinforcements. The Narnians rout Jadis's supporters, and Aslan kills Jadis. Aslan breathes life into those Jadis has turned to stone on the battlefield, and Lucy uses her magic cordial to revive the wounded, starting with Edmund. The Pevensie children are crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel. Soon afterward, Aslan slips away and disappears.\n\ndoc797853: The Chronicles of Narnia. Tumnus is a faun who is featured prominently in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and also appears in The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle. He is close friends with Lucy and is the first creature she meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series. Lewis said that the first Narnia story came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood. In that way, Tumnus was the initial inspiration for the entire Narnia series.[29]\n\ndoc62377: White Witch. The voice of Jadis was provided by Elizabeth Counsell in Focus on the Family's radio drama versions of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Magician's Nephew. Counsell also made a cameo appearance as a lamb in The Last Battle.\n\ndoc374363: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The first scene shot was at the former RNZAF Base Hobsonville for the railway scene.[26] Afterwards, they shot the Blitz scene, which Adamson called their first formal day of shooting.[8]\n\ndoc910365: Aslan. The novel Prince Caspian takes place 1,300 Narnian years after the events in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan and the Pevensie children have become near-forgotten \"myths\", and Narnia is now ruled by Telmarines, humans who have since conquered and settled in Narnia.\n\ndoc797857: The Chronicles of Narnia. The main setting of The Chronicles of Narnia is the world of Narnia constructed by Lewis and, in The Magician's Nephew, the world containing the city of Charn. The Narnian and Charnian worlds are themselves posited as just two in a multiverse of countless worlds that includes our own universe, the main protagonists' world of origin. Passage between these worlds is possible, though rare, and may be accomplished by various means. Narnia itself is described as populated by a wide variety of creatures, most of which would be recognisable to those familiar with European mythologies and British and Irish fairy tales.\n\n"

Meanwhile, the land of Narnia remains the domain of animals (chosen animals are given the ability to speak, and become pillars of society) and is not troubled by the Witch nor any other enemy for many hundred years.\n\ndoc797849: The Chronicles of Narnia. Jadis, commonly known during her rule of Narnia as the White Witch, is the main antagonist of The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. She is the witch responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting in the Hundred Year Winter. The White Witch was born in the world of Charn, before the creation of Narnia, and died in battle in Narnian year 1000.\n\ndoc62362: White Witch. Many years later, a 12-year-old Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer arrive in the ruins of Charn through Digory's uncle's magic. The children find the bell that Jadis left to break the spell. Despite Polly's warning not to ring the bell, Digory does so. Jadis is awakened and by holding on to them is transported with them back to London in the year 1900. She initially aims to conquer the world to which she is transported, but finds that her magic does not work there. Digory, seeking to correct his mistake, attempts to transport her back to Charn, but they end up instead in the world of Narnia at the moment of its creation by the lion Aslan. As Aslan approaches, she attacks him with the rod of iron she has torn by main strength from a London lamp post; but when this has no effect, she flees.\n\ndoc62366: White Witch. She styles herself \"Her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands\", and she casts Narnia into an endless winter with no Christmas. She fears a prophecy that four humans, two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve, will cause her downfall, and orders all Narnians - including those who might oppose her - to bring any human they come across to her.\n\ndoc62363: White Witch. Jadis makes her way to the garden on a mountain west of Narnia, where she eats an apple that she believes will make her immortal and give her eternal life. However, this supposed immortality comes at a cost: her skin is bleached white, and the evil in her heart causes her eternal misery. She cannot stand the sight of the tree that Aslan has Digory plant in Narnia from the fruit of the garden, and she thus stays to the north of Narnia, working to develop her magic.\n\ndoc62379: White Witch. In the 2005 Walt Disney Pictures feature film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, she was portrayed by British actress Tilda Swinton. Swinton's performance won particular acclaim among fans and critics. BBC film critic Stella Papamichael wrote:[3]\n\ndoc62367: White Witch. By the time the Pevensie children arrive in Narnia, Jadis has ruled for 100 years. She first meets Edmund Pevensie, enchants him with magical Turkish delight, and tempts him to betray his siblings by offering to make him her heir and bring them to Narnia with him, although at this stage only Edmund and his sister Lucy have been in Narnia. The four Pevensie children all arrive in Narnia together soon afterwards, and Edmund strays to the Witch after he and the other children are taken in by Mr and Mrs Beaver. He had realised that the \"Queen of Narnia\" (as she had introduced herself) and the White Witch were one and the same after a conversation with Lucy, but was still determined to taste more Turkish Delight and remained convinced that the Witch would deliver her promise to make him heir to her throne.\n\ndoc62365: White Witch. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, set 1,000 Narnian years after the events of The Magician's Nephew, Jadis has usurped power over Narnia after the tree that kept her at bay had died. Now known as the White Witch, she is served by various races including Wolves (who make up her secret police), Black Dwarves, Giants, Werewolves, Tree Spirits that are on her side, Ghouls, Boggles, Ogres, Minotaurs, Cruels, Hags, Spectres, People of the Toadstools, Incubi, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Orknies, Sprites, Wooses, Ettins, Poisonous Plant Spirits, Evil Apes, Giant Bats, Vultures, and creatures that according to C. S. Lewis are \"so horrible that if I told you, your parents probably wouldn't let you read this book.\" Her magic is now powerful, and she has acquired a wand with which she can turn enemies to stone if they displease or attempt to challenge her in any way.\n\ndoc62357: White Witch. Jadis is the main antagonist of The Magician's Nephew and of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in C. S. Lewis's series, The Chronicles of Narnia. She is commonly referred to as the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, as she is the Witch who froze Narnia in the Hundred Years Winter.\n\ndoc62382: White Witch. Swinton reprised her role as the White Witch in the 2008 Disney Movie sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. In a departure from the novel, Nikabrik and his fellow conspirators manage to conjure an apparition of Jadis within a mystical wall of ice and attempt to offer her Caspian X as she needs a drop of blood from a son of Adam to fully resurrect herself. She tries to coax Caspian into offering her his blood and then from Peter, promising to lend her powers to their fight against King Miraz once she is made whole. However, Edmund shatters the ice before the Witch can obtain a drop of blood, and the apparition vanishes.\n\ndoc62368: White Witch. But with the approach of Aslan, her magical winter thaws, and Edmund is rescued after his treason. He had been greeted with a hostile reception from the White Witch after arriving at her castle alone, and even more so after informing her that Aslan had come to Narnia. The harshness of the Witch's winter had made Edmund realise that he had been wrong in thinking that her side was the right side to be on, and he realised the full extent of her evil when he witnessed her turning a party of creatures into stone after their revelation that Father Christmas had been in Narnia - much to the Witch's horror after she had banished him.\n\ndoc62360: White Witch. (This reference to Lilith is a tribute to the fantasy novel with this title by George MacDonald, a literary hero of C.S. Lewis.) Jadis died in battle in Narnian year 1000, meaning that she lived for well over 1,000 years.\n\ndoc62370: White Witch. She is unaware, however, that due to a deeper magic from before Narnia's founding, that Aslan's life will be restored as he was an innocent, willing victim who had offered his life in a traitor's stead. Aslan then reaches her castle and restores all her statues to life, and brings them as reinforcements to the battle at Beruna against the witch's army. Her army is defeated, and Aslan himself kills Jadis, while most of her followers are killed and the remnants of her army flee and are eventually killed by Aslan's followers, who now serve Narnia under their new rulers.\n\ndoc62359: White Witch. Jadis was born on an unknown date long before the creation of Narnia. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe she is identified as a descendant of Adam's first wife (Lilith) and the giants:\n\ndoc337981: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game). The fantasy land of Narnia has been under the spell of the evil White Witch, who makes it always winter but never Christmas, but when Aslan comes, it will be spring again and the Witch's reign will be over. Four children enter Narnia and, along with the legendary lion, Aslan, help defeat the White Witch and her evil minions.(This version is based on the 2005 film.)\n\ndoc374344: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a 2005 British-American high fantasy film directed by Andrew Adamson and based on The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the first published and second chronological novel in C. S. Lewis's children's epic fantasy series, The Chronicles of Narnia. It was co-produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures. William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley play Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, four British children evacuated during the Blitz to the countryside, who find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There they ally with the Lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) against the forces of Jadis, the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).\n\ndoc73647: The Chronicles of Narnia (film series). The series revolves around the adventures of children in the world of Narnia, guided by Aslan, a wise and powerful lion that can speak and is the true king of Narnia. The children heavily featured in the films are the Pevensie siblings, and a prominent antagonist is the White Witch (also known as Jadis).\n\ndoc374349: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. One night, Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, entering Narnia. After searching for Lucy, meets the White Witch, who claims to be queen. She offers him Turkish Delight and the prospect of becoming king if he brings his siblings to her castle. After she departs, Edmund and Lucy meet again and return. Lucy tells Peter and Susan what happened, but Edmund lies. Professor Kirke suggests she is telling the truth, though they remain unconvinced.\n\ndoc376717: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. In 1940, four siblings \u2013 Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie \u2013 are among many children evacuated from London during World War II to escape the Blitz. They are sent to the countryside to live with professor Digory Kirke. Exploring the professor's house, Lucy finds a wardrobe which doubles as a magic portal to a forest in a land called Narnia. At a lamppost oddly located in the forest, she meets Tumnus, a faun, who invites her to tea in his home. There the faun confesses that he invited her not out of hospitality, but with the intention of betraying her to the White Witch. The witch has ruled Narnia for years, using magic to keep it frozen in a perpetual winter. She has ordered all Narnians to turn in any humans (\"Sons of Adam\" or \"Daughters of Eve\") they come across. But now that he has come to know and like a human, Tumnus repents his original intention and escorts Lucy back to the lamppost.\n\ndoc374350: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While running away from Mrs. Macready after accidentally breaking a window, the four siblings retreat to the wardrobe and enter Narnia. They discover the Witch has taken Mr. Tumnus, and they meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who tell them about Aslan. According to the beavers, Aslan intends to take control of Narnia from the Witch. The four must help Aslan; it has been prophesied that if two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit in the four thrones, the White Witch's reign will end.\n\ndoc73654: The Chronicles of Narnia (film series). The story follows the four British Pevensie siblings, who are evacuated during the Blitz to the countryside, where they find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There, they must ally with the lion Aslan against the forces of the White Witch, who has placed Narnia in an eternal winter.\n\ndoc797878: The Chronicles of Narnia. Lev Grossman's New York Times best-seller The Magicians is a contemporary dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the magical land of his favourite childhood books. Fillory is a thinly veiled substitute for Narnia, and clearly the author expects it to be experienced as such. Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock in the home of an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II. Moreover, the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised by The Watcherwoman. She, like the White Witch, freezes the land in time. The book's plot revolves heavily around a place very like the \"wood between the worlds\" from The Magician's Nephew, an interworld waystation in which pools of water lead to other lands. This reference to The Magician's Nephew is echoed in the title of the book.[51]\n\ndoc374356: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. With the exception of Tilda Swinton, who was the first choice to play Jadis, the White Witch,[6] casting was a long process. Beginning in 2002,[7] Adamson went through 2500 audition tapes, met 1800 children and workshopped 400 before coming down to the final four actors for the Pevensies. Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting, whilst Henley and Keynes were cast relatively late.[8] Moseley was cast because casting director Pippa Hall remembered she cast him as an extra in Cider with Rosie (1998). He beat 3000 boys to the role of Peter and quit school to learn all his lines.[9]\n\ndoc376720: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Soon afterward, all four children enter Narnia together after hiding in the wardrobe to avoid the professor's dour housekeeper, Mrs. Macready. Remembering the winter cold ahead, they take coats from the wardrobe before exploring. Lucy guides them to Tumnus's cave, but they find it ransacked, with a notice from Jadis (the White Witch) proclaiming his arrest for harbouring humans.\n\ndoc62376: White Witch. Though her magic disappears when she leaves Charn, she manages to build it up again in Narnia's world, exercising both her previous experience and her privilege to witness a new world's dawning, to become again a sorceress of formidable power. In her own dominion, Charn, Jadis is extremely powerful; but she finds her magic largely useless in other worlds. She eventually strengthens her powers and usurps the throne of Narnia, using her magic to cast the land into perpetual winter. Her most feared weapon is her wand, whose magic is capable of turning people into stone. The petrified remains of her enemies decorate the halls of her castle. Her other powers, which she immediately loses after entering another world, include the ability to disintegrate objects and individuals, read minds, control the minds of animals (She does possibly retain or regain this power in Narnia) and the terrifying power of the Deplorable Word - the latter of which wipes out every living thing on a planet except for the speaker. For the brief period of time that Jadis is on Earth, she is shown to have no magical power, but to retain her phenomenal strength. This is demonstrated when she battles with Metropolitan Police in London, wielding the cross-bar she wrenched from a lamp post. The same cross-bar was taken into the new world that would become Narnia, and grew into the full lamp post encountered by Lucy Pevensie many years later.\n\ndoc62374: White Witch. An extraordinarily beautiful, tall and imposing woman, Jadis enchants Digory Kirke, Andrew Ketterley and Edmund Pevensie on first encounters. She is seven feet tall, as were all members of the Royal Family of Charn. After eating the fruit of eternal life, her skin becomes as white as paper.\n\ndoc374348: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While the Pevensies play hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a wardrobe and enters the fantasy world called Narnia. Seeing a lamppost, Lucy encounters the faun Mr. Tumnus, who invites her to his home. He puts Lucy to sleep by playing a lullaby on his flute. When Lucy wakes up, she finds Tumnus grieving. He explains that Jadis, the White Witch, has cursed Narnia to a hundred years of winter. If a human is encountered, they are to be brought to her. Tumnus cannot bring himself to kidnap Lucy, so he sends her home. When she returns to Professor Kirke's house, hardly any time has passed, and her siblings disbelieve her story.\n\ndoc910362: Aslan. With her greatest adversary dead, the White Witch leaves with her army to prepare for war against the Narnians, convinced that she will win. Lucy, Susan, and a number of mice remove the bonds from Aslan's body; but as the Stone Table breaks they find that his body is gone. To their shock, Aslan reappears alive and well, thanks to a Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time. The Witch, having entered Narnia only at the Dawn of Time, had not known of this. Aslan explains that the Deeper Magic is invoked when an innocent willingly offers his life in place of a traitor's, causing death itself to be reversed until the victim is reborn.\n\ndoc374353: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The White Witch journeys to Aslan's camp and claims Edmund, but Aslan secretly offers to sacrifice himself instead. That night, as Lucy and Susan covertly watch, the White Witch fatally stabs Aslan. In the morning, he is resurrected, citing magic beyond the Witch's understanding. Aslan takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle, where he frees the prisoners she turned to stone. Edmund persuades Peter to lead Aslan's army. While saving Peter from the Witch, Edmund is mortally wounded. As the Witch fights Peter, Aslan arrives with reinforcements and kills her. After Edmund is revived by Lucy's cordial, the Pevensies are crowned King Peter the Magnificent, Queen Susan the Gentle, King Edmund the Just, and Queen Lucy the Valiant.\n\ndoc376716: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Most of the novel is set in Narnia, a land of talking animals and mythical creatures that one White Witch has ruled for 100 years of deep winter. In the frame story, four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a wartime evacuation. The youngest visits Narnia three times via the magic of a wardrobe in a spare room. All four children are together on her third visit, which verifies her fantastic claims and comprises the subsequent 12 of 17 chapters except for a brief conclusion. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfill an old prophecy and so are soon adventuring both to save Narnia and their lives. Lewis wrote the book for, and dedicated it to, his goddaughter Lucy Barfield. She was the daughter of Owen Barfield, Lewis's friend, teacher, adviser, and trustee.[4]\n\ndoc797841: The Chronicles of Narnia. Echoing the Christian theme of betrayal, repentance, and subsequent redemption via blood sacrifice, Edmund betrays his siblings to Jadis, the White Witch, but quickly realises the true nature of the witch and her evil intentions towards his siblings, and joins Aslan's side. At that point he is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan's life and he joins the fight against the White Witch. Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan, and of all the human characters who visit Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most.\n\ndoc910358: Aslan. Aslan is first introduced in the book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which takes place one thousand years after Narnia's founding. Narnia is now in the hundredth year of the tyrannical rule of Jadis, who has returned as a powerful sorceress called the White Witch. Jadis has condemned the land to endless winter \u2013 but never Christmas \u2013 and has turned hundreds of Aslan's followers to stone.\n\ndoc2562588: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). In the magical land of Narnia, there is always winter but never Christmas due to the tyrannical rule of the White Witch. The Witch fears a prophecy which states that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will be crowned kings and queens of Narnia, ending her life. When she learns that the four Pevensie children have arrived in Narnia, she will stop at nothing to prevent them from fulfilling this prophecy. However, the Great Lion Aslan is on the move to help the four children to save Narnia.\n\ndoc325364: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. With the introduction of the quest for the seven swords, a reappearance of the White Witch, and a larger role for Eustace in dragon form, the movie adaptation attempts to appeal to Everyman and not just to Lewis fans and Christian audiences. Nonetheless, Christian reviewers found much to like. Key for many was the closing scene where Aslan assures Lucy that he is indeed in her own world, where he has another name, and that she was brought to Narnia so that she might come to know him better in her own world. This contrasts with the reception of the first two Narnia films, which Christian reviewers felt lacked key incidents and themes from the corresponding books, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian.[116][117]\n\ndoc374366: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. They filmed in the Czech Republic (Prague and National Park \u010cesk\u00e9 \u0160v\u00fdcarsko), Slovenia and Poland after the Christmas break,[5] before wrapping in February.[30]\n\ndoc1181153: The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Nikabrik tells Caspian that there is a way he can claim his throne and guarantee Miraz's death. When Caspian agrees, a hag uses black sorcery to summon the White Witch. From inside a wall of ice, the Witch tries to convince Caspian to give her a drop of his blood in order to set her free. Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin arrive and dispatch Nikabrik while Edmund shatters the wall of ice before the Witch can be freed.\n\ndoc2562590: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). The lady introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia and demands to know what Edmund is. On learning that Edmund is a son of Adam, she acts friendly towards him, even giving him a nice hot drink and Turkish delight. During their conversation, Edmund informs the Queen that he has a brother and two sisters and that Lucy had previously been to Narnia and met a faun. The Queen requests Edmund to bring his siblings to her house in Narnia, saying she will give him more Turkish delight if he does. She also makes him the offer of becoming a prince and then king of Narnia. Edmund is delighted by the Queen's offers. After the Queen leaves, Edmund finds Lucy and discovers that she has been with Mr. Tumnus, who has not been caught by the White Witch. When Lucy describes the White Witch, Edmund shockingly realises that she is none other than the woman he had just befriended - however, he does not tell Lucy of his encounter with her at this stage. Back in their own country, Lucy tells Peter and Susan that Edmund has also got into Narnia, but Edmund lies saying that he and Lucy were only pretending that Narnia existed. Peter is furious with Edmund for setting Lucy off, especially after Edmund had been treating Lucy cruelly over her 'false' stories of Narnia. Peter and Susan seek advice from Professor Kirke who is completely convinced that logically, Lucy is telling the truth. A few days pass and the four children are on the run from the Professor's housekeeper who is hosting a tour of the house. They end up hiding in the wardrobe and all find themselves in Narnia, realising that Lucy was indeed right. They go to visit Mr. Tumnus, but find his cave destroyed. They discover a note, signed by Maugrim, captain of the secret police, saying that Mr. Tumnus has been arrested for high treason against the Queen of Narnia, which includes fraternising with humans.\n\ndoc376735: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The magical land of Narnia is populated by talking animals, mythological species, and sentient flora.\n\ndoc797829: The Chronicles of Narnia. Completed in February 1954[20] and published by Bodley Head in London on 2 May 1955, the prequel The Magician's Nephew brings the reader back to the origins of Narnia where we learn how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it. Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings made by Digory's uncle. They encounter Jadis (The White Witch) in the dying world of Charn, and witness the creation of Narnia. Many long-standing questions about the world are answered as a result. The story is set in 1900, when Digory was a 12-year-old boy. He is a middle-aged professor and host to the Pevensie children by the time of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 40 years later.\n\ndoc62378: White Witch. In the BBC Radio productions of The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe[clarification needed] Jadis was played by Rosemary Martin.\n\ndoc62358: White Witch. Some recent editions of the books include brief notes, added by later editors, that describe the cast of characters. As Lewis scholar Peter Schakel points out, the description there of Jadis and the Queen of Underland (the main antagonist of The Silver Chair) \"states incorrectly that the Queen of Underland is an embodiment of Jadis\".[1] Beyond characterising the two as \"Northern Witches\", Lewis's text does not connect them. See Lady of the Green Kirtle for further discussion.\n\ndoc62373: White Witch. In The Silver Chair, 1,356 years after her death, Jadis is called one of the \"Northern Witches\", along with the Lady of the Green Kirtle - a new enemy to the good animals and humans who now inhabit Narnia. Glimfeather the Owl speculates that the Green Lady may be \"of the same crew\" as the White Witch. This has led to speculation by some readers that Jadis and the Lady of the Green Kirtle may be the same person. Lewis's text does not support this (See Lady of the Green Kirtle for further discussion). Lewis never clarifies the Green Lady's origins, or what connection she has to the White Witch. The \"Green Lady\" had first entered Narnia in serpent form and killed the wife of King Caspian, and later re-emerged in human form to lure away Caspian's son Rilian and place him under an enchantment in the underworld, only for Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole to reach the underworld with their guide, Puddleglum the marshwiggle, and rescue Rilian - who kills the Green Lady before they make their return to Narnia.\n\ndoc62383: White Witch. Swinton reprised White Witch again in the 20th Century Fox film adaptation of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, only as a manifestation of Dark Island preying on Edmund's insecurities, a mental test that Edmund overcomes as he manages to kill the Dark Island's sea serpent, a manifestation of his fear.\n\ndoc368592: Lucy Pevensie. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Lucy is the first of the Pevensies to enter Narnia through a magical wardrobe in the Professor's old house, into Narnia in the One Hundred Year Winter, under the rule of the White Witch, the evil self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia. There she meets Mr. Tumnus the Faun and, then later, the Beavers.\n\ndoc374365: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The cast and crew spent their time in New Zealand in Auckland before moving in November to the South Island. Shooting locations on the South Island included, Flock Hill in Canterbury, the area known as Elephant Rocks near Duntroon in North Otago, which was transformed into Aslan's camp.[28] The castle scene was filmed in Purakaunui Bay, in The Catlins district, not far from the most southern point in New Zealand.[29]\n\ndoc62384: White Witch. Swinton expressed interest in returning the role once more in a film adaptation of The Magician's Nephew.\n\ndoc376758: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Narnia is caught in endless winter that has lasted a century when the children first enter. Norse tradition mythologises a \"great winter,\" known as the Fimbulwinter, said to precede Ragnar\u00f6k. The trapping of Edmund by the White Witch is reminiscent of the seduction and imprisonment of Kay by The Snow Queen in Hans Christian Andersen's novella of that name.[34]\n\ndoc376760: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. There are several parallels between the White Witch and the immortal white queen, Ayesha, of H. Rider Haggard's She, a novel greatly admired by C.S. Lewis.[35]\n\ndoc139811: Jennifer Coolidge. Epic Movie, released in 2007 and made by the same people behind Date Movie, was the first movie in which she received a starring role. In the film she played the \"White Bitch\" (the White Witch) of Gnarnia (Narnia), a lampoon of the Disney and Walden Media film The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film \"irreverent and also appreciative, dragging its satiric prey down to the lowest pop-cultural denominator\" and added, \"The humor is coarse and occasionally funny. The archly bombastic score . . . is the only thing you might call witty. But happily, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard show up . . . to add some easy, demented class.\"[20]\n\ndoc910360: Aslan. Edmund, who was enchanted by the White Witch on his first visit to Narnia by eating enchanted Turkish Delight, attempts to betray his siblings and is not present to receive a gift. Mr. and Mrs. Beaver lead the others to Aslan at the Stone Table at a large gathering of Loyal Narnians preparing for war.  Aslan sends his creatures to rescue Edmund. Peter slays Maugrim the Wolf, chief of the Witch's secret police, and Aslan makes Peter a knight. He then sends his soldiers to rescue Edmund as the White Witch orders the wolf that witnessed Maugrim's death to rally her army.\n\ndoc376755: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Lewis wrote that \"The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal. Suppose there were a Narnian world and it, like ours, needed redemption. What kind of incarnation and Passion might Christ be supposed to undergo there?\"[29]\n\ndoc62361: White Witch. In The Magician's Nephew, Jadis is introduced as the Queen of Charn, a city in an entirely different world from Narnia. She was the last of a long line of kings and queens, who began well but grew evil over many generations and conquered the entire world of Charn. Jadis, a powerful sorceress, fought a bloody war of rebellion against her sister. On the point of defeat, Jadis chose not to submit, but spoke instead the Deplorable Word that destroyed all life on Charn except her own. She then cast a spell of enchanted sleep upon herself to await someone who could rescue her from Charn.\n\ndoc374364: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The filmmakers asked permission to bring in twelve reindeer to New Zealand to pull the White Witch's sled. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry denied, citing the potentially deadly Q fever from which the North American reindeer population suffers as the reason. However, ten wolves and wolf hybrids were allowed in for filming in Auckland.[27] To replace the denied live reindeer Mark Rappaport's Creature Effects, Inc. created four animatronic reindeer that were used in shots where the deer were standing in place. The reindeer were designed with replaceable skins to get the most usage; brown for Father Christmas's and white for those of the White Witch.\n\ndoc2562591: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). Lucy tells the others that the Queen is really the White Witch and convinces them to do something to save Mr. Tumnus, as she feels responsible for him being arrested. They travel on and soon encounter Mr. Beaver, who proves to be a friend by showing them a handkerchief which Lucy had given to Mr. Tumnus earlier. Mr. Beaver informs the children that Aslan is on the move - the name Aslan invokes an odd feeling in all four children. Mr. Beaver takes the children to his home. There, he and his wife Mrs. Beaver reveal that Mr. Tumnus was taken to the Witch's house and that he would have been turned into stone, as are most Narnians who go there. The children are given more information on Aslan, who is the Great Lion and the true king of Narnia who will save Mr. Tumnus. The Beavers also reveal that the children are part of a prophecy that states that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will be crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia, thus ending the reign of the White Witch - it is for this reason that the White Witch is always looking out for humans in Narnia. They all soon see that Edmund has disappeared - Mr. Beaver instantly realises that he has betrayed them to the White Witch. He is more convinced of this when he learns that Edmund had previously been to Narnia alone and not told his siblings what he had done or who he had met. The Beavers realise that the Witch will soon come after them and prepare for their journey to meet Aslan at the Stone Table. Edmund arrives at the Witch's house - the Witch is furious that he came alone and even more furious when he tells her that Aslan has come to Narnia.\n\ndoc374355: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The radio-announcer that Peter listens to on the rainy day near the beginning of the film is played by Douglas Gresham, co-producer of the movie and C. S. Lewis's stepson.[4] Keynes' voice broke during filming, so some of his voice track had to be re-looped by his sister Soumaya.[4] Mr. Pevensie is only glimpsed in a photo which Edmund tries to retrieve during the bombing, which is of Sim-Evan Jones' father.[5]\n\ndoc797823: The Chronicles of Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, completed by the end of March 1949[17] and published by Geoffrey Bles in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1950, tells the story of four ordinary children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie, who have been evacuated to the English countryside from London in 1940 following the outbreak of World War II. They discover a wardrobe in Professor Digory Kirke's house that leads to the magical land of Narnia. The Pevensie children help Aslan, a talking lion, save Narnia from the evil White Witch, who has reigned over the land of Narnia for a century of perpetual winter with no Christmas. The children become kings and queens of this new-found land and establish the Golden Age of Narnia, leaving a legacy to be rediscovered in later books.\n\ndoc556111: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1979 film). When four children Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter stumble into an old Wardrobe they find themselves in a magical land called Narnia with talking animals, fauns, hags, the Wicked White Witch and the great lion Aslan. There they meet the friendly Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them on their quest to find Aslan the great lion. Only he can help save Lucy's friend Mr. Tumnus (the faun) from the White Witch. They have a fun mysterious time there, and ultimately end up ruling as kings and queens, until they end up back home.\n\ndoc797863: The Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis's early life has parallels with The Chronicles of Narnia. At the age of seven, he moved with his family to a large house on the edge of Belfast. Its long hallways and empty rooms inspired Lewis and his brother to invent make-believe worlds whilst exploring their home, an activity reflected in Lucy's discovery of Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.[32] Like Caspian and Rilian, Lewis lost his mother at an early age, spending much of his youth in English boarding schools similar to those attended by the Pevensie children, Eustace Scrubb, and Jill Pole. During World War II many children were evacuated from London and other urban areas because of German air raids. Some of these children, including one named Lucy (Lewis's goddaughter) stayed with him at his home The Kilns near Oxford, just as the Pevensies stayed with The Professor in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.[33]\n\ndoc2440545: Mr. Tumnus. When Lucy returns to Narnia a few days later, Tumnus is still safe: evidently the White Witch hasn't discovered his disobedience.  However, Lucy's brother Edmund enters Narnia shortly afterward and mentions to the White Witch that his sister had visited Narnia before and met a faun. When Lucy and her siblings subsequently come to Narnia, they find that Tumnus has been arrested by Maugrim, Chief of the White Witch's secret police. Tumnus had spoken to Mr. Beaver of his fears not long before his arrest and asked him to guide the four children if he found them in Narnia. The children meet Mr. Beaver just after leaving Tumnus's ransacked cave.\n\ndoc374351: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Edmund sneaks off to visit the Witch. When he arrives at her castle, she is furious he has not delivered his siblings. The Witch sends wolves to track down the children and the beavers, who barely escape. Edmund is chained in the Witch's dungeon, where he meets Tumnus. The Witch demands Edmund reveal his siblings' location. After Tumnus claims that Edmund knows nothing, The Witch tells Mr. Tumnus Edmund betrayed him, then turns Tumnus to stone.\n\ndoc374358: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. During the early 1990s, producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were planning a film version.[13] They could not find a space in Britain to shoot the film during 1996,[14] and their plans to set the film in modern times[15] made Douglas Gresham oppose the film,[16] in addition to his feeling that technology had yet to catch up.[15] Perry Moore began negotiations with the C. S. Lewis Estate in 2000.[17] On December 7, 2001, Walden Media announced that they had acquired the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia.[18]\n\ndoc374354: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Fifteen years later, the Pevensie children, now young adults, chase a white stag through the forest. They encounter the lamppost Lucy saw earlier and suddenly tumble out of the wardrobe at the same time and day they left, becoming children again. Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe. Professor Kirke tells her he has tried for many years, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect it.\n\ndoc374352: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While Peter, Lucy, Susan, and the beavers travel, they hide from what they believe to be the White Witch. It is really Father Christmas, a sign that the Witch's reign is ending. Father Christmas gives them weapons to defend themselves. Lucy receives a healing cordial that can heal any injury. Susan receives a magical horn that will summon help and a bow and quiver full of arrows. Peter receives a sword. After evading wolves led by Maugrim, the group reaches Aslan's camp. Aslan is revealed as a huge and noble lion, who promises to help Edmund. Later, two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan. When Peter intervenes, Maugrim attacks him, and Peter kills him. Some of Aslan's troops follow the other wolf to the witch's camp and rescue Edmund. Peter is knighted by Aslan.\n\ndoc2193301: Mr. and Mrs. Beaver. In Prince Caspian', the black dwarf Nikabrik claims that the White Witch had eliminated beavers from Narnia. He was clearly mistaken.\n\ndoc374357: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan's voice was a contention point. Brian Cox was originally cast in the role on December 9, 2004,[10] but Adamson changed his mind.[11] Liam Neeson sought out the role,[7] and was announced as the voice on July 17, 2005.[12]\n\ndoc2562589: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988 TV serial). Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are siblings who are sent to live with Professor Digory Kirke in the country side during World War 2. Whilst exploring the house one day, Lucy who is the youngest discovers a mysterious wardrobe and on entering it, finds herself in the middle of a snowy wood with a lamp post. She encounters a faun who introduces himself as Mr. Tumnus and reveals that Lucy has entered the land of Narnia. The seemingly kind faun invites Lucy to his cave for some tea and plays a tune on his flute which forces her into a deep sleep where she sees visions of what Narnia used to be like before winter. Lucy suddenly wakes up and realises she must go home but Mr. Tumnus breaks down and reveals that he is employed (albeit unwillingly) by the evil White Witch, who makes it always winter but never Christmas in Narnia. The Witch has ordered all Narnians to hand over any humans (or 'Sons of Adam' and ' Daughters of Eve' as they are known in Narnia). The faun realises he cannot hand over Lucy to the evil Witch, having understood what humans are like once he met her. He escorts her back to the lamp post and she returns back through the Wardrobe. Lucy tells her siblings of what she discovered in the wardrobe but they find nothing when they look. This, along with the fact that no time passed on Earth when Lucy entered the wardrobe, lead her siblings to believe that Lucy has been lying. A few days later, during a game of hide and seek, Lucy wonders back through the wardrobe and Edmund, the second youngest, and by far the most volatile of the four children, follows her. To Edmund's shock, he finds that Lucy was telling the truth about the country in the back of the wardrobe. Whilst looking for Lucy, Edmund comes across a sleigh transporting a lady.\n\ndoc1417327: The Witches (novel). Shortly after arriving back in England, while the boy is working on the roof of the tree-house he has been building, he sees a strange woman in black staring up at him with an eerie smile, and he realizes that she is a witch. When the witch offers him a snake to tempt him, he climbs further up the tree and stays there, not daring to come down until his grandmother comes looking for him. This persuades the boy and his grandmother to be especially wary; and he carefully scrutinizes all women to determine whether or not they might be witches.\n\ndoc1985122: Land of Oz. White is the traditional color of witches in Oz. The Good Witch of the North wears a pointed white hat and a white gown decorated with stars, while Glinda, the Good Witch of the South (called a \"sorceress\" in later books), wears a pure white dress. Dorothy is taken for a witch not only because she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East, but because her dress is blue and white checked.[31]\n\ndoc374361: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Weta Workshop head Richard Taylor cited Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights as an inspiration on the film. He felt Narnia had to be less dark and gritty than their depiction of Middle-earth in The Lord of the Rings because it is a new world.[22] Many of Weta's creature designs were designed for digital creation, so when Howard Berger and KNB FX inherited the practical effects work, they had to spend three months retooling approved designs for animatronics.[23] Berger's children would comment and advise upon his designs; they suggested the White Witch's hair be changed from black to blonde, which Berger concurred with as he realized Swinton's wig looked too Gothic.[24]\n\ndoc797908: The Chronicles of Narnia. The Royal Shakespeare Company premiered The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1998. The novel was adapted as a musical production by Adrian Mitchell, with music by Shaun Davey.[91] The show was originally directed by Adrian Noble and designed by Anthony Ward, with the revival directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace. Well received by audiences, the production was periodically re-staged by the RSC for several years afterwards.[92] Limited engagements were subsequently undertaken at the Barbican Theatre in London and at Sadler's Wells. This adaptation also toured the United States in the early 2000s.\n\ndoc376719: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. During a game of hide-and-seek on some days later, Lucy again passes into Narnia. This time her brother Edmund chances to follow her. He meets Jadis, who calls herself Queen of Narnia. When she learns that he is human and has two sisters and a brother, she places an enchantment on him. She urges him to bring his siblings to her castle, promising in return to make him her heir. When Lucy and Edmund return together through the wardrobe, Edmund realizes that the queen he met and the witch Lucy describes are one and the same. He denies to the others that he has been in Narnia at all. Peter and Susan are puzzled by Lucy's insistence, and consult the Professor, who surprises them by taking Lucy's side in the debate of Narnia's existence.\n\ndoc337974: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game). A significant feature has William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Anna Popplewell, Georgie Henley, Elizabeth Hawthorne, and Jim Broadbent reprising their roles from the film.\n\ndoc62369: White Witch. Jadis insists on her right as the first to rebel against Aslan to take the life of Edmund as a traitor. She accepts Aslan's offer of his own life as substitute, knowing that without him the Pevensies cannot stand against her - even with the support of Aslan's army - although this pact is kept a secret from Aslan's followers. At the Stone Table, she and her followers bind Aslan and humiliate him, and Jadis kills him with a stone knife. Susan and Lucy witness the killing from nearby bushes after following Aslan from their encampment.\n\ndoc513340: Maugrim. Maugrim is a fictional character in the novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis. A Narnian wolf, he is Captain of the White Witch's Secret Police. In early American editions of the book, Lewis changed the name to Fenris Ulf (a wolf from Norse mythology), but when HarperCollins took over the books they took out Lewis' revisions,[1] and the name Maugrim has been used in all editions since 1994.[2]\n\ndoc797906: The Chronicles of Narnia. In 1984, Vanessa Ford Productions presented The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe at London's Westminster Theatre. Adapted by Glyn Robbins, the play was directed by Richard Williams and designed by Marty Flood. The production was later revived at Westminster and The Royalty Theatre and went on tour until 1997. Productions of other tales from The Chronicles were also staged, including The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1986), The Magician's Nephew (1988) and The Horse and His Boy (1990).\n\ndoc374380: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. For the song \"Can't Take It In\"\n\ndoc376751: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Lewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis's publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.[21]\n\ndoc1369961: Susan Pevensie. Susan Pevensie is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia series. Susan is the elder sister and the second eldest Pevensie child. She appears in three of the seven books\u00e2\u20ac\u201das a child in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian, and as an adult in The Horse and His Boy. She is also mentioned in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Last Battle. During her reign at the Narnian capital of Cair Paravel, she is known as Queen Susan the Gentle or Queen Susan of the Horn. She was the only Pevensie that survived the train wreck (because she was not on the train or at the station) on Earth which sent the others to Narnia after The Last Battle.[2]\n\ndoc374347: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. During World War II, the Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are evacuated from a London suburb to Professor Digory Kirke's country home. Mrs Macready, the strict housekeeper, explains he is unaccustomed to hosting children.\n\ndoc62371: White Witch. In Prince Caspian, 1,300 years after her death, Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines, a human race who believe they have wiped out Narnia's population of talking animals. Since the fight to expel the Telmarines is going badly, a black dwarf (Nikabrik), a hag, and a wer-wolf (to use Lewis's spelling) plan to resurrect Jadis to fight against the Telmarines, as they consider her a lesser evil than the current ruler, King Miraz, whose ancestors had invaded Narnia and believed that they had wiped out the talking animals, and forbade any mention of their existence or the existence of Aslan. However, talking animals continued to live in hiding in isolated parts of Narnia, and are eventually discovered by Prince Caspian after he flees his Uncle Miraz's castle. They join his side, but Nikabrik, the hag and the were-wolf will stop at nothing to oust Miraz, despite Caspian's warnings that the Witch was \"a hundred times worse than Miraz himself\" - they are then killed in a melee which involves Caspian, his tutor Dr Cornelius, and the returning Peter and Edmund, who have been recalled to Narnia after Caspian blows Susan's horn. On the orders of Aslan and the newly-crowned King Caspian, Narnia is now a land in which humans and talking animals are encouraged to integrate and have equal rights - although a small number of Telmarines accept Aslan's offer of building a new life for themselves on Planet Earth, on the Pacific island where their pirate descendants had entered Narnia through a cave in the early 1940s.\n\ndoc376723: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Meanwhile, Mr Beaver realises that Edmund has betrayed them, and they set off at once to seek Aslan at the Stone Table. As they travel, the Witch's spell over Narnia begins to break: Father Christmas (who has not been seen in Narnia for a hundred years) arrives with magical presents: a sword for Peter, a horn and a bow with arrows for Susan, a knife and a bottle of healing cordial for Lucy. The snow melts, and winter ends. Aslan welcomes the children and the Beavers to his camp near the Stone Table. Upon hearing Edmund's situation, he orders a rescue party of loyal Narnians.\n\ndoc73653: The Chronicles of Narnia (film series). The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, based on the novel of the same title, is the first film in the series. Directed by Andrew Adamson, it was shot mainly in New Zealand, though locations were used in Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom.\n\ndoc910359: Aslan. He is first mentioned by Mr. Beaver, who tells the Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) that \"Aslan is on the move\". He explains that Aslan is the true king of Narnia and that the children (as Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve) are the chosen ones to help end the tyrannical rule of the White Witch. Even as the children explore Narnia, Aslan's presence begins to weaken Jadis' grip on the land; the ice begins to melt and Father Christmas appears at last and gives the children gifts.\n\ndoc644998: Anna Popplewell. Her first major role was in the film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) where she played Susan Pevensie. She has a phobia of mice, which required a double to do part of her scene at the Stone Table in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.[2] She reprised her role in the sequel, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, in which she acted with William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley and Ben Barnes. The film opened in cinemas 16 May 2008. She also made a cameo appearance in the third Narnia film, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.\n\ndoc374362: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Principal photography began in New Zealand on June 28, 2004,[25] shooting in primarily chronological order.[5] Adamson did this in order to naturally create a sense of mature development from his young actors, which mirrored their real life development.[16] Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes[7] were never shown the set before filming scenes of their characters entering Narnia, nor had Henley seen James McAvoy in his Mr. Tumnus costume before shooting their scenes together.[4]\n\ndoc374367: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The soundtrack was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams. Gregson-Williams had previously worked with Adamson on Shrek (2001) and Shrek 2 (2004). In addition there are three original songs in the film; Can't Take It In by Imogen Heap, Wunderkind by Alanis Morissette and Winter Light by Tim Finn. Evanescence lead singer Amy Lee also wrote a song for the film, but it was not included in the soundtrack.[31]\n\ndoc62385: White Witch. Jadis appears in the Neil Gaiman short story \"The Problem of Susan\" which appeared in the collection \"Fragile Things\".\n\ndoc337977: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game). The player can also collect coins, which may be traded in for special moves and character upgrades, such as an increase in health.[5] The player may also mark statues of petrified heroes for Aslan to restore; this directly affects the amount of reinforcements that the player will have in the final battle against the White Witch.[4] Other bonus items can be found and collected throughout the game.[5]\n\ndoc2440544: Mr. Tumnus. Tumnus first appears when Lucy arrives in Narnia at the lamp-post. He invites her back to his cave for tea, during which, they talk about Narnia. Tumnus then plays  his flute, and Lucy falls asleep. When Lucy wakes up, she sees him in tears. He confesses that he is in the pay of the White Witch (Jadis), who rules Narnia and has made it always winter but never Christmas. She had ordered him and the other Narnians to hand over any Sons of Adam or Daughters of Eve - humans - that he sees in Narnia. Tumnus, despite knowing that the Witch will find out if he disobeys her orders, quickly realises that he can't bear to give Lucy up to the Witch, so he guides her back to the lamp-post to see that she returns safely to her own world.\n\ndoc797879: The Chronicles of Narnia. J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, has said that she was a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the influence of The Chronicles on her work: \"I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross Station\u00a0\u2014 it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts.\"[52] Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: \"Narnia is literally a different world\", she says, \"whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal.\"[52] New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until he is redeemed by Aslan.[53]\n\ndoc376729: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Fifteen years later, the four rulers chase a wish-granting white stag through the forest whereupon they rediscover the lamppost. They soon find their way not through branches but coats. They come back through the wardrobe in the Professor's house and are suddenly children again, dressed in their old clothes. Almost no time has passed in the real world, despite their many years in Narnia.\n\ndoc797907: The Chronicles of Narnia. In 1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre and musical production company, produced a musical rendition of \"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" that Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film adaptations), has openly declared that he feels is the closest to Lewis's intent. The book and lyrics were written by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Inocian, while the music was composed by Lito Villareal.[89][90]\n\ndoc325325: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. At another island, Lucy is abducted by the invisible Dufflepuds, who force her to enter the manor of the magician Coriakin to find a visibility spell. She does so, and later introduces him to her friends. Coriakin encourages the crew to defeat the mist by laying the lords' seven swords at Aslan's Table on Ramandu's island, but warns them that they are about to be tested, through temptation. Lucy recites a beauty incantation she found, and enters a dream in which she has transformed into Susan and neither Lucy nor Narnia exist. Aslan chides Lucy for her self-doubt, explaining that her siblings only know of Narnia because of her, telling her \"don't run away from who you are\".\n\ndoc62375: White Witch. A natural-born sorceress and a cunning strategist, Jadis is arrogant and cruel, considering herself above all rules and viewing others as tools to be used or obstacles to be demolished. After she eats the Fruit of Everlasting Life, selfishly and against the written admonition on the gate, she discovers that her sense of inner power and life is amplified. Her callousness and sense of entitlement is most clearly demonstrated when she uses the Deplorable Word in Charn to vanquish her sister, even though the Word would eradicate all life in that world but her own. She prefers to destroy that entire world than submit to her sister's authority, and shows afterward a remorseless pride in her actions.\n\ndoc376728: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Meanwhile, Peter and Edmund lead the Narnians against Jadis, and Edmund is seriously wounded. Aslan arrives with the former statues as reinforcements. The Narnians rout Jadis's supporters, and Aslan kills Jadis. Aslan breathes life into those Jadis has turned to stone on the battlefield, and Lucy uses her magic cordial to revive the wounded, starting with Edmund. The Pevensie children are crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel. Soon afterward, Aslan slips away and disappears.\n\ndoc797853: The Chronicles of Narnia. Tumnus is a faun who is featured prominently in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and also appears in The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle. He is close friends with Lucy and is the first creature she meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series. Lewis said that the first Narnia story came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood. In that way, Tumnus was the initial inspiration for the entire Narnia series.[29]\n\ndoc62377: White Witch. The voice of Jadis was provided by Elizabeth Counsell in Focus on the Family's radio drama versions of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Magician's Nephew. Counsell also made a cameo appearance as a lamb in The Last Battle.\n\ndoc374363: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The first scene shot was at the former RNZAF Base Hobsonville for the railway scene.[26] Afterwards, they shot the Blitz scene, which Adamson called their first formal day of shooting.[8]\n\ndoc910365: Aslan. The novel Prince Caspian takes place 1,300 Narnian years after the events in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan and the Pevensie children have become near-forgotten \"myths\", and Narnia is now ruled by Telmarines, humans who have since conquered and settled in Narnia.\n\ndoc797857: The Chronicles of Narnia. The main setting of The Chronicles of Narnia is the world of Narnia constructed by Lewis and, in The Magician's Nephew, the world containing the city of Charn. The Narnian and Charnian worlds are themselves posited as just two in a multiverse of countless worlds that includes our own universe, the main protagonists' world of origin. Passage between these worlds is possible, though rare, and may be accomplished by various means. Narnia itself is described as populated by a wide variety of creatures, most of which would be recognisable to those familiar with European mythologies and British and Irish fairy tales.\n\n"
