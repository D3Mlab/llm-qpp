Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: where does the expression go commando come from\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc11254: Going commando. The origins of the phrase \"go commando\" are uncertain, with some speculating that it may refer to being \"out in the open\" or \"ready for action\".[5]\n\ndoc11256: Going commando. The term appeared in the 1982 novel Groundrush by Greg Barron, in the sentence, \"Bigfoot's jock snapped underneath, leaving him to 'go commando'.\"[9] In the Chicago Tribune of January 22, 1985, Jim Spencer wrote, \"Furthermore, coloured briefs are 'sleazy' and going without underwear ('going commando', as they say on campus) is simply gross.\" The term gained currency in the popular vernacular after appearing in a 1996 episode of Friends.[10][11]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc2546828: Go-go dancing. The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops. A synonym used in Vietnam for go-go dancers is \"table dancer\".\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\ndoc194221: Ratchet & Clank. Going Commando (also known as Locked and Loaded in Europe and Ratchet & Clank 2 in Japan) was released on November 11, 2003 in North America for the PlayStation 2.\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\ndoc2551122: Gout. The term  \"gout\" was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 AD. It is derived from the Latin word gutta, meaning \"a drop\" (of liquid).[82] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is derived from humorism and \"the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints\".[83]\n\ndoc2546827: Go-go dancing. Go-go dancers are dancers who are employed to entertain crowds at nightclubs[1] or other venues where music is played. Go-go dancing originated in the early 1960s, by some accounts when women at the Peppermint Lounge in New York City began to get up on tables and dance the twist.[2] Some claim that go-go dancing originated at, and was named after, the very popular Los Angeles rock club Whisky a Go Go which opened in January 1964, but the opposite may be true \u2013 the club chose the name to reflect the already popular craze of go-go dancing.[3] Many 1960s-era clubgoers wore miniskirts and knee-high, high-heeled boots, which eventually came to be called go-go boots. Night club promoters in the mid\u20111960s then conceived the idea of hiring women dressed in these outfits to entertain patrons.\n\ndoc2110662: Go go bar. The term go-go bar is often used for certain sorts of strip clubs. In regions where the term is used, go-go bars are considered lower in class when compared to gentlemen's clubs, which offer a more coordinated and show-centric experience. In these bars:\n\ndoc2110661: Go go bar. The term go-go bar originally referred to a nightclub, bar, or similar establishment that featured Go-Go dancers; while some Go-go bars in that original sense still exist, the link between its present uses and that original meaning is often more tenuous and regional. Speaking broadly, the term has been used by venues that cover a wide range of businesses, from nightclubs or discotheques, where dancers are essentially there to set the mood, to what are in essence burlesque theaters or strip clubs, where dancers are part of a show and the primary focus.\n\ndoc2110664: Go go bar. The origin of the term go-go dancing goes back to a British film of the 1950s \u201cWhiskey Galore\u201d. This film tells the story of the sinking of a ship loaded with whiskey. The French title of this film was \"Whiskey \u00e0 Go-Go\u201d; go-go being the French expression for \"galore\". During the period that this film was showing in France, discotheques were just introduced as a new form of entertainment. Due to the success of the film and the snob appeal of drinking whiskey in France, a number of discotheques were given the name \u201cWhiskey \u00e0 Go-Go\u201d. It was also the time when dances became popular, where partners were dancing apart from each other. Not long after the success of the discotheques in France, they were opened in French style in New York City, with the same name as their French example: \u201cWhiskey A Go-Go\u201d. American discos introduced soon a form of entertainment of young girls dancing in the new, loose style, without a partner. The go-go dancer was born.[1]\n\ndoc169372: Glossary of French expressions in English. chacun \u00e0 son go\u00fbt\n\ndoc2206833: Breeching (boys). Goya, 1784.

Since the early 1960s, many men's  magazines featured images of women in underwear, with models in suspenders and stocking, often with slips, petticoats, corsets or a bra and knickers or panties in erotic pose.\nThese images may have an erotic element and are sometimes presented as fetish fashion and also in pornography.\n\ndoc607482: The Go-Go's. They were formed as a punk band and had roots in the L.A. punk community.[7] They shared a rehearsal space with the Motels and Carlisle, under the name \"Dottie Danger\", had briefly been a member of punk rock band the Germs. Due to a bout of mononucleosis, she left the Germs before playing a gig.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts.

In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc1047884: 1990s in fashion. Go-go boots became fashionable again in 1995. They were worn by women of the hip-hop and preppy subcultures.\n\ndoc361901: The show must go on. There is no evidence to suggest that it is the abbreviation of a longer phrase. The saying and principle are traditional in the theater, but they both originated in the 19th century with circuses. If an animal got loose or a performer was injured, the ringmaster and the band tried to keep things going so that the crowd would not panic[1] because \"it is a point of honour not to let the other players down by deserting them when no understudy is available.\"[2]\n\ndoc484960: Pantsula. It developed from the Sotho dances of mqaquanga and marabi, with influence from 1930s American jazz.[3] Later evolutions of pantsula dancing in the 1980s were influenced by American hip hop and breakdance.[2] Quick, darting steps in geometric lines with an uneven rhythmic quality characterize this form of movement. The Charleston, a knock-kneed manoeuvre from American jazz, as well as the popping and locking found in US hip hop, are also found in this form of dance. The word pantsula is Zulu, and refers to \"waddling like a duck.\" This flat-footed move with the buttocks sticking out is commonplace in the dance form.[4]\n\ndoc710215: Wu-Tang Clan. \"I'm going to bring out Dirty Wear,\" declared ODB. \"A set of ready-worn clothes: 'Dirty Wear, for the girl who likes to wear her panties three days in a row.'\"[99]\n\ndoc543913: Trousers. During the French Revolution, male citizens of France adopted a working-class costume including ankle-length trousers, or pantaloons (from a Commedia dell'Arte character named Pantalone)[33] in place of the aristocratic knee-breeches. The new garment of the revolutionaries differed from that of the ancien regime upper classes in three ways: it was loose where the style for breeches had most recently been form-fitting, it was ankle length where breeches had generally been knee-length for more than two centuries, and they were open at the bottom while breeches were fastened. Pantaloons became fashionable in early 19th-century England and the Regency era. The style was introduced by Beau Brummell[34][35][36] and by mid-century had supplanted breeches as fashionable street wear.[37] At this point, even knee-length pants adopted the open bottoms of trousers (see shorts) and were worn by young boys, for sports, and in tropical climates. Breeches proper survived into the 20th century as court dress, and also in baggy mid-calf (or three-quarter length) versions known as plus-fours or knickers worn for active sports and by young schoolboys. Types of breeches are still worn today by baseball and American football players.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc1118414: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Ghosts (\u30b4\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8, G\u014dsuto)\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc2363615: The Go-Go's (British band). The single tried to turn the sinister Daleks into another version of the Chipmunks, with singer Sue Smith putting on a lisping childlike voice. Songwriter and record producer Les Vandyke (working under the pseudonym of Johnny Worth) was largely responsible for the track. Other musicians were Mike Johnson, Alan Cairns, Abe Harris, Bill Davison and Les McLeian.[2]\n\ndoc879219: Geordie. Howay is broadly comparable to the invocation \"Come on!\" or the French \"Allez-y!\" (\"Go on!\"). Examples of common use include Howay man!, meaning \"come on\" or \"hurry up\", Howay the lads! as a term of encouragement for a sports team for example (the players' tunnel at St James' Park has this phrase just above the entrance to the pitch), or Ho'way!? (with stress on the second syllable) expressing incredulity or disbelief.[47] The literal opposite of this phrase is haddaway (\"go away\"); although not as common as howay, it is perhaps most commonly used in the phrase \"Haddaway an' shite\" (Tom Hadaway, Figure 5.2 Haddaway an' shite; 'Cursing like sleet blackening the buds, raging at the monk of Jarrow scribbling his morality and judgement into a book.'[48]).\n\ndoc2206819: Breeching (boys). The skeleton suit consisted of trousers and tight-fitting jacket, buttoned together at the waist or higher up; they were not unlike the romper suit introduced in the early 20th century.[13] But dresses for boys did not disappear, and again became common from the 1820s, when they were worn at about knee-length, sometimes with visible pantaloons called pantalettes as underwear, a style also worn by little girls.\n\ndoc1118411: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Kneesocks (\u30cb\u30fc\u30bd\u30c3\u30af\u30b9, N\u012bsokkusu)\n\ndoc2117300: History of games. Go, also known as Weiqi, Igo, or Baduk (in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, respectively), is first mentioned in the historical annal Zuo Zhuan[27] (c. 4th century BC[28]). It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the Analects of Confucius[28] and in two of the books of Mencius[29] (c. 3rd century BC[28]). In ancient China, Go was one of the four cultivated arts of the Chinese scholar gentleman, along with calligraphy, painting and playing the musical instrument guqin, and examinations of skill in those arts was used to qualify candidates for service in the bureaucracy. Go was brought to Korea in the second century BC when the Han Dynasty expanded into the Korean peninsula and it arrived in Japan in the 5th or 6th century AD and it quickly became a favorite aristocratic pastime.\n\ndoc2546834: Go-go dancing. Many gay clubs had male go-go dancers, often called go-go boys, from 1965 to 1968, after which few gay clubs had go-go dancers until 1988, when go-go dancing again became fashionable at gay clubs (and has remained so ever since). Nowadays, gay male go-go dancers are a lot more popular and common in American culture, especially in bigger cities such as Los Angeles and New York. In fact, there are more gay go-go dancers than female go-go dancers in today's club scene, a big turnaround from the 60's. [7][8]\n\ndoc2472272: Whisky a Go Go. The Whisky a Go Go was one of the places that popularized go-go dancing. Elmer Valentine, in a 2006 Vanity Fair article, recalled arranging to have a female DJ play records between Rivers' sets so patrons could continue dancing. But because there was not enough room on the floor for a DJ booth, he had a glass-walled booth mounted high above the floor.[8][10] A contest was held for the female DJ job but when the young winner called Valentine on the night of the opening and tearfully said her mother forbade her from doing it, Valentine recruited the club's cigarette girl, Patty Brockhurst. Valentine quickly hired two more female dancers, one of whom, Joanna Labean, designed the official go-go-girl costume of fringed dress and white boots.[10]\n\ndoc1751688: Miniskirt. The very short skirt is an element of Japanese school uniform, which since the 1990s has been exploited by young women who are part of the kogal (or gyaru) subculture as part of their look.[54] Gyaru deliberately wear their skirts short enough to reveal panties (actually a second pair worn over actual knickers) as a form of exhibitionism known as panchira.[55]\n\ndoc826515: Kum & Go. The Kum & Go name was adopted in 1975[5] to unify the company's array of stores under a single brand. It was a play on the phrase \"come and go\" using the initials of founders Krause and Gentle. Sales of Kum & Go-branded merchandise increased after Johnny Knoxville was seen wearing a Kum & Go T-shirt during a scene in the 2006 movie Jackass Number Two.[6]\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc753095: Order of the Garter. Various legends account for the origin of the Order. The most popular involves the \"Countess of Salisbury\", whose garter is said to have slipped from her leg while she was dancing at a court ball at Calais. When the surrounding courtiers sniggered, the king picked it up and returned it to her, exclaiming, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense!\" (\"Shame on him who thinks ill of it!\"), the phrase that has become the motto of the Order.[1]\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc145348: Roaring Twenties. The 1920s was a period of social revolution, coming out of World War I, society changed as inhibitions faded and youth demanded new experiences and more freedom from old controls. Chaperones faded in importance as \"anything goes\" became a slogan for youth taking control of their subculture.[68] A new woman was born\u00e2\u20ac\u201da \"flapper\" who danced, drank, smoked and voted. This new woman cut her hair, wore make-up, and partied. She was known for being giddy and taking risks; she was known as a flapper.[69] Women gained the right to vote in most countries. New careers opened for single women in offices and schools, with salaries that helped them to be more independent.[70] With their desire for freedom and independence came change in fashion.[71] One of the most dramatic post-war changes in fashion was the woman's silhouette; the dress length went from floor length to ankle and knee length, becoming more bold and seductive. The new dress code emphasized youth: corsets were left behind and clothing was looser, with more natural lines. The hourglass figure was not popular anymore, whereas a slimmer, boyish body type was considered appealing. The flappers were known for this and for their high spirits, flirtatiousness, and stereotypical recklessness when it came to their search for fun and thrills.[72]\n\ndoc696946: Green beret. No. 2 Commando and No. 9 Commando faced with the same problem had adopted the Tam o' Shanter, but, as a traditional Scottish headdress, this was not considered suitable for what was a British unit. After some discussion it was agreed that if No. 1 Commando was to adopt a uniformed headdress then the beret, which had been worn by the Tank Regiment since the First World War (and had recently been adopted by the Parachute Regiment), would meet the requirements: it had no British regional affinity, it was difficult to wear improperly, and it could be easily stowed away without damage (when for example tin hats were in use).[2]\n\ndoc1730418: 1980s in Western fashion. Parachute pants are a style of trousers characterized by the use of ripstop nylon or extremely baggy cuts. In the original tight-fitting, extraneously zippered style of the late 1970s and early 1980s, \"parachute\" referred to the pants' synthetic nylon material. In the later 1980s, \"parachute\" may have referred to the extreme bagginess of the pant. These are also referred to as \"Hammer\" pants, due to rapper MC Hammer's signature style. Hammer pants differ from the parachute pants of the 1970s and early 1980s. They are typically worn as menswear and are often brightly colored. Parachute pants became a fad in US culture in the 1980s as part of an increased cultural appropriation of breakdancing.[51]\n\ndoc2362370: Sanitary napkin. Later an adhesive strip was placed on the bottom of the pad for attachment to the crotch of the panties, and this became a favoured method with women. The belted sanitary napkin quickly disappeared during the early 1980s.\n\ndoc676772: Victoria's Secret. The company drew criticism for a newly released lingerie collection titled \"Go East\" whose tagline pledged to women the capacity to \"indulge in touches of eastern delight with lingerie inspired by the exquisite beauty of secret Japanese gardens.\"[83][211] The collection included a mesh teddy \"Sexy Little Geisha\" featuring \"flirty cutouts and Eastern-inspired florals\".\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc2446360: Goggles. Goggles are often worn as a fashion statement in certain subcultures, most often as part of the cybergoth subculture. They are usually worn over the eyes or up on the forehead to secure 'falls': a type of long, often brightly coloured, synthetic hairpiece. Fans of the steampunk genre or subculture also frequently wear steampunk-styled goggles, particularly when performing in a live action role-playing game.\n\ndoc220823: 442nd Infantry Regiment (United States). In post-war American popular slang, the phrase \"going for broke\" was adopted from the 442nd's unit motto \"Go for Broke\", which was derived from the Hawaiian pidgin phrase used by craps shooters risking all their money on one roll of the dice.[4]:69\n\ndoc54244: Jeep. (Jeepster) Commando\n\ndoc2546833: Go-go dancing. The tradition of go-go dancers on TV music shows continues around the world, such as the Viva Hotbabes and SexBomb Girls in the Philippines. However, while American shows of the 1960s featured dancers highly trained in the various choreography used in each show, many modern dancers are not so closely choreographed.\n\ndoc473901: Jeep Wrangler. The Commando Jeep is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tactical vehicle based on the Jeep Wrangler with a factory installed turbodiesel engine operating on JP-8 and global diesel fuels.[43] It is a vehicle modified for use by airborne forces, special operations forces, and combat engineers.\n\ndoc2546836: Go-go dancing. Not very many nightclubs had go-go dancers in the 1970s. However, in the late 1970s, there was a nightclub at 128 West 45th Street (the same location where the Peppermint Lounge had been) in Manhattan, New York City, called G.\u00a0G.\u00a0Barnum's Room, patronized mostly by transsexuals, that had male go-go dancers who danced on trapezes above a net over the dance floor.[9][10] In 1978, the Xenon night club in Manhattan became the first night club to provide go-go boxes for amateur go-go dancers to dance on.[11]\n\ndoc2050177: Long underwear. In 2004, Michael Quinion, a British etymologist and writer, postulated that the \"john\" in the item of apparel may be a reference to Sullivan, who wore a similar-looking garment in the ring. This explanation, however, is uncertain and the term's origin is ultimately unknown.[2] So it is also very probable that it's simply a deformation of \"longues jambes\" meaning \"long leg\" in French.\n\ndoc2050172: Long underwear. Long underwear, also called long johns or thermal underwear, is a style of two-piece underwear with long legs and long sleeves that is normally worn during cold weather. It is commonly worn by people under their clothes in cold countries.\n\ndoc435360: Break a leg. There are several theories behind the origin of the phrase. Few are supported by contemporary writings. The theories listed below are some of the more popular explanations.\n\ndoc1118409: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Chuck (\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af, Chakku)\n\ndoc1079523: Funk. Go-go originated in the Washington, D.C. area with which it remains associated, along with other spots in the Mid-Atlantic. Inspired by singers such as Chuck Brown, the \"Godfather of Go-go\", it is a blend of funk, rhythm and blues, and early hip hop, with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and in-person jamming in place of dance tracks.  As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience call and response.  Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion.\n\ndoc1118413: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Fastener (\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30ca\u30fc, Fasun\u0101)\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc2542970: Tightrope walking. Tightrope walking, also called funambulism, is the skill of walking along a thin wire or rope. It has a long tradition in various countries and is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include slack rope walking and slacklining.\n\ndoc2654995: Bikini. By the 1960s, the bikini swimsuit influenced panty styles and coincided with the cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants.[224] In the seventies, with the emergence of skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline and the rise of the leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear[225]). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure.[224] From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts.[226] Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness.[226] Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.[227]\n\ndoc692753: Let's Go All the Way (song). A music video received heavy airplay on MTV and is credited with greatly adding to the \"infectious\" song's success.[1] The video juxtaposes three distinct modes. First straightforward and color negative studio performance of the duo dancing, emoting, and performing along with the song in a bright pop-art style. This is interspersed with shots of an interracial pair of young boys engaged in various activities, predominantly picking toy weapons of war out of a shopping cart and smashing them with hammers on an anvil, as news footage is projected on a white backdrop. In other shots they march and stagger about dressed in combat fatigues and cavorting in sunglasses and surfer jams. The third thread consists of depression-era black & white clips from slapstick comedies and footage of factory workers. An atomic bomb blast is seen in reverse. The video ends with the two children in normal garb walking up to a large globe, picking the world up and carrying it.[2]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc34871: Basketball moves. \"Give and Go\" is an offensive play that involves passing the ball (give) and then running (go) to an open spot to receive the ball back, usually near the basket, for an easy score. This play can be effective when the defender pays too much attention to the ball instead of the player who moves after passing the ball. This is also known as a \"One-Two\" in street ball.\n\ndoc1564132: British slang. knees-up\u00c2\n\ndoc2266477: Flapper. The use of the term coincided with a fashion among teenage girls in the United States in the early 1920s for wearing unbuckled galoshes,[22] and a widespread false etymology held that they were called \"flappers\" because they flapped when they walked, as they wore their overshoes or galoshes unfastened, showing that they defied convention in a manner similar to the 21st century fad for untied shoelaces.[23][24] Another suggestion to the origin of the term, in relation to fashion, comes from a 1920s fashion trend in which young women left their overcoat unbuttoned to allow it to flap back and forth as they walked, appearing more independent and freed from the tight, Victorian Era style clothing.[25]\n\ndoc995323: Going Dutch. The Oxford English Dictionary connects \"go Dutch\" and \"Dutch treat\" to other phrases which have \"an opprobrious or derisive application, largely due to the rivalry and enmity between the English and Dutch in the 17th century\", the period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Another example is \"Dutch courage\".[1]\n\ndoc2619602: Go/no go gauge. A go-no gauge (or go/no-go) refers to an inspection tool used to check a workpiece against its allowed tolerances.  Its name is derived from two tests: the check involves the workpiece having to pass one test (go) and fail the other (no-go).\n\ndoc2363616: The Go-Go's (British band). The song was originally released as one of the many products fueling Dalekmania but as the craze fizzled out the song was largely forgotten, with snippets occasionally appearing in Doctor Who anthological products. It resurfaced in its entirety on the October 2000 album, Who Is Dr Who.[3]\n\ndoc696943: Green beret. The green beret was the official headdress of the British Commandos of the Second World War. It is still worn by members of the Royal Marines after passing the Commando Course and personnel from other units of the Royal Navy, Army and RAF who serve within 3 Commando Brigade and who have passed the All Arms Commando Course.\n\ndoc512471: Anything Goes (Cole Porter song). \"Anything Goes\" is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical Anything Goes (1934). Many of the lyrics feature humorous references[1] to various figures of scandal and gossip in Depression-era high society. For example, one couplet refers to Sam Goldwyn's notorious box-office failure Nana, which featured a star, Anna Sten, whose English was said to be incomprehensible to all except Goldwyn, who came from Eastern Europe (Goldwyn was from Poland and Sten Ukraine).[2] Other 1930s society references include film producer Max Gordon, socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean and her highly promoted trip to the Russian SFSR, interior design pioneer Lady Mendl's scandalous predilection for performing hand stands and cartwheels in public at the age of 70, and the financial woes common to \"old money\" families during the Depression, such as the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and Whitneys.\n\ndoc1118405: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Panty (\u30d1\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3, Panti)\n\ndoc891390: OK. Numerous explanations for the origin of the expression have been suggested, but few have been discussed seriously by linguists. The following proposals have found mainstream recognition.\n\ndoc741193: Ninja. Clothing used was similar to that of the samurai, but loose garments (such as leggings) were tucked into trousers or secured with belts. The tenugui, a piece of cloth also used in martial arts, had many functions. It could be used to cover the face, form a belt, or assist in climbing.\n\ndoc2332785: Royal Marines. Each Commando Unit will rotate through one of three roles every six months.\n\ndoc1704953: Lambeau Field. The \"Go Pack Go\" jingle is usually played when the team is on defense or during the start of a drive on offense. A song built around this jingle is \"Go Pack Go!\" by The 6 Packers.\n\ndoc1296244: Piss Up a Rope. When asked about the lyrics \"You can wash my balls with a warm wet rag\" and \"On your knees, you big bootied bitch,\" Dean Ween stated that he wrote the song for his wife. The inspiration for the title came from his father: \"[It is] a funny expression that I copped from my dad. When I was a kid, he used to say, 'Aw, go piss up a rope.' It was just nonsense. It was like, 'Aw, go shit in your hat' or whatever.\"[1]\n\ndoc1990418: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. In a press release, April reads a note from Perry, thanking the turtles for saving him, and when they return home, they deny being seen by the humans, but Splinter holds up the evening's newspaper on which they are plastered across the cover. He then orders the four of them to do flips as punishment, chanting the theme song they were dancing to at the club \"Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go!\" exclaiming he \"made another funny\" as the scene freezes.\n\ndoc2546830: Go-go dancing. Go-go dancers began to be hired on a regular basis at the Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood in the Los Angeles area in July 1965. The Whisky a Go Go was also the first go-go club to have go-go cages suspended from the ceiling (they were there from the very beginning in 1965), and thus the profession of cage dancer was born.\n\ndoc2542974: Tightrope walking. The word funambulism or the phrase \"walking a tightrope\" is also used in a metaphorical setting not referring to any actual acrobatic acts. For instance, politicians are said to \"walk a tightrope\" when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The term can also be used in satirical or acidic contexts. Nicholas Taleb uses the phrase in his book The Black Swan. \"You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports\". Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.[14]\n\ndoc1118412: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Corset (\u30b3\u30eb\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8, Korusetto)\n\ndoc2110663: Go go bar. In Southeast Asia, and particularly in Thailand and parts of the Philippines, Go Go bars can include a wide variety of indoor bars with dancers and/or hostesses; these typically do not offer striptease. These are most often venues for prostitution, and the dancers are usually available to be bar fined by customers. These are often, but not exclusively, found in red light districts catering to foreigners.\n\ndoc1085603: T-shirt. The T-shirt evolved from undergarments used in the 19th century. First, the one-piece union suit underwear was cut into separate top and bottom garments, with the top long enough to tuck under the waistband of the bottoms. With and without buttons, they were adopted by miners and stevedores during the late 19th century as a convenient covering for hot environments.\n\ndoc2546840: Go-go dancing. Go-go dancers that are hired to dance at night clubs, special parties, festivals, circuit parties or rave dances in bright, colorful costumes are called performance art dancers.[13] Their costumes often include accessories such as glow sticks, light chasers, toy ray guns that light up, go-go shorts embedded with battery-operated fiber optic tubes in various colors, strings of battery-operated colored lights in plastic tubes, fire sticks, a musical instrument, or an animal (usually a snake). In the early to mid\u00e2\u20ac\u20181980s, the performance art dancer John Sex, who performed with a python, played a role in making go-go dancing popular once again at gay and bisexual night clubs along with his life partner Sebastian Kwok.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2079875: 1920s in Western fashion. Undergarments began to transform after World War I to conform to the ideals of a flatter chest and more boyish figure.The female figure was liberated from the restrictive corset, and newly popular the boyish look was achieved through the use of bust bodices. Some of the new pieces included chemises, thin camisoles, and cami-knickers, later shortened to panties or knickers. These were primarily made from rayon and came in soft, light colors in order to be worn under semi-transparent fabrics.[12] Young flappers took to these styles of underwear due to the ability to move more freely and the increased comfort when dancing to the high tempo jazz music. During the mid-1920s, all-in-one lingerie became popular.\n\ndoc406101: Brand New Key. Many listeners[citation needed] detect sexual innuendo in the lyrics, with the key in its lock thought to symbolize sexual intercourse, or in phrases such as \"I go pretty far\" and \"I've been all around the world\". Another common viewpoint on the song, is that the song is clearly an innocent reflection upon the typical workings of a child's mind regarding their possessions (In this case, quad skates and the associated key essential for tightening/loosening a locking clamp on the skates).\n\ndoc1925969: Swim briefs. A swim brief or racing brief is any briefs-style male swimsuit such as those worn in competitive swimming and diving. The popularity of the Australian Speedo brand racing brief has led to the use of its name in many countries around the world (e.g. the United States, New Zealand, UK and Europe) to refer to any racing brief, regardless of the maker. Occasionally, the Speedo genericized trademark also applies to square cut swimsuit, but in general the generic term is used in reference to swim briefs. Swim briefs are also referred to as competition briefs, swimming trunks, bathers, racer bathers, posing briefs, racing briefs, and colloquially in Australia as \"budgie smugglers\".[1]\n\ndoc182137: Shorts. Short trousers, terminating three to four inches above the knee, commonly worn by men in Bermuda (with knee-socks and a blazer and tie) for business attire and even at cocktail parties.[13][14] They are available in a wide range of colors, ranging from conservative grey and navy, to brighter hues such as orange, green and pink.[14] Despite their name, they are not of Bermudian origin, but were originally designed around 1900 for military wear by the British armed forces in tropical climates.[14] From the 1920s onwards these military uniform shorts began to be copied by Bermudian tailors and civilians, and were subsequently taken up by tourists who spread the style around the world.[14] The tourists who appropriated the style wore Bermuda shorts almost exclusively as casual wear.[14]\n\ndoc2355569: Jeep Wrangler (JK). The Commando Jeep is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tactical vehicle based on the Jeep Wrangler with a factory installed turbodiesel engine operating on JP-8 and global diesel fuels.[24]  It is a vehicle modified for use by airborne forces, special operations forces, and combat engineers.\n\ndoc1632017: Go Where You Wanna Go. The British group The Bees recorded \"Go Where You Wanna Go\" for a digital-only release in February 2011. Their version was used in the UK 'Travelodge' TV advert.\n\ndoc537830: Days Go By (Dirty Vegas song). The music video for the song is unusual in that it largely consists of two dancers representing one character performing a routine of popping, locking, the robot and breakdancing. The performance occurs in front of Chroni's Famous Sandwich Shop in East Los Angeles, California, and tells the story of a dancer who shows up once a year and dances all day from sunrise to sunset. He dances in hopes of bringing back a lost love, who left him because he couldn't stop dancing. (The video even halts abruptly while some of the bystanders interject what they think happened to the aforementioned love.) The young dancer in the video is Garland Spencer. The older dancer is Byron McIntyre. The clue that both men represent the same character at different ages is provided by the dancer's shoes. The older dancer wears high-top Converse sneakers (\"Chuck Taylor All-Stars\" or \"Chucks\") that are faded, scuffed, and one shoe is actually taped to hold it together; whereas the young dancer wears a clean, bright-orange version of the same sneakers. According to the video's story, the man's lost love purchased the original sneakers for him as a gift, and now he wears them as part of his annual dance ritual. The sneakers match the style and attire of the young dancer in his sweatsuit (presumably in the 1980s), but pose a striking contrast for the older dancer who is otherwised attired in a suit, tie, and suspenders.\n\ndoc516028: Go West, young man. Some sources[who?] have claimed the phrase is derived from Greeley's July 13, 1865 editorial in the New York Tribune, but this text does not appear in that issue of the newspaper.[citation needed] The actual editorial instead encourages American Civil War veterans to take advantage of the Homestead Act and colonize the public lands:\n\ndoc1564099: British slang. Some slang was developed because of a need for secrecy, such as prison slang, believed to be derived from thieves cant,[11] and Polari, a variety used by homosexuals in Britain and the United Kingdom. Homosexuality was a crime until 1967 and Polari has a history going back at least a hundred years.[12] Sometimes the purpose of slang is to cause offence, insults such as wanker or gobshite for example; and sometimes the purpose is to prevent it by substituting a slang word for the offensive one, berk (rhyming slang for cunt) for example.[13] Sometimes a Spoonerism, is employed to make taboo speech more acceptable. For example: Cupid stunt and Betty Swallocks.[14]\n\ndoc1604526: Tony Gordon. In the media, specifically in the UK, he was given the humorous nickname of 'Toe Knee Gore-Don', a name which has since become synonymous with the character.\n\ndoc1921370: Going to a Go-Go. Going to a Go-Go was reissued on CD in 2002, coupled with the Miracles' Away We a Go-Go.\n\ndoc1921374: Going to a Go-Go. Going to a Go-Go was reissued on CD in 2002, coupled with the Miracles' Away We a Go-Go.\n\ndoc2546841: Go-go dancing. In Russia, in the 2013 elections the Civilian Power party put forward four female go-go dancers as candidates for deputies.[14][15]\n\ndoc543916: Trousers. The Korean word for trousers, baji (originally pajibaji) first appears in recorded history around the turn of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at least this time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined gouei to the padded sombaji.[38]\n\n"

The origins of the phrase \"go commando\" are uncertain, with some speculating that it may refer to being \"out in the open\" or \"ready for action\".[5]\n\ndoc11256: Going commando. The term appeared in the 1982 novel Groundrush by Greg Barron, in the sentence, \"Bigfoot's jock snapped underneath, leaving him to 'go commando'.\"[9] In the Chicago Tribune of January 22, 1985, Jim Spencer wrote, \"Furthermore, coloured briefs are 'sleazy' and going without underwear ('going commando', as they say on campus) is simply gross.\" The term gained currency in the popular vernacular after appearing in a 1996 episode of Friends.[10][11]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc2546828: Go-go dancing. The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops. A synonym used in Vietnam for go-go dancers is \"table dancer\".\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\ndoc194221: Ratchet & Clank. Going Commando (also known as Locked and Loaded in Europe and Ratchet & Clank 2 in Japan) was released on November 11, 2003 in North America for the PlayStation 2.\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\ndoc2551122: Gout. The term  \"gout\" was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 AD. It is derived from the Latin word gutta, meaning \"a drop\" (of liquid).[82] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is derived from humorism and \"the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints\".[83]\n\ndoc2546827: Go-go dancing. Go-go dancers are dancers who are employed to entertain crowds at nightclubs[1] or other venues where music is played. Go-go dancing originated in the early 1960s, by some accounts when women at the Peppermint Lounge in New York City began to get up on tables and dance the twist.[2] Some claim that go-go dancing originated at, and was named after, the very popular Los Angeles rock club Whisky a Go Go which opened in January 1964, but the opposite may be true \u2013 the club chose the name to reflect the already popular craze of go-go dancing.[3] Many 1960s-era clubgoers wore miniskirts and knee-high, high-heeled boots, which eventually came to be called go-go boots. Night club promoters in the mid\u20111960s then conceived the idea of hiring women dressed in these outfits to entertain patrons.\n\ndoc2110662: Go go bar. The term go-go bar is often used for certain sorts of strip clubs. In regions where the term is used, go-go bars are considered lower in class when compared to gentlemen's clubs, which offer a more coordinated and show-centric experience. In these bars:\n\ndoc2110661: Go go bar. The term go-go bar originally referred to a nightclub, bar, or similar establishment that featured Go-Go dancers; while some Go-go bars in that original sense still exist, the link between its present uses and that original meaning is often more tenuous and regional. Speaking broadly, the term has been used by venues that cover a wide range of businesses, from nightclubs or discotheques, where dancers are essentially there to set the mood, to what are in essence burlesque theaters or strip clubs, where dancers are part of a show and the primary focus.\n\ndoc2110664: Go go bar. The origin of the term go-go dancing goes back to a British film of the 1950s \u201cWhiskey Galore\u201d. This film tells the story of the sinking of a ship loaded with whiskey. The French title of this film was \"Whiskey \u00e0 Go-Go\u201d; go-go being the French expression for \"galore\". During the period that this film was showing in France, discotheques were just introduced as a new form of entertainment. Due to the success of the film and the snob appeal of drinking whiskey in France, a number of discotheques were given the name \u201cWhiskey \u00e0 Go-Go\u201d. It was also the time when dances became popular, where partners were dancing apart from each other. Not long after the success of the discotheques in France, they were opened in French style in New York City, with the same name as their French example: \u201cWhiskey A Go-Go\u201d. American discos introduced soon a form of entertainment of young girls dancing in the new, loose style, without a partner. The go-go dancer was born.[1]\n\ndoc169372: Glossary of French expressions in English. chacun \u00e0 son go\u00fbt\n\ndoc2206833: Breeching (boys). Goya, 1784. A skeleton suit or similar outfit.\n\ndoc1426156: Garter (stockings). Since the early 1960s, many men's  magazines featured images of women in underwear, with models in suspenders and stocking, often with slips, petticoats, corsets or a bra and knickers or panties in erotic pose.\nThese images may have an erotic element and are sometimes presented as fetish fashion and also in pornography.\n\ndoc607482: The Go-Go's. They were formed as a punk band and had roots in the L.A. punk community.[7] They shared a rehearsal space with the Motels and Carlisle, under the name \"Dottie Danger\", had briefly been a member of punk rock band the Germs. Due to a bout of mononucleosis, she left the Germs before playing a gig.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts. Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc1047884: 1990s in fashion. Go-go boots became fashionable again in 1995. They were worn by women of the hip-hop and preppy subcultures.\n\ndoc361901: The show must go on. There is no evidence to suggest that it is the abbreviation of a longer phrase. The saying and principle are traditional in the theater, but they both originated in the 19th century with circuses. If an animal got loose or a performer was injured, the ringmaster and the band tried to keep things going so that the crowd would not panic[1] because \"it is a point of honour not to let the other players down by deserting them when no understudy is available.\"[2]\n\ndoc484960: Pantsula. It developed from the Sotho dances of mqaquanga and marabi, with influence from 1930s American jazz.[3] Later evolutions of pantsula dancing in the 1980s were influenced by American hip hop and breakdance.[2] Quick, darting steps in geometric lines with an uneven rhythmic quality characterize this form of movement. The Charleston, a knock-kneed manoeuvre from American jazz, as well as the popping and locking found in US hip hop, are also found in this form of dance. The word pantsula is Zulu, and refers to \"waddling like a duck.\" This flat-footed move with the buttocks sticking out is commonplace in the dance form.[4]\n\ndoc710215: Wu-Tang Clan. \"I'm going to bring out Dirty Wear,\" declared ODB. \"A set of ready-worn clothes: 'Dirty Wear, for the girl who likes to wear her panties three days in a row.'\"[99]\n\ndoc543913: Trousers. During the French Revolution, male citizens of France adopted a working-class costume including ankle-length trousers, or pantaloons (from a Commedia dell'Arte character named Pantalone)[33] in place of the aristocratic knee-breeches. The new garment of the revolutionaries differed from that of the ancien regime upper classes in three ways: it was loose where the style for breeches had most recently been form-fitting, it was ankle length where breeches had generally been knee-length for more than two centuries, and they were open at the bottom while breeches were fastened. Pantaloons became fashionable in early 19th-century England and the Regency era. The style was introduced by Beau Brummell[34][35][36] and by mid-century had supplanted breeches as fashionable street wear.[37] At this point, even knee-length pants adopted the open bottoms of trousers (see shorts) and were worn by young boys, for sports, and in tropical climates. Breeches proper survived into the 20th century as court dress, and also in baggy mid-calf (or three-quarter length) versions known as plus-fours or knickers worn for active sports and by young schoolboys. Types of breeches are still worn today by baseball and American football players.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc1118414: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Ghosts (\u30b4\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8, G\u014dsuto)\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc2363615: The Go-Go's (British band). The single tried to turn the sinister Daleks into another version of the Chipmunks, with singer Sue Smith putting on a lisping childlike voice. Songwriter and record producer Les Vandyke (working under the pseudonym of Johnny Worth) was largely responsible for the track. Other musicians were Mike Johnson, Alan Cairns, Abe Harris, Bill Davison and Les McLeian.[2]\n\ndoc879219: Geordie. Howay is broadly comparable to the invocation \"Come on!\" or the French \"Allez-y!\" (\"Go on!\"). Examples of common use include Howay man!, meaning \"come on\" or \"hurry up\", Howay the lads! as a term of encouragement for a sports team for example (the players' tunnel at St James' Park has this phrase just above the entrance to the pitch), or Ho'way!? (with stress on the second syllable) expressing incredulity or disbelief.[47] The literal opposite of this phrase is haddaway (\"go away\"); although not as common as howay, it is perhaps most commonly used in the phrase \"Haddaway an' shite\" (Tom Hadaway, Figure 5.2 Haddaway an' shite; 'Cursing like sleet blackening the buds, raging at the monk of Jarrow scribbling his morality and judgement into a book.'[48]).\n\ndoc2206819: Breeching (boys). The skeleton suit consisted of trousers and tight-fitting jacket, buttoned together at the waist or higher up; they were not unlike the romper suit introduced in the early 20th century.[13] But dresses for boys did not disappear, and again became common from the 1820s, when they were worn at about knee-length, sometimes with visible pantaloons called pantalettes as underwear, a style also worn by little girls.\n\ndoc1118411: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Kneesocks (\u30cb\u30fc\u30bd\u30c3\u30af\u30b9, N\u012bsokkusu)\n\ndoc2117300: History of games. Go, also known as Weiqi, Igo, or Baduk (in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, respectively), is first mentioned in the historical annal Zuo Zhuan[27] (c. 4th century BC[28]). It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the Analects of Confucius[28] and in two of the books of Mencius[29] (c. 3rd century BC[28]). In ancient China, Go was one of the four cultivated arts of the Chinese scholar gentleman, along with calligraphy, painting and playing the musical instrument guqin, and examinations of skill in those arts was used to qualify candidates for service in the bureaucracy. Go was brought to Korea in the second century BC when the Han Dynasty expanded into the Korean peninsula and it arrived in Japan in the 5th or 6th century AD and it quickly became a favorite aristocratic pastime.\n\ndoc2546834: Go-go dancing. Many gay clubs had male go-go dancers, often called go-go boys, from 1965 to 1968, after which few gay clubs had go-go dancers until 1988, when go-go dancing again became fashionable at gay clubs (and has remained so ever since). Nowadays, gay male go-go dancers are a lot more popular and common in American culture, especially in bigger cities such as Los Angeles and New York. In fact, there are more gay go-go dancers than female go-go dancers in today's club scene, a big turnaround from the 60's. [7][8]\n\ndoc2472272: Whisky a Go Go. The Whisky a Go Go was one of the places that popularized go-go dancing. Elmer Valentine, in a 2006 Vanity Fair article, recalled arranging to have a female DJ play records between Rivers' sets so patrons could continue dancing. But because there was not enough room on the floor for a DJ booth, he had a glass-walled booth mounted high above the floor.[8][10] A contest was held for the female DJ job but when the young winner called Valentine on the night of the opening and tearfully said her mother forbade her from doing it, Valentine recruited the club's cigarette girl, Patty Brockhurst. Valentine quickly hired two more female dancers, one of whom, Joanna Labean, designed the official go-go-girl costume of fringed dress and white boots.[10]\n\ndoc1751688: Miniskirt. The very short skirt is an element of Japanese school uniform, which since the 1990s has been exploited by young women who are part of the kogal (or gyaru) subculture as part of their look.[54] Gyaru deliberately wear their skirts short enough to reveal panties (actually a second pair worn over actual knickers) as a form of exhibitionism known as panchira.[55]\n\ndoc826515: Kum & Go. The Kum & Go name was adopted in 1975[5] to unify the company's array of stores under a single brand. It was a play on the phrase \"come and go\" using the initials of founders Krause and Gentle. Sales of Kum & Go-branded merchandise increased after Johnny Knoxville was seen wearing a Kum & Go T-shirt during a scene in the 2006 movie Jackass Number Two.[6]\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc753095: Order of the Garter. Various legends account for the origin of the Order. The most popular involves the \"Countess of Salisbury\", whose garter is said to have slipped from her leg while she was dancing at a court ball at Calais. When the surrounding courtiers sniggered, the king picked it up and returned it to her, exclaiming, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense!\" (\"Shame on him who thinks ill of it!\"), the phrase that has become the motto of the Order.[1]\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc145348: Roaring Twenties. The 1920s was a period of social revolution, coming out of World War I, society changed as inhibitions faded and youth demanded new experiences and more freedom from old controls. Chaperones faded in importance as \"anything goes\" became a slogan for youth taking control of their subculture.[68] A new woman was born\u00e2\u20ac\u201da \"flapper\" who danced, drank, smoked and voted. This new woman cut her hair, wore make-up, and partied. She was known for being giddy and taking risks; she was known as a flapper.[69] Women gained the right to vote in most countries. New careers opened for single women in offices and schools, with salaries that helped them to be more independent.[70] With their desire for freedom and independence came change in fashion.[71] One of the most dramatic post-war changes in fashion was the woman's silhouette; the dress length went from floor length to ankle and knee length, becoming more bold and seductive. The new dress code emphasized youth: corsets were left behind and clothing was looser, with more natural lines. The hourglass figure was not popular anymore, whereas a slimmer, boyish body type was considered appealing. The flappers were known for this and for their high spirits, flirtatiousness, and stereotypical recklessness when it came to their search for fun and thrills.[72]\n\ndoc696946: Green beret. No. 2 Commando and No. 9 Commando faced with the same problem had adopted the Tam o' Shanter, but, as a traditional Scottish headdress, this was not considered suitable for what was a British unit. After some discussion it was agreed that if No. 1 Commando was to adopt a uniformed headdress then the beret, which had been worn by the Tank Regiment since the First World War (and had recently been adopted by the Parachute Regiment), would meet the requirements: it had no British regional affinity, it was difficult to wear improperly, and it could be easily stowed away without damage (when for example tin hats were in use).[2]\n\ndoc1730418: 1980s in Western fashion. Parachute pants are a style of trousers characterized by the use of ripstop nylon or extremely baggy cuts. In the original tight-fitting, extraneously zippered style of the late 1970s and early 1980s, \"parachute\" referred to the pants' synthetic nylon material. In the later 1980s, \"parachute\" may have referred to the extreme bagginess of the pant. These are also referred to as \"Hammer\" pants, due to rapper MC Hammer's signature style. Hammer pants differ from the parachute pants of the 1970s and early 1980s. They are typically worn as menswear and are often brightly colored. Parachute pants became a fad in US culture in the 1980s as part of an increased cultural appropriation of breakdancing.[51]\n\ndoc2362370: Sanitary napkin. Later an adhesive strip was placed on the bottom of the pad for attachment to the crotch of the panties, and this became a favoured method with women. The belted sanitary napkin quickly disappeared during the early 1980s.\n\ndoc676772: Victoria's Secret. The company drew criticism for a newly released lingerie collection titled \"Go East\" whose tagline pledged to women the capacity to \"indulge in touches of eastern delight with lingerie inspired by the exquisite beauty of secret Japanese gardens.\"[83][211] The collection included a mesh teddy \"Sexy Little Geisha\" featuring \"flirty cutouts and Eastern-inspired florals\".\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc2446360: Goggles. Goggles are often worn as a fashion statement in certain subcultures, most often as part of the cybergoth subculture. They are usually worn over the eyes or up on the forehead to secure 'falls': a type of long, often brightly coloured, synthetic hairpiece. Fans of the steampunk genre or subculture also frequently wear steampunk-styled goggles, particularly when performing in a live action role-playing game.\n\ndoc220823: 442nd Infantry Regiment (United States). In post-war American popular slang, the phrase \"going for broke\" was adopted from the 442nd's unit motto \"Go for Broke\", which was derived from the Hawaiian pidgin phrase used by craps shooters risking all their money on one roll of the dice.[4]:69\n\ndoc54244: Jeep. (Jeepster) Commando\n\ndoc2546833: Go-go dancing. The tradition of go-go dancers on TV music shows continues around the world, such as the Viva Hotbabes and SexBomb Girls in the Philippines. However, while American shows of the 1960s featured dancers highly trained in the various choreography used in each show, many modern dancers are not so closely choreographed.\n\ndoc473901: Jeep Wrangler. The Commando Jeep is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tactical vehicle based on the Jeep Wrangler with a factory installed turbodiesel engine operating on JP-8 and global diesel fuels.[43] It is a vehicle modified for use by airborne forces, special operations forces, and combat engineers.\n\ndoc2546836: Go-go dancing. Not very many nightclubs had go-go dancers in the 1970s. However, in the late 1970s, there was a nightclub at 128 West 45th Street (the same location where the Peppermint Lounge had been) in Manhattan, New York City, called G.\u00a0G.\u00a0Barnum's Room, patronized mostly by transsexuals, that had male go-go dancers who danced on trapezes above a net over the dance floor.[9][10] In 1978, the Xenon night club in Manhattan became the first night club to provide go-go boxes for amateur go-go dancers to dance on.[11]\n\ndoc2050177: Long underwear. In 2004, Michael Quinion, a British etymologist and writer, postulated that the \"john\" in the item of apparel may be a reference to Sullivan, who wore a similar-looking garment in the ring. This explanation, however, is uncertain and the term's origin is ultimately unknown.[2] So it is also very probable that it's simply a deformation of \"longues jambes\" meaning \"long leg\" in French.\n\ndoc2050172: Long underwear. Long underwear, also called long johns or thermal underwear, is a style of two-piece underwear with long legs and long sleeves that is normally worn during cold weather. It is commonly worn by people under their clothes in cold countries.\n\ndoc435360: Break a leg. There are several theories behind the origin of the phrase. Few are supported by contemporary writings. The theories listed below are some of the more popular explanations.\n\ndoc1118409: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Chuck (\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af, Chakku)\n\ndoc1079523: Funk. Go-go originated in the Washington, D.C. area with which it remains associated, along with other spots in the Mid-Atlantic. Inspired by singers such as Chuck Brown, the \"Godfather of Go-go\", it is a blend of funk, rhythm and blues, and early hip hop, with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and in-person jamming in place of dance tracks.  As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience call and response.  Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion.\n\ndoc1118413: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Fastener (\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30ca\u30fc, Fasun\u0101)\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc2542970: Tightrope walking. Tightrope walking, also called funambulism, is the skill of walking along a thin wire or rope. It has a long tradition in various countries and is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include slack rope walking and slacklining.\n\ndoc2654995: Bikini. By the 1960s, the bikini swimsuit influenced panty styles and coincided with the cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants.[224] In the seventies, with the emergence of skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline and the rise of the leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear[225]). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure.[224] From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts.[226] Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness.[226] Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.[227]\n\ndoc692753: Let's Go All the Way (song). A music video received heavy airplay on MTV and is credited with greatly adding to the \"infectious\" song's success.[1] The video juxtaposes three distinct modes. First straightforward and color negative studio performance of the duo dancing, emoting, and performing along with the song in a bright pop-art style. This is interspersed with shots of an interracial pair of young boys engaged in various activities, predominantly picking toy weapons of war out of a shopping cart and smashing them with hammers on an anvil, as news footage is projected on a white backdrop. In other shots they march and stagger about dressed in combat fatigues and cavorting in sunglasses and surfer jams. The third thread consists of depression-era black & white clips from slapstick comedies and footage of factory workers. An atomic bomb blast is seen in reverse. The video ends with the two children in normal garb walking up to a large globe, picking the world up and carrying it.[2]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc34871: Basketball moves. \"Give and Go\" is an offensive play that involves passing the ball (give) and then running (go) to an open spot to receive the ball back, usually near the basket, for an easy score. This play can be effective when the defender pays too much attention to the ball instead of the player who moves after passing the ball. This is also known as a \"One-Two\" in street ball.\n\ndoc1564132: British slang. knees-up\u00c2\n\ndoc2266477: Flapper. The use of the term coincided with a fashion among teenage girls in the United States in the early 1920s for wearing unbuckled galoshes,[22] and a widespread false etymology held that they were called \"flappers\" because they flapped when they walked, as they wore their overshoes or galoshes unfastened, showing that they defied convention in a manner similar to the 21st century fad for untied shoelaces.[23][24] Another suggestion to the origin of the term, in relation to fashion, comes from a 1920s fashion trend in which young women left their overcoat unbuttoned to allow it to flap back and forth as they walked, appearing more independent and freed from the tight, Victorian Era style clothing.[25]\n\ndoc995323: Going Dutch. The Oxford English Dictionary connects \"go Dutch\" and \"Dutch treat\" to other phrases which have \"an opprobrious or derisive application, largely due to the rivalry and enmity between the English and Dutch in the 17th century\", the period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Another example is \"Dutch courage\".[1]\n\ndoc2619602: Go/no go gauge. A go-no gauge (or go/no-go) refers to an inspection tool used to check a workpiece against its allowed tolerances.  Its name is derived from two tests: the check involves the workpiece having to pass one test (go) and fail the other (no-go).\n\ndoc2363616: The Go-Go's (British band). The song was originally released as one of the many products fueling Dalekmania but as the craze fizzled out the song was largely forgotten, with snippets occasionally appearing in Doctor Who anthological products. It resurfaced in its entirety on the October 2000 album, Who Is Dr Who.[3]\n\ndoc696943: Green beret. The green beret was the official headdress of the British Commandos of the Second World War. It is still worn by members of the Royal Marines after passing the Commando Course and personnel from other units of the Royal Navy, Army and RAF who serve within 3 Commando Brigade and who have passed the All Arms Commando Course.\n\ndoc512471: Anything Goes (Cole Porter song). \"Anything Goes\" is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical Anything Goes (1934). Many of the lyrics feature humorous references[1] to various figures of scandal and gossip in Depression-era high society. For example, one couplet refers to Sam Goldwyn's notorious box-office failure Nana, which featured a star, Anna Sten, whose English was said to be incomprehensible to all except Goldwyn, who came from Eastern Europe (Goldwyn was from Poland and Sten Ukraine).[2] Other 1930s society references include film producer Max Gordon, socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean and her highly promoted trip to the Russian SFSR, interior design pioneer Lady Mendl's scandalous predilection for performing hand stands and cartwheels in public at the age of 70, and the financial woes common to \"old money\" families during the Depression, such as the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and Whitneys.\n\ndoc1118405: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Panty (\u30d1\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3, Panti)\n\ndoc891390: OK. Numerous explanations for the origin of the expression have been suggested, but few have been discussed seriously by linguists. The following proposals have found mainstream recognition.\n\ndoc741193: Ninja. Clothing used was similar to that of the samurai, but loose garments (such as leggings) were tucked into trousers or secured with belts. The tenugui, a piece of cloth also used in martial arts, had many functions. It could be used to cover the face, form a belt, or assist in climbing.\n\ndoc2332785: Royal Marines. Each Commando Unit will rotate through one of three roles every six months.\n\ndoc1704953: Lambeau Field. The \"Go Pack Go\" jingle is usually played when the team is on defense or during the start of a drive on offense. A song built around this jingle is \"Go Pack Go!\" by The 6 Packers.\n\ndoc1296244: Piss Up a Rope. When asked about the lyrics \"You can wash my balls with a warm wet rag\" and \"On your knees, you big bootied bitch,\" Dean Ween stated that he wrote the song for his wife. The inspiration for the title came from his father: \"[It is] a funny expression that I copped from my dad. When I was a kid, he used to say, 'Aw, go piss up a rope.' It was just nonsense. It was like, 'Aw, go shit in your hat' or whatever.\"[1]\n\ndoc1990418: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. In a press release, April reads a note from Perry, thanking the turtles for saving him, and when they return home, they deny being seen by the humans, but Splinter holds up the evening's newspaper on which they are plastered across the cover. He then orders the four of them to do flips as punishment, chanting the theme song they were dancing to at the club \"Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go!\" exclaiming he \"made another funny\" as the scene freezes.\n\ndoc2546830: Go-go dancing. Go-go dancers began to be hired on a regular basis at the Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood in the Los Angeles area in July 1965. The Whisky a Go Go was also the first go-go club to have go-go cages suspended from the ceiling (they were there from the very beginning in 1965), and thus the profession of cage dancer was born.\n\ndoc2542974: Tightrope walking. The word funambulism or the phrase \"walking a tightrope\" is also used in a metaphorical setting not referring to any actual acrobatic acts. For instance, politicians are said to \"walk a tightrope\" when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The term can also be used in satirical or acidic contexts. Nicholas Taleb uses the phrase in his book The Black Swan. \"You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports\". Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.[14]\n\ndoc1118412: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Corset (\u30b3\u30eb\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8, Korusetto)\n\ndoc2110663: Go go bar. In Southeast Asia, and particularly in Thailand and parts of the Philippines, Go Go bars can include a wide variety of indoor bars with dancers and/or hostesses; these typically do not offer striptease. These are most often venues for prostitution, and the dancers are usually available to be bar fined by customers. These are often, but not exclusively, found in red light districts catering to foreigners.\n\ndoc1085603: T-shirt. The T-shirt evolved from undergarments used in the 19th century. First, the one-piece union suit underwear was cut into separate top and bottom garments, with the top long enough to tuck under the waistband of the bottoms. With and without buttons, they were adopted by miners and stevedores during the late 19th century as a convenient covering for hot environments.\n\ndoc2546840: Go-go dancing. Go-go dancers that are hired to dance at night clubs, special parties, festivals, circuit parties or rave dances in bright, colorful costumes are called performance art dancers.[13] Their costumes often include accessories such as glow sticks, light chasers, toy ray guns that light up, go-go shorts embedded with battery-operated fiber optic tubes in various colors, strings of battery-operated colored lights in plastic tubes, fire sticks, a musical instrument, or an animal (usually a snake). In the early to mid\u00e2\u20ac\u20181980s, the performance art dancer John Sex, who performed with a python, played a role in making go-go dancing popular once again at gay and bisexual night clubs along with his life partner Sebastian Kwok.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2079875: 1920s in Western fashion. Undergarments began to transform after World War I to conform to the ideals of a flatter chest and more boyish figure.The female figure was liberated from the restrictive corset, and newly popular the boyish look was achieved through the use of bust bodices. Some of the new pieces included chemises, thin camisoles, and cami-knickers, later shortened to panties or knickers. These were primarily made from rayon and came in soft, light colors in order to be worn under semi-transparent fabrics.[12] Young flappers took to these styles of underwear due to the ability to move more freely and the increased comfort when dancing to the high tempo jazz music. During the mid-1920s, all-in-one lingerie became popular.\n\ndoc406101: Brand New Key. Many listeners[citation needed] detect sexual innuendo in the lyrics, with the key in its lock thought to symbolize sexual intercourse, or in phrases such as \"I go pretty far\" and \"I've been all around the world\". Another common viewpoint on the song, is that the song is clearly an innocent reflection upon the typical workings of a child's mind regarding their possessions (In this case, quad skates and the associated key essential for tightening/loosening a locking clamp on the skates).\n\ndoc1925969: Swim briefs. A swim brief or racing brief is any briefs-style male swimsuit such as those worn in competitive swimming and diving. The popularity of the Australian Speedo brand racing brief has led to the use of its name in many countries around the world (e.g. the United States, New Zealand, UK and Europe) to refer to any racing brief, regardless of the maker. Occasionally, the Speedo genericized trademark also applies to square cut swimsuit, but in general the generic term is used in reference to swim briefs. Swim briefs are also referred to as competition briefs, swimming trunks, bathers, racer bathers, posing briefs, racing briefs, and colloquially in Australia as \"budgie smugglers\".[1]\n\ndoc182137: Shorts. Short trousers, terminating three to four inches above the knee, commonly worn by men in Bermuda (with knee-socks and a blazer and tie) for business attire and even at cocktail parties.[13][14] They are available in a wide range of colors, ranging from conservative grey and navy, to brighter hues such as orange, green and pink.[14] Despite their name, they are not of Bermudian origin, but were originally designed around 1900 for military wear by the British armed forces in tropical climates.[14] From the 1920s onwards these military uniform shorts began to be copied by Bermudian tailors and civilians, and were subsequently taken up by tourists who spread the style around the world.[14] The tourists who appropriated the style wore Bermuda shorts almost exclusively as casual wear.[14]\n\ndoc2355569: Jeep Wrangler (JK). The Commando Jeep is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tactical vehicle based on the Jeep Wrangler with a factory installed turbodiesel engine operating on JP-8 and global diesel fuels.[24]  It is a vehicle modified for use by airborne forces, special operations forces, and combat engineers.\n\ndoc1632017: Go Where You Wanna Go. The British group The Bees recorded \"Go Where You Wanna Go\" for a digital-only release in February 2011. Their version was used in the UK 'Travelodge' TV advert.\n\ndoc537830: Days Go By (Dirty Vegas song). The music video for the song is unusual in that it largely consists of two dancers representing one character performing a routine of popping, locking, the robot and breakdancing. The performance occurs in front of Chroni's Famous Sandwich Shop in East Los Angeles, California, and tells the story of a dancer who shows up once a year and dances all day from sunrise to sunset. He dances in hopes of bringing back a lost love, who left him because he couldn't stop dancing. (The video even halts abruptly while some of the bystanders interject what they think happened to the aforementioned love.) The young dancer in the video is Garland Spencer. The older dancer is Byron McIntyre. The clue that both men represent the same character at different ages is provided by the dancer's shoes. The older dancer wears high-top Converse sneakers (\"Chuck Taylor All-Stars\" or \"Chucks\") that are faded, scuffed, and one shoe is actually taped to hold it together; whereas the young dancer wears a clean, bright-orange version of the same sneakers. According to the video's story, the man's lost love purchased the original sneakers for him as a gift, and now he wears them as part of his annual dance ritual. The sneakers match the style and attire of the young dancer in his sweatsuit (presumably in the 1980s), but pose a striking contrast for the older dancer who is otherwised attired in a suit, tie, and suspenders.\n\ndoc516028: Go West, young man. Some sources[who?] have claimed the phrase is derived from Greeley's July 13, 1865 editorial in the New York Tribune, but this text does not appear in that issue of the newspaper.[citation needed] The actual editorial instead encourages American Civil War veterans to take advantage of the Homestead Act and colonize the public lands:\n\ndoc1564099: British slang. Some slang was developed because of a need for secrecy, such as prison slang, believed to be derived from thieves cant,[11] and Polari, a variety used by homosexuals in Britain and the United Kingdom. Homosexuality was a crime until 1967 and Polari has a history going back at least a hundred years.[12] Sometimes the purpose of slang is to cause offence, insults such as wanker or gobshite for example; and sometimes the purpose is to prevent it by substituting a slang word for the offensive one, berk (rhyming slang for cunt) for example.[13] Sometimes a Spoonerism, is employed to make taboo speech more acceptable. For example: Cupid stunt and Betty Swallocks.[14]\n\ndoc1604526: Tony Gordon. In the media, specifically in the UK, he was given the humorous nickname of 'Toe Knee Gore-Don', a name which has since become synonymous with the character.\n\ndoc1921370: Going to a Go-Go. Going to a Go-Go was reissued on CD in 2002, coupled with the Miracles' Away We a Go-Go.\n\ndoc1921374: Going to a Go-Go. Going to a Go-Go was reissued on CD in 2002, coupled with the Miracles' Away We a Go-Go.\n\ndoc2546841: Go-go dancing. In Russia, in the 2013 elections the Civilian Power party put forward four female go-go dancers as candidates for deputies.[14][15]\n\ndoc543916: Trousers. The Korean word for trousers, baji (originally pajibaji) first appears in recorded history around the turn of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at least this time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined gouei to the padded sombaji.[38]\n\n"

The origins of the phrase \"go commando\" are uncertain, with some speculating that it may refer to being \"out in the open\" or \"ready for action\".[5]\n\ndoc11256: Going commando. The term appeared in the 1982 novel Groundrush by Greg Barron, in the sentence, \"Bigfoot's jock snapped underneath, leaving him to 'go commando'.\"[9] In the Chicago Tribune of January 22, 1985, Jim Spencer wrote, \"Furthermore, coloured briefs are 'sleazy' and going without underwear ('going commando', as they say on campus) is simply gross.\" The term gained currency in the popular vernacular after appearing in a 1996 episode of Friends.[10][11]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc2546828: Go-go dancing. The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops. A synonym used in Vietnam for go-go dancers is \"table dancer\".\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\ndoc194221: Ratchet & Clank. Going Commando (also known as Locked and Loaded in Europe and Ratchet & Clank 2 in Japan) was released on November 11, 2003 in North America for the PlayStation 2.\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\ndoc2551122: Gout. The term  \"gout\" was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 AD. It is derived from the Latin word gutta, meaning \"a drop\" (of liquid).[82] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is derived from humorism and \"the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints\".[83]\n\ndoc2546827: Go-go dancing. Go-go dancers are dancers who are employed to entertain crowds at nightclubs[1] or other venues where music is played. Go-go dancing originated in the early 1960s, by some accounts when women at the Peppermint Lounge in New York City began to get up on tables and dance the twist.[2] Some claim that go-go dancing originated at, and was named after, the very popular Los Angeles rock club Whisky a Go Go which opened in January 1964, but the opposite may be true \u2013 the club chose the name to reflect the already popular craze of go-go dancing.[3] Many 1960s-era clubgoers wore miniskirts and knee-high, high-heeled boots, which eventually came to be called go-go boots. Night club promoters in the mid\u20111960s then conceived the idea of hiring women dressed in these outfits to entertain patrons.\n\ndoc2110662: Go go bar. The term go-go bar is often used for certain sorts of strip clubs. In regions where the term is used, go-go bars are considered lower in class when compared to gentlemen's clubs, which offer a more coordinated and show-centric experience. In these bars:\n\ndoc2110661: Go go bar. The term go-go bar originally referred to a nightclub, bar, or similar establishment that featured Go-Go dancers; while some Go-go bars in that original sense still exist, the link between its present uses and that original meaning is often more tenuous and regional. Speaking broadly, the term has been used by venues that cover a wide range of businesses, from nightclubs or discotheques, where dancers are essentially there to set the mood, to what are in essence burlesque theaters or strip clubs, where dancers are part of a show and the primary focus.\n\ndoc2110664: Go go bar. The origin of the term go-go dancing goes back to a British film of the 1950s \u201cWhiskey Galore\u201d. This film tells the story of the sinking of a ship loaded with whiskey. The French title of this film was \"Whiskey \u00e0 Go-Go\u201d; go-go being the French expression for \"galore\". During the period that this film was showing in France, discotheques were just introduced as a new form of entertainment. Due to the success of the film and the snob appeal of drinking whiskey in France, a number of discotheques were given the name \u201cWhiskey \u00e0 Go-Go\u201d. It was also the time when dances became popular, where partners were dancing apart from each other. Not long after the success of the discotheques in France, they were opened in French style in New York City, with the same name as their French example: \u201cWhiskey A Go-Go\u201d. American discos introduced soon a form of entertainment of young girls dancing in the new, loose style, without a partner. The go-go dancer was born.[1]\n\ndoc169372: Glossary of French expressions in English. chacun \u00e0 son go\u00fbt\n\ndoc2206833: Breeching (boys). Goya, 1784. A skeleton suit or similar outfit.\n\ndoc1426156: Garter (stockings). Since the early 1960s, many men's  magazines featured images of women in underwear, with models in suspenders and stocking, often with slips, petticoats, corsets or a bra and knickers or panties in erotic pose.\nThese images may have an erotic element and are sometimes presented as fetish fashion and also in pornography.\n\ndoc607482: The Go-Go's. They were formed as a punk band and had roots in the L.A. punk community.[7] They shared a rehearsal space with the Motels and Carlisle, under the name \"Dottie Danger\", had briefly been a member of punk rock band the Germs. Due to a bout of mononucleosis, she left the Germs before playing a gig.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts. Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc1047884: 1990s in fashion. Go-go boots became fashionable again in 1995. They were worn by women of the hip-hop and preppy subcultures.\n\ndoc361901: The show must go on. There is no evidence to suggest that it is the abbreviation of a longer phrase. The saying and principle are traditional in the theater, but they both originated in the 19th century with circuses. If an animal got loose or a performer was injured, the ringmaster and the band tried to keep things going so that the crowd would not panic[1] because \"it is a point of honour not to let the other players down by deserting them when no understudy is available.\"[2]\n\ndoc484960: Pantsula. It developed from the Sotho dances of mqaquanga and marabi, with influence from 1930s American jazz.[3] Later evolutions of pantsula dancing in the 1980s were influenced by American hip hop and breakdance.[2] Quick, darting steps in geometric lines with an uneven rhythmic quality characterize this form of movement. The Charleston, a knock-kneed manoeuvre from American jazz, as well as the popping and locking found in US hip hop, are also found in this form of dance. The word pantsula is Zulu, and refers to \"waddling like a duck.\" This flat-footed move with the buttocks sticking out is commonplace in the dance form.[4]\n\ndoc710215: Wu-Tang Clan. \"I'm going to bring out Dirty Wear,\" declared ODB. \"A set of ready-worn clothes: 'Dirty Wear, for the girl who likes to wear her panties three days in a row.'\"[99]\n\ndoc543913: Trousers. During the French Revolution, male citizens of France adopted a working-class costume including ankle-length trousers, or pantaloons (from a Commedia dell'Arte character named Pantalone)[33] in place of the aristocratic knee-breeches. The new garment of the revolutionaries differed from that of the ancien regime upper classes in three ways: it was loose where the style for breeches had most recently been form-fitting, it was ankle length where breeches had generally been knee-length for more than two centuries, and they were open at the bottom while breeches were fastened. Pantaloons became fashionable in early 19th-century England and the Regency era. The style was introduced by Beau Brummell[34][35][36] and by mid-century had supplanted breeches as fashionable street wear.[37] At this point, even knee-length pants adopted the open bottoms of trousers (see shorts) and were worn by young boys, for sports, and in tropical climates. Breeches proper survived into the 20th century as court dress, and also in baggy mid-calf (or three-quarter length) versions known as plus-fours or knickers worn for active sports and by young schoolboys. Types of breeches are still worn today by baseball and American football players.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc1118414: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Ghosts (\u30b4\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8, G\u014dsuto)\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc2363615: The Go-Go's (British band). The single tried to turn the sinister Daleks into another version of the Chipmunks, with singer Sue Smith putting on a lisping childlike voice. Songwriter and record producer Les Vandyke (working under the pseudonym of Johnny Worth) was largely responsible for the track. Other musicians were Mike Johnson, Alan Cairns, Abe Harris, Bill Davison and Les McLeian.[2]\n\ndoc879219: Geordie. Howay is broadly comparable to the invocation \"Come on!\" or the French \"Allez-y!\" (\"Go on!\"). Examples of common use include Howay man!, meaning \"come on\" or \"hurry up\", Howay the lads! as a term of encouragement for a sports team for example (the players' tunnel at St James' Park has this phrase just above the entrance to the pitch), or Ho'way!? (with stress on the second syllable) expressing incredulity or disbelief.[47] The literal opposite of this phrase is haddaway (\"go away\"); although not as common as howay, it is perhaps most commonly used in the phrase \"Haddaway an' shite\" (Tom Hadaway, Figure 5.2 Haddaway an' shite; 'Cursing like sleet blackening the buds, raging at the monk of Jarrow scribbling his morality and judgement into a book.'[48]).\n\ndoc2206819: Breeching (boys). The skeleton suit consisted of trousers and tight-fitting jacket, buttoned together at the waist or higher up; they were not unlike the romper suit introduced in the early 20th century.[13] But dresses for boys did not disappear, and again became common from the 1820s, when they were worn at about knee-length, sometimes with visible pantaloons called pantalettes as underwear, a style also worn by little girls.\n\ndoc1118411: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Kneesocks (\u30cb\u30fc\u30bd\u30c3\u30af\u30b9, N\u012bsokkusu)\n\ndoc2117300: History of games. Go, also known as Weiqi, Igo, or Baduk (in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, respectively), is first mentioned in the historical annal Zuo Zhuan[27] (c. 4th century BC[28]). It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the Analects of Confucius[28] and in two of the books of Mencius[29] (c. 3rd century BC[28]). In ancient China, Go was one of the four cultivated arts of the Chinese scholar gentleman, along with calligraphy, painting and playing the musical instrument guqin, and examinations of skill in those arts was used to qualify candidates for service in the bureaucracy. Go was brought to Korea in the second century BC when the Han Dynasty expanded into the Korean peninsula and it arrived in Japan in the 5th or 6th century AD and it quickly became a favorite aristocratic pastime.\n\ndoc2546834: Go-go dancing. Many gay clubs had male go-go dancers, often called go-go boys, from 1965 to 1968, after which few gay clubs had go-go dancers until 1988, when go-go dancing again became fashionable at gay clubs (and has remained so ever since). Nowadays, gay male go-go dancers are a lot more popular and common in American culture, especially in bigger cities such as Los Angeles and New York. In fact, there are more gay go-go dancers than female go-go dancers in today's club scene, a big turnaround from the 60's. [7][8]\n\ndoc2472272: Whisky a Go Go. The Whisky a Go Go was one of the places that popularized go-go dancing. Elmer Valentine, in a 2006 Vanity Fair article, recalled arranging to have a female DJ play records between Rivers' sets so patrons could continue dancing. But because there was not enough room on the floor for a DJ booth, he had a glass-walled booth mounted high above the floor.[8][10] A contest was held for the female DJ job but when the young winner called Valentine on the night of the opening and tearfully said her mother forbade her from doing it, Valentine recruited the club's cigarette girl, Patty Brockhurst. Valentine quickly hired two more female dancers, one of whom, Joanna Labean, designed the official go-go-girl costume of fringed dress and white boots.[10]\n\ndoc1751688: Miniskirt. The very short skirt is an element of Japanese school uniform, which since the 1990s has been exploited by young women who are part of the kogal (or gyaru) subculture as part of their look.[54] Gyaru deliberately wear their skirts short enough to reveal panties (actually a second pair worn over actual knickers) as a form of exhibitionism known as panchira.[55]\n\ndoc826515: Kum & Go. The Kum & Go name was adopted in 1975[5] to unify the company's array of stores under a single brand. It was a play on the phrase \"come and go\" using the initials of founders Krause and Gentle. Sales of Kum & Go-branded merchandise increased after Johnny Knoxville was seen wearing a Kum & Go T-shirt during a scene in the 2006 movie Jackass Number Two.[6]\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc753095: Order of the Garter. Various legends account for the origin of the Order. The most popular involves the \"Countess of Salisbury\", whose garter is said to have slipped from her leg while she was dancing at a court ball at Calais. When the surrounding courtiers sniggered, the king picked it up and returned it to her, exclaiming, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense!\" (\"Shame on him who thinks ill of it!\"), the phrase that has become the motto of the Order.[1]\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc145348: Roaring Twenties. The 1920s was a period of social revolution, coming out of World War I, society changed as inhibitions faded and youth demanded new experiences and more freedom from old controls. Chaperones faded in importance as \"anything goes\" became a slogan for youth taking control of their subculture.[68] A new woman was born\u00e2\u20ac\u201da \"flapper\" who danced, drank, smoked and voted. This new woman cut her hair, wore make-up, and partied. She was known for being giddy and taking risks; she was known as a flapper.[69] Women gained the right to vote in most countries. New careers opened for single women in offices and schools, with salaries that helped them to be more independent.[70] With their desire for freedom and independence came change in fashion.[71] One of the most dramatic post-war changes in fashion was the woman's silhouette; the dress length went from floor length to ankle and knee length, becoming more bold and seductive. The new dress code emphasized youth: corsets were left behind and clothing was looser, with more natural lines. The hourglass figure was not popular anymore, whereas a slimmer, boyish body type was considered appealing. The flappers were known for this and for their high spirits, flirtatiousness, and stereotypical recklessness when it came to their search for fun and thrills.[72]\n\ndoc696946: Green beret. No. 2 Commando and No. 9 Commando faced with the same problem had adopted the Tam o' Shanter, but, as a traditional Scottish headdress, this was not considered suitable for what was a British unit. After some discussion it was agreed that if No. 1 Commando was to adopt a uniformed headdress then the beret, which had been worn by the Tank Regiment since the First World War (and had recently been adopted by the Parachute Regiment), would meet the requirements: it had no British regional affinity, it was difficult to wear improperly, and it could be easily stowed away without damage (when for example tin hats were in use).[2]\n\ndoc1730418: 1980s in Western fashion. Parachute pants are a style of trousers characterized by the use of ripstop nylon or extremely baggy cuts. In the original tight-fitting, extraneously zippered style of the late 1970s and early 1980s, \"parachute\" referred to the pants' synthetic nylon material. In the later 1980s, \"parachute\" may have referred to the extreme bagginess of the pant. These are also referred to as \"Hammer\" pants, due to rapper MC Hammer's signature style. Hammer pants differ from the parachute pants of the 1970s and early 1980s. They are typically worn as menswear and are often brightly colored. Parachute pants became a fad in US culture in the 1980s as part of an increased cultural appropriation of breakdancing.[51]\n\ndoc2362370: Sanitary napkin. Later an adhesive strip was placed on the bottom of the pad for attachment to the crotch of the panties, and this became a favoured method with women. The belted sanitary napkin quickly disappeared during the early 1980s.\n\ndoc676772: Victoria's Secret. The company drew criticism for a newly released lingerie collection titled \"Go East\" whose tagline pledged to women the capacity to \"indulge in touches of eastern delight with lingerie inspired by the exquisite beauty of secret Japanese gardens.\"[83][211] The collection included a mesh teddy \"Sexy Little Geisha\" featuring \"flirty cutouts and Eastern-inspired florals\".\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc2446360: Goggles. Goggles are often worn as a fashion statement in certain subcultures, most often as part of the cybergoth subculture. They are usually worn over the eyes or up on the forehead to secure 'falls': a type of long, often brightly coloured, synthetic hairpiece. Fans of the steampunk genre or subculture also frequently wear steampunk-styled goggles, particularly when performing in a live action role-playing game.\n\ndoc220823: 442nd Infantry Regiment (United States). In post-war American popular slang, the phrase \"going for broke\" was adopted from the 442nd's unit motto \"Go for Broke\", which was derived from the Hawaiian pidgin phrase used by craps shooters risking all their money on one roll of the dice.[4]:69\n\ndoc54244: Jeep. (Jeepster) Commando\n\ndoc2546833: Go-go dancing. The tradition of go-go dancers on TV music shows continues around the world, such as the Viva Hotbabes and SexBomb Girls in the Philippines. However, while American shows of the 1960s featured dancers highly trained in the various choreography used in each show, many modern dancers are not so closely choreographed.\n\ndoc473901: Jeep Wrangler. The Commando Jeep is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tactical vehicle based on the Jeep Wrangler with a factory installed turbodiesel engine operating on JP-8 and global diesel fuels.[43] It is a vehicle modified for use by airborne forces, special operations forces, and combat engineers.\n\ndoc2546836: Go-go dancing. Not very many nightclubs had go-go dancers in the 1970s. However, in the late 1970s, there was a nightclub at 128 West 45th Street (the same location where the Peppermint Lounge had been) in Manhattan, New York City, called G.\u00a0G.\u00a0Barnum's Room, patronized mostly by transsexuals, that had male go-go dancers who danced on trapezes above a net over the dance floor.[9][10] In 1978, the Xenon night club in Manhattan became the first night club to provide go-go boxes for amateur go-go dancers to dance on.[11]\n\ndoc2050177: Long underwear. In 2004, Michael Quinion, a British etymologist and writer, postulated that the \"john\" in the item of apparel may be a reference to Sullivan, who wore a similar-looking garment in the ring. This explanation, however, is uncertain and the term's origin is ultimately unknown.[2] So it is also very probable that it's simply a deformation of \"longues jambes\" meaning \"long leg\" in French.\n\ndoc2050172: Long underwear. Long underwear, also called long johns or thermal underwear, is a style of two-piece underwear with long legs and long sleeves that is normally worn during cold weather. It is commonly worn by people under their clothes in cold countries.\n\ndoc435360: Break a leg. There are several theories behind the origin of the phrase. Few are supported by contemporary writings. The theories listed below are some of the more popular explanations.\n\ndoc1118409: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Chuck (\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af, Chakku)\n\ndoc1079523: Funk. Go-go originated in the Washington, D.C. area with which it remains associated, along with other spots in the Mid-Atlantic. Inspired by singers such as Chuck Brown, the \"Godfather of Go-go\", it is a blend of funk, rhythm and blues, and early hip hop, with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and in-person jamming in place of dance tracks.  As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience call and response.  Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion.\n\ndoc1118413: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Fastener (\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30ca\u30fc, Fasun\u0101)\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc2542970: Tightrope walking. Tightrope walking, also called funambulism, is the skill of walking along a thin wire or rope. It has a long tradition in various countries and is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include slack rope walking and slacklining.\n\ndoc2654995: Bikini. By the 1960s, the bikini swimsuit influenced panty styles and coincided with the cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants.[224] In the seventies, with the emergence of skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline and the rise of the leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear[225]). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure.[224] From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts.[226] Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness.[226] Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.[227]\n\ndoc692753: Let's Go All the Way (song). A music video received heavy airplay on MTV and is credited with greatly adding to the \"infectious\" song's success.[1] The video juxtaposes three distinct modes. First straightforward and color negative studio performance of the duo dancing, emoting, and performing along with the song in a bright pop-art style. This is interspersed with shots of an interracial pair of young boys engaged in various activities, predominantly picking toy weapons of war out of a shopping cart and smashing them with hammers on an anvil, as news footage is projected on a white backdrop. In other shots they march and stagger about dressed in combat fatigues and cavorting in sunglasses and surfer jams. The third thread consists of depression-era black & white clips from slapstick comedies and footage of factory workers. An atomic bomb blast is seen in reverse. The video ends with the two children in normal garb walking up to a large globe, picking the world up and carrying it.[2]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc34871: Basketball moves. \"Give and Go\" is an offensive play that involves passing the ball (give) and then running (go) to an open spot to receive the ball back, usually near the basket, for an easy score. This play can be effective when the defender pays too much attention to the ball instead of the player who moves after passing the ball. This is also known as a \"One-Two\" in street ball.\n\ndoc1564132: British slang. knees-up\u00c2\n\ndoc2266477: Flapper. The use of the term coincided with a fashion among teenage girls in the United States in the early 1920s for wearing unbuckled galoshes,[22] and a widespread false etymology held that they were called \"flappers\" because they flapped when they walked, as they wore their overshoes or galoshes unfastened, showing that they defied convention in a manner similar to the 21st century fad for untied shoelaces.[23][24] Another suggestion to the origin of the term, in relation to fashion, comes from a 1920s fashion trend in which young women left their overcoat unbuttoned to allow it to flap back and forth as they walked, appearing more independent and freed from the tight, Victorian Era style clothing.[25]\n\ndoc995323: Going Dutch. The Oxford English Dictionary connects \"go Dutch\" and \"Dutch treat\" to other phrases which have \"an opprobrious or derisive application, largely due to the rivalry and enmity between the English and Dutch in the 17th century\", the period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Another example is \"Dutch courage\".[1]\n\ndoc2619602: Go/no go gauge. A go-no gauge (or go/no-go) refers to an inspection tool used to check a workpiece against its allowed tolerances.  Its name is derived from two tests: the check involves the workpiece having to pass one test (go) and fail the other (no-go).\n\ndoc2363616: The Go-Go's (British band). The song was originally released as one of the many products fueling Dalekmania but as the craze fizzled out the song was largely forgotten, with snippets occasionally appearing in Doctor Who anthological products. It resurfaced in its entirety on the October 2000 album, Who Is Dr Who.[3]\n\ndoc696943: Green beret. The green beret was the official headdress of the British Commandos of the Second World War. It is still worn by members of the Royal Marines after passing the Commando Course and personnel from other units of the Royal Navy, Army and RAF who serve within 3 Commando Brigade and who have passed the All Arms Commando Course.\n\ndoc512471: Anything Goes (Cole Porter song). \"Anything Goes\" is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical Anything Goes (1934). Many of the lyrics feature humorous references[1] to various figures of scandal and gossip in Depression-era high society. For example, one couplet refers to Sam Goldwyn's notorious box-office failure Nana, which featured a star, Anna Sten, whose English was said to be incomprehensible to all except Goldwyn, who came from Eastern Europe (Goldwyn was from Poland and Sten Ukraine).[2] Other 1930s society references include film producer Max Gordon, socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean and her highly promoted trip to the Russian SFSR, interior design pioneer Lady Mendl's scandalous predilection for performing hand stands and cartwheels in public at the age of 70, and the financial woes common to \"old money\" families during the Depression, such as the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and Whitneys.\n\ndoc1118405: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Panty (\u30d1\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3, Panti)\n\ndoc891390: OK. Numerous explanations for the origin of the expression have been suggested, but few have been discussed seriously by linguists. The following proposals have found mainstream recognition.\n\ndoc741193: Ninja. Clothing used was similar to that of the samurai, but loose garments (such as leggings) were tucked into trousers or secured with belts. The tenugui, a piece of cloth also used in martial arts, had many functions. It could be used to cover the face, form a belt, or assist in climbing.\n\ndoc2332785: Royal Marines. Each Commando Unit will rotate through one of three roles every six months.\n\ndoc1704953: Lambeau Field. The \"Go Pack Go\" jingle is usually played when the team is on defense or during the start of a drive on offense. A song built around this jingle is \"Go Pack Go!\" by The 6 Packers.\n\ndoc1296244: Piss Up a Rope. When asked about the lyrics \"You can wash my balls with a warm wet rag\" and \"On your knees, you big bootied bitch,\" Dean Ween stated that he wrote the song for his wife. The inspiration for the title came from his father: \"[It is] a funny expression that I copped from my dad. When I was a kid, he used to say, 'Aw, go piss up a rope.' It was just nonsense. It was like, 'Aw, go shit in your hat' or whatever.\"[1]\n\ndoc1990418: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. In a press release, April reads a note from Perry, thanking the turtles for saving him, and when they return home, they deny being seen by the humans, but Splinter holds up the evening's newspaper on which they are plastered across the cover. He then orders the four of them to do flips as punishment, chanting the theme song they were dancing to at the club \"Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go!\" exclaiming he \"made another funny\" as the scene freezes.\n\ndoc2546830: Go-go dancing. Go-go dancers began to be hired on a regular basis at the Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood in the Los Angeles area in July 1965. The Whisky a Go Go was also the first go-go club to have go-go cages suspended from the ceiling (they were there from the very beginning in 1965), and thus the profession of cage dancer was born.\n\ndoc2542974: Tightrope walking. The word funambulism or the phrase \"walking a tightrope\" is also used in a metaphorical setting not referring to any actual acrobatic acts. For instance, politicians are said to \"walk a tightrope\" when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The term can also be used in satirical or acidic contexts. Nicholas Taleb uses the phrase in his book The Black Swan. \"You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports\". Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.[14]\n\ndoc1118412: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Corset (\u30b3\u30eb\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8, Korusetto)\n\ndoc2110663: Go go bar. In Southeast Asia, and particularly in Thailand and parts of the Philippines, Go Go bars can include a wide variety of indoor bars with dancers and/or hostesses; these typically do not offer striptease. These are most often venues for prostitution, and the dancers are usually available to be bar fined by customers. These are often, but not exclusively, found in red light districts catering to foreigners.\n\ndoc1085603: T-shirt. The T-shirt evolved from undergarments used in the 19th century. First, the one-piece union suit underwear was cut into separate top and bottom garments, with the top long enough to tuck under the waistband of the bottoms. With and without buttons, they were adopted by miners and stevedores during the late 19th century as a convenient covering for hot environments.\n\ndoc2546840: Go-go dancing. Go-go dancers that are hired to dance at night clubs, special parties, festivals, circuit parties or rave dances in bright, colorful costumes are called performance art dancers.[13] Their costumes often include accessories such as glow sticks, light chasers, toy ray guns that light up, go-go shorts embedded with battery-operated fiber optic tubes in various colors, strings of battery-operated colored lights in plastic tubes, fire sticks, a musical instrument, or an animal (usually a snake). In the early to mid\u00e2\u20ac\u20181980s, the performance art dancer John Sex, who performed with a python, played a role in making go-go dancing popular once again at gay and bisexual night clubs along with his life partner Sebastian Kwok.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2079875: 1920s in Western fashion. Undergarments began to transform after World War I to conform to the ideals of a flatter chest and more boyish figure.The female figure was liberated from the restrictive corset, and newly popular the boyish look was achieved through the use of bust bodices. Some of the new pieces included chemises, thin camisoles, and cami-knickers, later shortened to panties or knickers. These were primarily made from rayon and came in soft, light colors in order to be worn under semi-transparent fabrics.[12] Young flappers took to these styles of underwear due to the ability to move more freely and the increased comfort when dancing to the high tempo jazz music. During the mid-1920s, all-in-one lingerie became popular.\n\ndoc406101: Brand New Key. Many listeners[citation needed] detect sexual innuendo in the lyrics, with the key in its lock thought to symbolize sexual intercourse, or in phrases such as \"I go pretty far\" and \"I've been all around the world\". Another common viewpoint on the song, is that the song is clearly an innocent reflection upon the typical workings of a child's mind regarding their possessions (In this case, quad skates and the associated key essential for tightening/loosening a locking clamp on the skates).\n\ndoc1925969: Swim briefs. A swim brief or racing brief is any briefs-style male swimsuit such as those worn in competitive swimming and diving. The popularity of the Australian Speedo brand racing brief has led to the use of its name in many countries around the world (e.g. the United States, New Zealand, UK and Europe) to refer to any racing brief, regardless of the maker. Occasionally, the Speedo genericized trademark also applies to square cut swimsuit, but in general the generic term is used in reference to swim briefs. Swim briefs are also referred to as competition briefs, swimming trunks, bathers, racer bathers, posing briefs, racing briefs, and colloquially in Australia as \"budgie smugglers\".[1]\n\ndoc182137: Shorts. Short trousers, terminating three to four inches above the knee, commonly worn by men in Bermuda (with knee-socks and a blazer and tie) for business attire and even at cocktail parties.[13][14] They are available in a wide range of colors, ranging from conservative grey and navy, to brighter hues such as orange, green and pink.[14] Despite their name, they are not of Bermudian origin, but were originally designed around 1900 for military wear by the British armed forces in tropical climates.[14] From the 1920s onwards these military uniform shorts began to be copied by Bermudian tailors and civilians, and were subsequently taken up by tourists who spread the style around the world.[14] The tourists who appropriated the style wore Bermuda shorts almost exclusively as casual wear.[14]\n\ndoc2355569: Jeep Wrangler (JK). The Commando Jeep is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tactical vehicle based on the Jeep Wrangler with a factory installed turbodiesel engine operating on JP-8 and global diesel fuels.[24]  It is a vehicle modified for use by airborne forces, special operations forces, and combat engineers.\n\ndoc1632017: Go Where You Wanna Go. The British group The Bees recorded \"Go Where You Wanna Go\" for a digital-only release in February 2011. Their version was used in the UK 'Travelodge' TV advert.\n\ndoc537830: Days Go By (Dirty Vegas song). The music video for the song is unusual in that it largely consists of two dancers representing one character performing a routine of popping, locking, the robot and breakdancing. The performance occurs in front of Chroni's Famous Sandwich Shop in East Los Angeles, California, and tells the story of a dancer who shows up once a year and dances all day from sunrise to sunset. He dances in hopes of bringing back a lost love, who left him because he couldn't stop dancing. (The video even halts abruptly while some of the bystanders interject what they think happened to the aforementioned love.) The young dancer in the video is Garland Spencer. The older dancer is Byron McIntyre. The clue that both men represent the same character at different ages is provided by the dancer's shoes. The older dancer wears high-top Converse sneakers (\"Chuck Taylor All-Stars\" or \"Chucks\") that are faded, scuffed, and one shoe is actually taped to hold it together; whereas the young dancer wears a clean, bright-orange version of the same sneakers. According to the video's story, the man's lost love purchased the original sneakers for him as a gift, and now he wears them as part of his annual dance ritual. The sneakers match the style and attire of the young dancer in his sweatsuit (presumably in the 1980s), but pose a striking contrast for the older dancer who is otherwised attired in a suit, tie, and suspenders.\n\ndoc516028: Go West, young man. Some sources[who?] have claimed the phrase is derived from Greeley's July 13, 1865 editorial in the New York Tribune, but this text does not appear in that issue of the newspaper.[citation needed] The actual editorial instead encourages American Civil War veterans to take advantage of the Homestead Act and colonize the public lands:\n\ndoc1564099: British slang. Some slang was developed because of a need for secrecy, such as prison slang, believed to be derived from thieves cant,[11] and Polari, a variety used by homosexuals in Britain and the United Kingdom. Homosexuality was a crime until 1967 and Polari has a history going back at least a hundred years.[12] Sometimes the purpose of slang is to cause offence, insults such as wanker or gobshite for example; and sometimes the purpose is to prevent it by substituting a slang word for the offensive one, berk (rhyming slang for cunt) for example.[13] Sometimes a Spoonerism, is employed to make taboo speech more acceptable. For example: Cupid stunt and Betty Swallocks.[14]\n\ndoc1604526: Tony Gordon. In the media, specifically in the UK, he was given the humorous nickname of 'Toe Knee Gore-Don', a name which has since become synonymous with the character.\n\ndoc1921370: Going to a Go-Go. Going to a Go-Go was reissued on CD in 2002, coupled with the Miracles' Away We a Go-Go.\n\ndoc1921374: Going to a Go-Go. Going to a Go-Go was reissued on CD in 2002, coupled with the Miracles' Away We a Go-Go.\n\ndoc2546841: Go-go dancing. In Russia, in the 2013 elections the Civilian Power party put forward four female go-go dancers as candidates for deputies.[14][15]\n\ndoc543916: Trousers. The Korean word for trousers, baji (originally pajibaji) first appears in recorded history around the turn of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at least this time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined gouei to the padded sombaji.[38]\n\n"
