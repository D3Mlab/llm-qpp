Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out;[5] in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed;[6] and in 1982, when the USSR went through.[7] Although Scotland have played at eight finals tournaments, they have qualified on nine occasions. The Scottish Football Association declined to participate in 1950 as Scotland were not the British champions.[8]\n\ndoc8271: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Craig Brown guided Scotland to qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, finishing as the best runners-up. Scotland were drawn against holders Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup.[32] John Collins scored from the penalty spot to level the score at 1\u20131, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2\u20131 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1\u20131 with Norway in Bordeaux,[2] but the final match against Morocco ended in a 3\u20130 defeat.[33] Scotland have not appeared at the World Cup since.\n\ndoc8263: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years.[10] A \"skilful but fragile\" team lost a play-off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962.[10] A team managed by Jock Stein, but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments, lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament.[10] A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970.[10]\n\ndoc8270: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France.[30] Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1\u20130 to Costa Rica.[31] While they recovered to beat Sweden 2\u20131 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1\u20130 and were once again eliminated after the first round.[31] Goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal.[10]\n\ndoc506798: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Under the guidance of manager Andy Roxburgh, Scotland qualified for the UEFA European Championship for the first time in 1992.[1] A 1\u20130 defeat to Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1\u20131 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through as group winners.[2] Despite competing well in defeats against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the CIS, the team was knocked out at the group stage.[2]\n\ndoc1378206: List of Scotland international footballers. The Scotland national football team is the joint-oldest international football team, having played in the first official international match, a goalless draw on 30 November 1872 against England.[1]  Since then, the team has established a long-standing rivalry with England, particularly in the annual British Home Championship, which Scotland won 24 times outright and shared a further 17 times.[2] The team has enjoyed less success in continental and global competition. Even though Scotland has participated in eight FIFA World Cup and two UEFA European Championship final tournaments,[3] the team has never progressed beyond the first round of any major tournament.[3]\n\ndoc8268: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8269: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc176145: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland has competed in every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987. Their best finish was fourth in 1991.[38] In their semi-final on 26 October 1991 Scotland lost 6\u20139 to England at Murrayfield after Gavin Hastings missed a penalty almost in front of and a short distance from the posts. On 30 October Scotland lost the third-place play-off to New Zealand in Cardiff 13\u20136.[38] Since then they have qualified for the quarter-finals in all but one occasion, in 2011.[80] Their most recent world cup campaign in 2015 saw them come within 30 seconds of a famous win over Australia, however a last minute penalty sealed the win for the Wallabies.[95]\n\ndoc506797: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Scotland have participated in two UEFA European Football Championships finals, those held in 1992 and 1996. They have played six matches: winning two, drawing one and losing three. They have scored four goals and conceded five.\n\ndoc176135: Scotland national rugby union team. In the 2017 Six Nations, Scotland saw a marked improvement in performance with three home wins and two away defeats. This was Vern Cotter's last tournament as head coach of Scotland, despite their also beating Australia 24-19 on the summer tour of the Southern Hemisphere. In their first 6Ns game, Scotland went in with confidence to win their first opening match for eleven years against Ireland in a close match at Murrayfield Stadium.[101][102] This followed with a defeat in Paris to France. Scotland secured a win over Wales in their third game, Scotland's first since 2007. In the eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup tie against England at Twickenham,[103] however, Scotland were thrashed 61-21.[104] This was a record defeat against the English, and a result which ended their hopes of winning the Six Nations.[104] In the last week, Scotland defeated Italy at Murrayfield with a 29-0 victory, securing fourth place in the tournament table.[105]\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc176124: Scotland national rugby union team. In the first match of the 2006 Six Nations campaign, against France, Scotland won 20\u201316,[55] and this was the first time since 1999 that they had beaten France.[56] Scotland also beat England 18\u201312 at home at Murrayfield to reclaim the Calcutta Cup.[57] In the 2006 Autumn internationals Scotland won two of three fixtures. They convincingly beat Romania[58] and put up a solid first half performance against the Pacific Islanders.[59] In the final match against Australia, Scotland failed to impress, with Australia winning 44\u201315.[60]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc176129: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland had a poor showing in the 2011 Six Nations, winning just one match, a 21\u20138 victory over Italy.[76] In the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Scotland struggled to beat Romania 34\u201324 and Georgia 15\u20136,[77][78] before losing 13\u201312 to Argentina.[79] Needing a win going into their final match against England in Auckland, they led 12\u20133 with a quarter of the game to go, only to lose out to a Chris Ashton try, going down 16\u201312. This was the first time Scotland had been knocked out in the group stages of the Rugby World Cup.[80]\n\ndoc1616474: United Kingdom national football team. England have been the only Home Nation to have any major success internationally, winning the 1966 World Cup. Scotland have qualified for the final tournaments of eight World Cups and two European Championships, but have never progressed beyond the group stage of any international tournament.  Northern Ireland have not qualified for a World Cup finals tournament since 1986, and Wales since 1958.\n\ndoc176096: Scotland national rugby union team. The Scottish rugby team dates back to 1871, where they beat England in the first international rugby union match at Raeburn Place. Scotland competed in the Five Nations from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright\u2014including the last ever Five Nations in 1999\u2014and sharing it another 8. In 2000 the competition accepted a sixth competitor, Italy, thus forming the Six Nations. Since this change, Scotland have yet to win the competition. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all eight competitions, the most recent being in 2015 where they were knocked out by Australia at the quarter-final stage in controversial circumstances. Their best finish came in 1991, where they lost to the All Blacks in the third place play-off.\n\ndoc8262: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8267: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. After taking a single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress.[6] Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever;[19] Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net.[19][24] The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, however, as Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.[6] This performance against strong opponents only heightened the frustration at the poor results earlier in the competition.[10] MacLeod initially retained his position, but resigned later that year.[10]\n\ndoc176117: Scotland national rugby union team. The second World Cup took place in 1991 with matches shared between the Five Nations. Scotland won their pool, though the game against Ireland was close, and then beat Western Samoa in the quarter-final. They lost to England in the semi-final held at Murrayfield to a Rob Andrew drop goal. In the third place play-off they were beaten by New Zealand.[38]\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc8265: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland appointed Ally MacLeod as manager in 1977. Scotland qualified for the 1978 FIFA World Cup with victories over Czechoslovakia and Wales.[18] During the build-up to the tournament, MacLeod fuelled the hopes of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home from Argentina with a medal.[19] As the squad left for the finals, they were given an enthusiastic send off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park.[20] Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America.[19] This enthusiasm was not just generated internally, as respected coaches such as Rinus Michels and Miljan Miljani\u0107 rated Scotland amongst the favourites to win the competition.[10][21] The Royal Mail commissioned designs of commemorative stamps that would have been circulated if Scotland had won the World Cup.[22]\n\ndoc2265541: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup,[1] commonly known as the Scottish Cup,[2][3] is an annual association football knock-out cup competition for men's football clubs in Scotland.[1] The competition was first held in 1873\u201374. Entry is open to all clubs with full or associate membership of the Scottish Football Association (SFA).[4] The competition is called the William Hill Scottish Cup for sponsorship reasons.[5][6]\n\ndoc176128: Scotland national rugby union team. In the 2010 Six Nations Scotland lost against France, Wales and Italy before drawing with England. Against Ireland, in the final rugby match at Croke Park, Scotland gained their only win of the tournament 23\u201320 with a last-minute penalty by Dan Parks, denying the Irish the Triple Crown and assuring they themselves would avoid the wooden spoon.[73] That summer, Scotland toured Argentina and recorded their first ever away series victory, beating the Pumas in both tests, 24\u201316 and 13\u20139.[74] In the Autumn Internationals of 2010, Scotland lost heavily against New Zealand before recording victories against South Africa, 21\u201317, and Samoa, 19\u201316.[75]\n\ndoc2457740: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. England and Scotland have played each other more than any other nation, playing 113 official matches.[56][57] England have the better record overall in the fixture, with 48 wins to Scotland's 41.[58] There have been 24 draws, only three of them goalless, with 98 years separating the first and second of those matches.[58] England have scored 195 goals to 171 by Scotland.[58] The record margin of victory in the fixture was England's 9\u20133 win in 1961,[58] while Scotland's biggest victory was 7\u20132 in 1878.[58] The record attendance of 149,415, which is also a European record attendance, was set at Hampden Park in 1937.[19]\n\ndoc176119: Scotland national rugby union team. The third World Cup, held in South Africa, came in 1995. Pool play saw a narrow defeat by France, thanks to an injury-time try, and Scotland finished second in the pool. They were eliminated in the quarter-final against New Zealand.[41]\n\ndoc506799: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. After Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Andy Roxburgh was replaced by Craig Brown as Scotland manager.[3] Brown successfully guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament, in second place behind Russia.[3] The first game at the tournament against the Netherlands ended 0\u20130, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against rivals England at Wembley Stadium.[3] Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2\u20130 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1\u20130 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4\u20130 lead in the other match briefly put both teams in a position to qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were eliminated on goals scored.[3] The Netherlands and Scotland both had four points and a goal difference of minus one.[4]\n\ndoc176115: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland went to the first World Cup, played in New Zealand and Australia in the summer of 1987. John Rutherford, the team's general and controlling influence, had injured his knee on an unauthorised tour of Bermuda. He broke down after less than a quarter of an hour of the first World Cup match against France and never played for Scotland again. Scotland had been in the lead but the match finished level. Scotland lost to New Zealand in the quarter-final. On 27 June 1988, Ian McGeechan was appointed as head coach to succeed Derrick Grant who had retired after the end of the 1988 Five Nations series.[34]\n\ndoc2265547: Scottish Cup. Clubs that are not members of the SFA may still qualify for the tournament by winning the Highland League, Lowland League, East or South of Scotland football leagues. Clubs that are members of the Scottish Junior Football Association (SJFA) have been able to qualify since 2007 by winning one of the three regional Super League divisions or by winning the Scottish Junior Cup.[10] Three junior clubs, Banks O' Dee, Girvan and Linlithgow Rose are also SFA members and therefore qualify automatically. From 2015, the winners of the Scottish Amateur Cup are also eligible to qualify.[11]\n\ndoc176120: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland won the last-ever Five Nations Championship in 1999 with a last minute win by Wales over England.[42] However, in the 1999 World Cup they suffered a quarter-final defeat to New Zealand.[43]\n\ndoc2265551: Scottish Cup. As Scotland is a member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the winner of the Scottish Cup qualifies to compete in European-wide competitions organised by UEFA. Between 1960 and 1998, the Scottish Cup winners qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup along with winners of other domestic cup competitions across Europe before it was abolished.[17] The Scottish Cup winners now qualify to compete in the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly known as the UEFA Cup).[18] It is possible for the Scottish Cup winners to have already qualified for a UEFA competition through their league ranking in the Scottish Premiership. In this scenario the qualification spot passes to the highest ranked team in that competition not yet qualified, rather than to the Scottish Cup runners-up.[19][20] Until 2014, the Scottish Cup runners-up qualified for European competition if the cup winners had also qualified for the Champions League.[20]\n\ndoc176121: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland endured a torrid Six Nations in 2000, losing their first four straight games.[44] but won the final game against England 19\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13 under captain Andy Nicol.[45]\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc983191: List of Scottish Cup finals. The Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the Scottish Cup, is a knockout cup competition in Scottish football. Organised by the Scottish Football Association, it is the third oldest existing football competition in the world, having commenced in the 1873\u201374 season just two years after the first FA Cup. The winners are awarded the world's oldest trophy, minted in 1885.[1]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc2265552: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Football Association was founded in 1873 and the Scottish Cup was created as an annual competition for its members.[21] The first Scottish Cup match took place on 18 October 1873 when Renton defeated Kilmarnock FC 2\u20130 in the first round.[22] In its early years the competition was dominated by Queen's Park who won the final 10 times in the first twenty years.[23] Vale of Leven, Dumbarton and Renton were also successful during this period.[4] In 1885, the record margin of victory in the tournament was recorded when Arbroath defeated Bon Accord 36\u20130 in a first round match.[4][23]\n\ndoc176097: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland have a strong rivalry with the English national team. They both annually compete for the Calcutta Cup. Each year, this fixture is played out as part of the Six Nations, with Scotland having last won in 2018.\n\ndoc8266: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland's first game was against Peru in C\u00f3rdoba. Two spectacular goals by Te\u00f3filo Cubillas meant that the result was a 3\u20131 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1\u20131 draw against Iran.[19] The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.[23] MacLeod had made strange selection choices, picking inexperienced full-backs and retaining the out-of-form Bruce Rioch and Don Masson.[10]\n\ndoc312850: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won.

Scotland opened their 2008 Six Nations campaign losing 27\u20136 to France at home.[63] Pressure on Frank Hadden started to intensify after Scotland lost to Wales[64] and then to Ireland.[65] They then defeated England in the Calcutta Cup with a 15\u20139 victory[66] before succumbing to Italy, avoiding the wooden spoon only on scoring difference.[67] They then toured Argentina in the summer to play two tests against Argentina. They lost the first test 21\u201315, but won the second 26\u201314.[68]\n\ndoc983194: List of Scottish Cup finals. In 1909 the cup was withheld by the SFA after a riot broke out following a replay between Rangers and Celtic. The first match was drawn 2\u20132 and the second 1\u20131.[7]\n\ndoc176112: Scotland national rugby union team. Jim Telfer became national coach in 1980,[23] inheriting a squad of genuine potential.[22] In March 1982 Scotland won away in Wales for the first time in 20 years.[24] Scotland toured Australia in July 1982 and won the first test, Scotland's first away victory against any of the big three Southern Hemisphere sides.[25][26] After this, the 1983 season was a disappointment; losing their first three Five Nations matches.[27] However, the tournament ended on a high when Scotland recorded only their second victory over England at Twickenham since 1938.[23] Scotland then went on to draw with the All Blacks 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 in the late autumn.[27]\n\ndoc1051360: Scotland. Scotland contested the first ever international football game in 1872 against England.[348] The match took place at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow, home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club. Scottish clubs have been successful in European competitions with Celtic winning the European Cup in 1967, Rangers and Aberdeen winning the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and 1983 respectively, and Aberdeen also winning the UEFA Super Cup in 1983.\n\ndoc2431703: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup.

Scotland eventually went out of the championship on goal difference, but would have proceeded beyond the first round of a tournament for the first time in their history had England not conceded a late goal in their 4\u20131 defeat of the Netherlands in their next game.[37] The Guardian newspaper later commented that \"England fans' joy was complete when Patrick Kluivert stole a late goal for the Dutch \u2013 and thereby deprived Scotland of a place in the quarter-finals\".[38]\n\ndoc1051359: Scotland. Scotland hosts its own national sporting competitions and has independent representation at several international sporting events, including the FIFA World Cup, the Rugby Union World Cup, the Rugby League World Cup, the Cricket World Cup, the Netball World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. Scotland has its own national governing bodies, such as the Scottish Football Association (the second oldest national football association in the world)[345] and the Scottish Rugby Union. Variations of football have been played in Scotland for centuries, with the earliest reference dating back to 1424.[346] Association football is the most popular sport and the Scottish Cup is the world's oldest national trophy.[347]\n\ndoc2265556: Scottish Cup. Some clubs have become renowned for eliminating higher ranked clubs from the tournament despite being underdogs. Division Two club East Fife won the tournament in 1938 by defeating Division One club Kilmarnock, the first team from outside the top-tier of league football to win the trophy. East Fife had previously reached the final in 1927 after eliminating three higher ranked clubs in the preceding rounds.[33] Hibernian became the second second-tier side to win the cup as they defeated Rangers, another second-tier side, in the 2016 final. Only one other club from outside the top-tier of league football has won the competition; non-league Queen's Park defeated Celtic in the 1893 final.[note 2] Several other clubs have reached the final whilst competing outside the top-tier of league football, but were defeated in the final. These include Dumbarton, Kilmarnock, Airdrieonians, Falkirk (twice), Gretna, Queen of the South and Ross County.\n\ndoc2457722: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. According to The Scotsman newspaper of 2 December 1872, there were only about ten football clubs in Scotland. These early international matches helped to increase the popularity of association football in Scotland.[18] The first official match was held on 30 November 1872, on Scotland's national saint's day, St. Andrew's Day, and it took place at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club.[19][20] The Scotland team was made up entirely of players from Queen's Park,[19] the most successful Scottish club of the period.[20] The game ended a 0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 draw, watched by a crowd of 4000 who had paid a shilling each for admission.[19][20]\n\ndoc176133: Scotland national rugby union team. The 2015 Six Nations Championship ended in a whitewash for Scotland, despite optimism amongst players and supporters beforehand.[93] However, Scotland displayed improved performances in their World Cup warm-up games over the summer, with two wins over Italy and narrow defeats away in Ireland and France.[94] Scotland played well at the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England; qualifying from their group by beating Japan, USA and Samoa, although they lost to South Africa. Scotland played Australia in the quarter-finals, and with 30 seconds remaining led 34\u00e2\u20ac\u201c32. However, referee Craig Joubert then awarded the Wallabies a highly controversial penalty, later judged by the game's ruling body to be incorrect, which Bernard Foley scored to give Australia victory.[95][96]\n\ndoc2431695: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. 15 clubs were involved in the draw, of which nine received a bye to the second preliminary round, while the other six entered the first preliminary round. The teams competing in these rounds were made up of teams from the East of Scotland Football League (5), South of Scotland Football League (3), North Caledonian Football League (1), Scottish Junior Football Association (4) and the Scottish Amateur Football Association (2). Glenafton Athletic took part in the Scottish Cup for the first time after winning the 2016\u201317 West of Scotland Super League Premier Division and the 2016\u201317 Scottish Junior Cup.\n\ndoc176105: Scotland national rugby union team. Internationals resumed in the 1946\u201347 season, although these were not formally recognised and no caps were awarded to participating players.[6] In January 1946, Scotland played and defeated a strong New Zealand Armed Forces team by 11\u20136.[9][10] Scotland resumed full international matches in February 1947, losing 22\u20138 to Wales at Murrayfield.[6]\n\ndoc2230756: Aberdeen F.C.. Halliday's place in the Aberdeen Hall of Fame was secured after the war when he became the first manager to bring national trophies to Pittodrie. Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup in the 1945\u201346 season, defeating Rangers 3\u20132 at Hampden.[16] They then reached the 1947 Scottish Cup final, defeating Hibernian 2\u20131 with George Hamilton, signed from Halliday's former club Queen of the South, scoring to gain the club's first major trophy.[14][18] From this early success, Halliday's side reached two more Scottish Cup finals, in 1953 and 1954, though they lost both.[14] Halliday's team were not to be denied, however, and the following season, 1954\u201355, Aberdeen won their first Scottish League title.[14][18] Though league winners, the club did not participate in the first European Cup competition\u2014Scotland's place was awarded to Hibernian, who took part by special invitation.[19]\n\ndoc2431691: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. The 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 Scottish Cup was the 133rd season of Scotland's most prestigious football knockout competition. The tournament was sponsored by bookmaker William Hill in what is the seventh season of a nine-year partnership, after contract negotiations saw the initial five-year contract extended for an additional four years in October 2015.[2]\n\ndoc176103: Scotland national rugby union team. In 1926, Scotland became the first Home nation side to defeat England at Twickenham after England had won the Grand Slam five times in eight seasons.[5][8]\n\ndoc1692965: Rangers F.C. in European football. Rangers became the first Scottish club to qualify from both the Champions League group stage in 2005\u201306[2] and the UEFA Cup group stage in 2006\u201307.[3]\n\ndoc1616483: United Kingdom national football team. A Great British team lined up against another Rest of Europe XI in 1965 for Stanley Matthews' testimonial.

Scotland were defeated 3\u20132 at Craven Cottage on 22 March 1976.[13][14]\n\ndoc312848: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. European competition started in 1955 with the European Cup and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which was succeeded by the UEFA Cup for the 1971\u201372 season. The Cup Winners' Cup followed in 1960 but was discontinued in 1999. Three Scottish teams have lifted at least one European trophy. Celtic won the European Cup in 1967, Rangers won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and Aberdeen won the Cup Winners' Cup and Super Cup in 1983. Intercontinental competition started in 1960 with the Intercontinental Cup, which consisted of a two-legged tie between the European Cup and the South American Copa Libertadores winners from 1960 to 1979. To date, Celtic are the only Scottish club to participate in an intercontinental competition, losing the 1967 Intercontinental Cup to Racing Club.[1]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc2391832: Scottish Premier League. In 2003, Celtic became the first Scottish club since Dundee United in 1987 to reach a European final, eventually losing 3\u20132 to Porto after extra time in the UEFA Cup final.[23] In 2003\u201304, two Scottish clubs, Celtic and Rangers, qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time. In 2005\u201306, Rangers became the first Scottish club to reach the knockout stage of the Champions League,[24] a feat repeated by Celtic the following two seasons.[25][26] In the 2007\u201308 season, three Scottish clubs were competing in Europe after Christmas for the first time since 1970,[27] while in the same season, Rangers reached the 2008 UEFA Cup final, but lost 2\u20130 to Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg.[28] During the season, Scotland's European representatives collected the most coefficient points since the 1982\u201383 season.[20]\n\ndoc2431692: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup.

Scotland went through 1994 without a single win,[39] but bounced back in 1995 to win their first three Five Nations matches.[40] This run of wins included a 23\u201321 win away against France, courtesy of a last minute try and conversion by Gavin Hastings.[39] This was Scotland's first win in Paris since 1969.[39][40] The last Five Nations match was another Grand Slam decider against England, however this time the English defeated the Scots 24\u201312, largely due to the kicking prowess of Rob Andrew.[40]\n\ndoc983192: List of Scottish Cup finals. Celtic hold the record for most wins with 37, and the most final appearances with 56. Celtic are also the current holders, having beaten Aberdeen 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 in the 2017 final.\n\ndoc176144: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland competes annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: France, England, Ireland, Italy and Wales.[5] The Six Nations started out as the Home Nations Championship in 1883, with Scotland sharing the championship with England in 1886 before winning the title outright for the first time a year later.[5] Scotland have won the title outright 15 times and shared the championship a further nine times. Scotland have won three Grand Slams (including the Triple Crown) in 1925, 1984 and 1990, in addition to a further seven Triple Crowns.[5] They also contest the Calcutta Cup with England as part of the championship.[5] Scotland were the winners of the last Five Nations in 1999, before Italy joined the competition to make it the Six Nations.[5]\n\ndoc2457741: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. Scotland long held an advantage in terms of wins, as they recorded ten wins in the first 16 matches. Scotland, the smaller country in terms of population, were superior during this period because passing football developed earlier there, as shown by the Scotch Professors who moved to play in the nascent English professional league during the late 1880s.[59] Scotland were also dominant in the 1920s and 30s and prior to the Second World War had 29 wins in the series to England's 19. England reversed the dominance after the war, as Scotland have only won 12 matches since then. The Scots did win three games out of four from 1974 to 1977, but lost every other game in the 1970s, and have only won three times (compared to 13 English wins) since 1977. England pulled ahead for the first time in the history of the fixture with their win in 1983.\n\ndoc2265554: Scottish Cup. A total of 34 clubs have appeared in the final, of whom 25 have won the competition.[29] The most successful club in terms of wins and appearances in the final is Celtic, with 37 wins from 56.[30] Celtic and Rangers have finished runners-up on more occasions than any other club with 18 defeats each in the final.[30] The most recent winner is Celtic, who defeated Aberdeen 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 in the 2017 final.[30]\n\ndoc312847: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. Competitive football started in Scotland with the Scottish Cup, the second oldest football competition in the world, which was first held in the 1873\u201374 season. League football followed when the Scottish Football League was founded in 1890, with Dumbarton and Rangers sharing the first title. The Scottish Football League remained the highest division of the Scottish football league system until 1998, when the Scottish Premier League was founded. The Scottish Football League also added a second major cup competition in 1946, when it founded the League Cup, invititation to which is restricted to the 42 members of the league. Rangers have won a record number of league championships and League Cups, while Celtic have won a record number of Scottish Cups.\n\ndoc2265543: Scottish Cup. The tournament starts at the beginning of the Scottish football season in August or September.[7] The Scottish Cup Final is usually the last game of the season, taking place at the end of May.[7] Participating teams enter the tournament at different stages depending on their league ranking.[8] The lowest ranked clubs enter the tournament at the first round whilst the highest ranked, those that compete in the Scottish Premiership, enter at the fourth round stage.\n\ndoc2431702: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. East of Scotland teams\n\ndoc2431707: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. East of Scotland teams\n\ndoc2431713: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup.

Scotland were terrible during the 2012 Six Nations, picking up the wooden spoon and being whitewashed, despite promising moments,[81] and falling to 12th, Scotland's lowest ever in the IRB rankings.[82] Even after this whitewash, Scotland defeated Australia 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 in the 2012 Scotland rugby union tour of Australia, Fiji and Samoa. This was Scotland's first win in Australia since 1982 and the first time in 30 years that Scotland defeated Australia more than once in a row.[83] Scotland also recorded away wins over both Fiji and Samoa.[84] During Scotland's 2012 Autumn Tests they suffered a series of defeats, versus the All Blacks, South Africa and most notably Tonga, which caused head coach Andy Robinson to resign.[85] Scott Johnson became interim Head Coach for the team in December 2012.[86]\n\ndoc897513: 2015 Cricket World Cup. Scotland defeated the United Arab Emirates in the final of the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier and both teams qualified for the last two spots in the 2015 Cricket World Cup.[26]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\ndoc2457725: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The only exception to this pattern of annual fixtures in the spring was in 1973, when there were two games. The first game that year was a friendly match that marked the centenary of the Scottish Football Association. There were also two fixtures staged in 1902, but this was because the first game had to be abandoned due to the first Ibrox disaster. The British Home Championship also acted as qualifiers for three major tournaments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 1950 World Cup, the 1954 World Cup and the 1968 European Championship.\n\ndoc2265546: Scottish Cup. Any club that is a full or associate member of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) is entitled to compete in the tournament and qualifies automatically.[1] Every team that plays in the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is therefore eligible. Between 1895 and 2007, clubs that were SFA members but not competitors in the country's professional football leagues could only qualify for the tournament by winning the Scottish Qualifying Cup.[10]\n\ndoc312849: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. Domestic League\nLeague = Scottish league champions (since 1890)\n\ndoc176095: Scotland national rugby union team. The Scotland national rugby union team is administered by the Scottish Rugby Union. The team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and participates in the Rugby World Cup, which takes place every four years. As of 26\u00a0February\u00a02018[update], Scotland are 5th in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\ndoc176114: Scotland national rugby union team. In January 1986, a trial match between \"Blues\" (players expected to feature for Scotland) and \"Reds\" (emerging players with a possible international future) resulted in a shock 41\u201310 win for the \"Reds\".[30] The \"Reds\" team included Gavin and Scott Hastings, Finlay Calder and David Sole, all of whom who would debut for Scotland in the Five Nations that year and feature prominently for side in the years that followed.[31] Scotland went on to share the 1986 Five Nations championship with France, each side winning three out of their four games.[32] The series also saw Scotland thrash England 33\u20136 at Murrayfield; Scotland's record win over the English, at the time one point short of Scotland's best score in any rugby union international and England's heaviest defeat in over a century.[33]\n\ndoc180689: Scottish independence referendum, 2014. Former Labour first minister Henry McLeish published a report in May 2014 that found no obvious barriers to an independent Scotland competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[285] McLeish said that some athletes, particularly those in team sports, may choose to compete for the existing Great Britain team rather than Scotland, as they would be nationals of both states.[285] International Olympic Committee representative Craig Reedie pointed out that Scotland would need to obtain United Nations membership and may want to set its own Olympic qualifying standards, which would need to be done in the period between independence (March 2016) and the closing date for entries (July 2016).[285][286]\n\ndoc2431699: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. The first round took place on the weekend of 23 September 2017. Along with the six winners from the second preliminary round, there were 30 new entries at this stage, 14 from the Lowland Football League and 16 from the Highland Football League.[6]\n\ndoc983196: List of Scottish Cup finals. A draw in the final used to result in the match being replayed at a later date. Since the 1981 final, however, the result has always been decided on the day, with a penalty shootout if required after extra time.\n\ndoc2457743: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. Rangers defeated Leeds United home and away to qualify for the first Champions League group stage in 1992\u201393. Celtic lost on the away goals rule to Liverpool in the 1997\u201398 UEFA Cup, but they beat Blackburn Rovers and Liverpool on their run to the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.[65] Celtic and Manchester United were drawn together twice in the Champions League group phase in quick succession, in 2006\u201307 and 2008\u201309,[65] while Arsenal beat Celtic 5\u20131 on aggregate in the 2009\u201310 qualifiers.\n\ndoc2457724: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. From the first match in late 1872, England and Scotland played each other in the spring of every year (except during World War I and World War II) until 1989. From 1884 until 1984, the match was the highlight of the annual British Home Championship played between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[note 1] After the British Home Championship ended in 1984, the annual England v Scotland fixture continued in the form of the Rous Cup until 1989.\n\ndoc1072912: 1998 FIFA World Cup. Scotland managed only one point, coming in a 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 draw against Norway, and failed to get out of the first round for an eighth time in the FIFA World Cup, a record that stands to this date.\n\ndoc1057503: 1938 Scottish Cup Final. The 1938 Scottish Cup Final was played on 23 April 1938 at Hampden Park in Glasgow and was the final of the 60th Scottish Cup. East Fife and Kilmarnock contested the match. Following a 1\u20131 draw the match was replayed on 27 April 1938, at the end of normal time the score was 2\u20132. East Fife then went on to win the match 4\u20132 to win their only Scottish Cup, helmed by their manager David McLean.\n\ndoc1815072: 2018\u201319 Scottish League Cup. The competition began with eight groups of five teams. The four clubs competing in the UEFA Champions League (Celtic) and Europa League (Aberdeen, Hibernian and Rangers) qualifying rounds were given a bye through to the second round. The 40 teams competing in the group stage consisted of the other eight teams that competed in the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership, and all of the teams that competed in the 2017\u201318 Scottish Championship, 2017\u201318 Scottish League One and 2017\u201318 Scottish League Two, as well as the 2017\u201318 Highland Football League and the 2017\u201318 Lowland Football League champions.\n\ndoc2457723: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The first goal between the two sides was scored by England's William Kenyon-Slaney[21] in the next game at The Oval, the first official match between the two in England, which the English won 4\u20132 on 8 March 1873.[18] Following this, the game became an annual event, being held in England or Scotland in alternate years.[18] Scotland took their first win in the fixture in the 1874 game, again played at Hamilton Crescent, where they defeated England 2\u20131.[22] Later in the 1870s Scotland won the fixture three times in a row, including a 7\u20132 victory in the 1878 game.[18]\n\ndoc312846: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. This is a list of the major honours won by football clubs in Scotland. It lists every Scottish football club to have won any of the three major domestic trophies, six major European competitions which have existed at different times, or the two global competitions FIFA has recognised. These honours consist of the Scottish football championship\u2014the Scottish Football League up to 1998, Scottish Premier League from 1998 to 2013 and the Scottish Professional Football League thereafter\u2014the Scottish Cup, the League Cup, the Champions League or its predecessor the European Cup, the now-defunct European Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Europa League or its predecessors the UEFA Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup or its predecessor the Intercontinental Cup.\n\ndoc425633: Old Firm. Hampden, Scotland's national stadium and home of Queen's Park, is situated roughly an equal distance from Ibrox and Celtic Park in Glasgow. Due to the frequency of the two teams appearing in semi-finals and finals held there (often facing one another), its West and East stands are always allocated to the same club and are informally known as the Rangers end and Celtic end respectively.[145][146] That stadium, once the largest in the world,[144][140] attracted the largest Old Firm attendance of all time with 132,870 at the 1969 Scottish Cup Final[140] (it is not the record for the competition, with 147,365 having attended the 1937 final which also featured Celtic, versus Aberdeen).[140][144] The record Scottish League Cup final attendance (107,609; October 1965) was an Old Firm affair,[140] although the tournament record was set in 1947 when Rangers overcame Hibernian in a semi-final before 123,830.[147]\n\ndoc176116: Scotland national rugby union team. Their greatest year in the modern era was 1990,[citation needed] when their season came down to one game, a Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield against the \"auld enemy\", England. Both sides had won all their Five Nations fixtures, and England were overwhelming favourites despite being the away side. Scotland under the captaincy of prop David Sole went on to win 13\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7,[35] and with it their third Grand Slam.[36] The match against England in 1990 was also only the second time that Flower of Scotland was played at Murrayfield, having become Scotland's pre-match national anthem that year.[37]\n\ndoc176137: Scotland national rugby union team. Victory over Samoa in November 2017[106] was followed by a breathtaking performance against New Zealand at a sold-out Murrayfield. Tries from Jonny Gray and Huw Jones brought Scotland to 17-22 with barely a minute to go, but it took a superb cover tackle from the All Blacks fly-half Beaudan Barrett to prevent Stuart Hogg from scoring a winning try.[107] A week later Scotland registered a record win over the Wallabies, inflicting eight tries on the visitors in what was the Australian hooker Stephen Moore's final international game. Scotland won 53-24, their biggest ever margin of victory over Australia.[108]\n\ndoc590924: Perfect season. Celtic went domestically unbeaten across the 2016\u201317 season over all 38 league games in Scotland, finishing 30 points clear of second-place Aberdeen with 34 wins and 4 draws. Celtic also won the 2016\u201317 Scottish League Cup and the 2016\u201317 Scottish Cup, giving them the accolade of being the only club to win a domestic treble unbeaten.[48][49]\n\ndoc2457728: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The match played in 1967 is Scotland's most famous victory against England.[19] England had won the 1966 FIFA World Cup at Wembley less than a year previously and were undefeated in 19 games.[19][25] Despite fielding four of the Celtic side that would go on to win the European Cup a month later and stars such as Denis Law, Jim Baxter and Billy Bremner, Scotland were massive underdogs going into the match.[19] Scotland took an early lead through a goal by Law, and Bobby Lennox put Scotland 2\u20130 up with just 12 minutes remaining.[19] England were somewhat hampered by the fact that Jack Charlton suffered an injury early in the game.[19][25] England manager Alf Ramsey was unable to substitute Charlton and therefore decided to use him in the unfamiliar role of centre forward.[19][25] Ironically, Charlton scored England's first goal.[19] Scotland soon reestablished a two-goal lead, however, with Jim McCalliog making the score 3\u20131.[19] Geoff Hurst scored a late goal to make the final score 3\u20132 to Scotland.[19]\n\ndoc2431697: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. Clubs with a valid Club License at the date of the draw are eligible for a bye to the second preliminary round.[6] Teams in Bold advanced to the first round.\n\ndoc2265559: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Health Education Group was the first organisation to sponsor the Scottish Cup in 1983 with the largest sponsorship package in Scottish football at the time, worth around \u00a3200,000.[47] The partnership was praised for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle linked with football.[41] The deal ended in 1989 when Tennent Caledonian Breweries won the sponsorship rights. Tennent's association with the tournament raised the debate about alcohol sponsorship within sports following the riots at the 1980 Scottish Cup Final which resulted in the sale of alcohol being banned at Scottish sporting events.[41] Despite this controversy, the partnership was largely successful and lasted 18 years until 2007. The SFA received around \u00a325 million over the duration of the sponsorship deal.[40] The Scottish Government in association with businessman Willie Haughey sponsored the Scottish Cup between 2008 and 2010. The 2008\u201309 competition was known as the Homecoming Scottish Cup to promote Scotland's year of homecoming and tourism.[43] The 2009\u201310 competition was known the Active Nation Scottish Cup to promote a healthy living through football.[44] Carling was an additional sponsor between 2010 and 2014 as the competition's official beer.[48] The current title sponsor is bookmaker William Hill.[45]\n\ndoc2457737: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. In the early 21st century there have again been suggestions that the British Home Championship should be restored to the schedule, or at least for the England v Scotland fixture to be played more regularly.[44][45] There was some speculation that England would invite Scotland to be their first opponents when Wembley Stadium was re-opened in 2007,[46] but this did not happen. There was further talk of organising a one-off England v Scotland match at the end of the 2007\u201308 season,[47] but the Scotland manager George Burley was opposed to this timing and the match was not arranged.[48] On 16 June 2012, The Football Association announced that England would play Scotland in August 2013 as part of their 150th anniversary celebrations.[49] England won an entertaining friendly fixture by 3\u20132, after Scotland had twice taken the lead.[50]\n\ndoc1815077: 2018\u201319 Scottish League Cup. Aberdeen, Celtic, Hibernian and Rangers entered the competition at this stage, after receiving a bye for the group stage due to their participation in UEFA club competitions.\n\ndoc2457717: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The BBC website has commented that the games \"have represented all that is good and all that is bad about football since the fixture began,\"[6] while The Guardian newspaper once reported that \"for millions across both sides of the border the encounter represents a chance for the ultimate victory over the enemy.\"[7] As of June 2017, the teams have played 114 matches; England have won 48, Scotland 41, and there have been 25 draws.[8]\n\n"

Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out;[5] in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed;[6] and in 1982, when the USSR went through.[7] Although Scotland have played at eight finals tournaments, they have qualified on nine occasions. The Scottish Football Association declined to participate in 1950 as Scotland were not the British champions.[8]\n\ndoc8271: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Craig Brown guided Scotland to qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, finishing as the best runners-up. Scotland were drawn against holders Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup.[32] John Collins scored from the penalty spot to level the score at 1\u20131, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2\u20131 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1\u20131 with Norway in Bordeaux,[2] but the final match against Morocco ended in a 3\u20130 defeat.[33] Scotland have not appeared at the World Cup since.\n\ndoc8263: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years.[10] A \"skilful but fragile\" team lost a play-off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962.[10] A team managed by Jock Stein, but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments, lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament.[10] A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970.[10]\n\ndoc8270: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France.[30] Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1\u20130 to Costa Rica.[31] While they recovered to beat Sweden 2\u20131 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1\u20130 and were once again eliminated after the first round.[31] Goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal.[10]\n\ndoc506798: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Under the guidance of manager Andy Roxburgh, Scotland qualified for the UEFA European Championship for the first time in 1992.[1] A 1\u20130 defeat to Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1\u20131 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through as group winners.[2] Despite competing well in defeats against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the CIS, the team was knocked out at the group stage.[2]\n\ndoc1378206: List of Scotland international footballers. The Scotland national football team is the joint-oldest international football team, having played in the first official international match, a goalless draw on 30 November 1872 against England.[1]  Since then, the team has established a long-standing rivalry with England, particularly in the annual British Home Championship, which Scotland won 24 times outright and shared a further 17 times.[2] The team has enjoyed less success in continental and global competition. Even though Scotland has participated in eight FIFA World Cup and two UEFA European Championship final tournaments,[3] the team has never progressed beyond the first round of any major tournament.[3]\n\ndoc8268: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8269: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc176145: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland has competed in every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987. Their best finish was fourth in 1991.[38] In their semi-final on 26 October 1991 Scotland lost 6\u20139 to England at Murrayfield after Gavin Hastings missed a penalty almost in front of and a short distance from the posts. On 30 October Scotland lost the third-place play-off to New Zealand in Cardiff 13\u20136.[38] Since then they have qualified for the quarter-finals in all but one occasion, in 2011.[80] Their most recent world cup campaign in 2015 saw them come within 30 seconds of a famous win over Australia, however a last minute penalty sealed the win for the Wallabies.[95]\n\ndoc506797: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Scotland have participated in two UEFA European Football Championships finals, those held in 1992 and 1996. They have played six matches: winning two, drawing one and losing three. They have scored four goals and conceded five.\n\ndoc176135: Scotland national rugby union team. In the 2017 Six Nations, Scotland saw a marked improvement in performance with three home wins and two away defeats. This was Vern Cotter's last tournament as head coach of Scotland, despite their also beating Australia 24-19 on the summer tour of the Southern Hemisphere. In their first 6Ns game, Scotland went in with confidence to win their first opening match for eleven years against Ireland in a close match at Murrayfield Stadium.[101][102] This followed with a defeat in Paris to France. Scotland secured a win over Wales in their third game, Scotland's first since 2007. In the eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup tie against England at Twickenham,[103] however, Scotland were thrashed 61-21.[104] This was a record defeat against the English, and a result which ended their hopes of winning the Six Nations.[104] In the last week, Scotland defeated Italy at Murrayfield with a 29-0 victory, securing fourth place in the tournament table.[105]\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc176124: Scotland national rugby union team. In the first match of the 2006 Six Nations campaign, against France, Scotland won 20\u201316,[55] and this was the first time since 1999 that they had beaten France.[56] Scotland also beat England 18\u201312 at home at Murrayfield to reclaim the Calcutta Cup.[57] In the 2006 Autumn internationals Scotland won two of three fixtures. They convincingly beat Romania[58] and put up a solid first half performance against the Pacific Islanders.[59] In the final match against Australia, Scotland failed to impress, with Australia winning 44\u201315.[60]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc176129: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland had a poor showing in the 2011 Six Nations, winning just one match, a 21\u20138 victory over Italy.[76] In the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Scotland struggled to beat Romania 34\u201324 and Georgia 15\u20136,[77][78] before losing 13\u201312 to Argentina.[79] Needing a win going into their final match against England in Auckland, they led 12\u20133 with a quarter of the game to go, only to lose out to a Chris Ashton try, going down 16\u201312. This was the first time Scotland had been knocked out in the group stages of the Rugby World Cup.[80]\n\ndoc1616474: United Kingdom national football team. England have been the only Home Nation to have any major success internationally, winning the 1966 World Cup. Scotland have qualified for the final tournaments of eight World Cups and two European Championships, but have never progressed beyond the group stage of any international tournament.  Northern Ireland have not qualified for a World Cup finals tournament since 1986, and Wales since 1958.\n\ndoc176096: Scotland national rugby union team. The Scottish rugby team dates back to 1871, where they beat England in the first international rugby union match at Raeburn Place. Scotland competed in the Five Nations from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright\u2014including the last ever Five Nations in 1999\u2014and sharing it another 8. In 2000 the competition accepted a sixth competitor, Italy, thus forming the Six Nations. Since this change, Scotland have yet to win the competition. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all eight competitions, the most recent being in 2015 where they were knocked out by Australia at the quarter-final stage in controversial circumstances. Their best finish came in 1991, where they lost to the All Blacks in the third place play-off.\n\ndoc8262: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8267: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. After taking a single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress.[6] Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever;[19] Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net.[19][24] The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, however, as Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.[6] This performance against strong opponents only heightened the frustration at the poor results earlier in the competition.[10] MacLeod initially retained his position, but resigned later that year.[10]\n\ndoc176117: Scotland national rugby union team. The second World Cup took place in 1991 with matches shared between the Five Nations. Scotland won their pool, though the game against Ireland was close, and then beat Western Samoa in the quarter-final. They lost to England in the semi-final held at Murrayfield to a Rob Andrew drop goal. In the third place play-off they were beaten by New Zealand.[38]\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc8265: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland appointed Ally MacLeod as manager in 1977. Scotland qualified for the 1978 FIFA World Cup with victories over Czechoslovakia and Wales.[18] During the build-up to the tournament, MacLeod fuelled the hopes of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home from Argentina with a medal.[19] As the squad left for the finals, they were given an enthusiastic send off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park.[20] Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America.[19] This enthusiasm was not just generated internally, as respected coaches such as Rinus Michels and Miljan Miljani\u0107 rated Scotland amongst the favourites to win the competition.[10][21] The Royal Mail commissioned designs of commemorative stamps that would have been circulated if Scotland had won the World Cup.[22]\n\ndoc2265541: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup,[1] commonly known as the Scottish Cup,[2][3] is an annual association football knock-out cup competition for men's football clubs in Scotland.[1] The competition was first held in 1873\u201374. Entry is open to all clubs with full or associate membership of the Scottish Football Association (SFA).[4] The competition is called the William Hill Scottish Cup for sponsorship reasons.[5][6]\n\ndoc176128: Scotland national rugby union team. In the 2010 Six Nations Scotland lost against France, Wales and Italy before drawing with England. Against Ireland, in the final rugby match at Croke Park, Scotland gained their only win of the tournament 23\u201320 with a last-minute penalty by Dan Parks, denying the Irish the Triple Crown and assuring they themselves would avoid the wooden spoon.[73] That summer, Scotland toured Argentina and recorded their first ever away series victory, beating the Pumas in both tests, 24\u201316 and 13\u20139.[74] In the Autumn Internationals of 2010, Scotland lost heavily against New Zealand before recording victories against South Africa, 21\u201317, and Samoa, 19\u201316.[75]\n\ndoc2457740: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. England and Scotland have played each other more than any other nation, playing 113 official matches.[56][57] England have the better record overall in the fixture, with 48 wins to Scotland's 41.[58] There have been 24 draws, only three of them goalless, with 98 years separating the first and second of those matches.[58] England have scored 195 goals to 171 by Scotland.[58] The record margin of victory in the fixture was England's 9\u20133 win in 1961,[58] while Scotland's biggest victory was 7\u20132 in 1878.[58] The record attendance of 149,415, which is also a European record attendance, was set at Hampden Park in 1937.[19]\n\ndoc176119: Scotland national rugby union team. The third World Cup, held in South Africa, came in 1995. Pool play saw a narrow defeat by France, thanks to an injury-time try, and Scotland finished second in the pool. They were eliminated in the quarter-final against New Zealand.[41]\n\ndoc506799: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. After Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Andy Roxburgh was replaced by Craig Brown as Scotland manager.[3] Brown successfully guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament, in second place behind Russia.[3] The first game at the tournament against the Netherlands ended 0\u20130, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against rivals England at Wembley Stadium.[3] Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2\u20130 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1\u20130 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4\u20130 lead in the other match briefly put both teams in a position to qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were eliminated on goals scored.[3] The Netherlands and Scotland both had four points and a goal difference of minus one.[4]\n\ndoc176115: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland went to the first World Cup, played in New Zealand and Australia in the summer of 1987. John Rutherford, the team's general and controlling influence, had injured his knee on an unauthorised tour of Bermuda. He broke down after less than a quarter of an hour of the first World Cup match against France and never played for Scotland again. Scotland had been in the lead but the match finished level. Scotland lost to New Zealand in the quarter-final. On 27 June 1988, Ian McGeechan was appointed as head coach to succeed Derrick Grant who had retired after the end of the 1988 Five Nations series.[34]\n\ndoc2265547: Scottish Cup. Clubs that are not members of the SFA may still qualify for the tournament by winning the Highland League, Lowland League, East or South of Scotland football leagues. Clubs that are members of the Scottish Junior Football Association (SJFA) have been able to qualify since 2007 by winning one of the three regional Super League divisions or by winning the Scottish Junior Cup.[10] Three junior clubs, Banks O' Dee, Girvan and Linlithgow Rose are also SFA members and therefore qualify automatically. From 2015, the winners of the Scottish Amateur Cup are also eligible to qualify.[11]\n\ndoc176120: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland won the last-ever Five Nations Championship in 1999 with a last minute win by Wales over England.[42] However, in the 1999 World Cup they suffered a quarter-final defeat to New Zealand.[43]\n\ndoc2265551: Scottish Cup. As Scotland is a member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the winner of the Scottish Cup qualifies to compete in European-wide competitions organised by UEFA. Between 1960 and 1998, the Scottish Cup winners qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup along with winners of other domestic cup competitions across Europe before it was abolished.[17] The Scottish Cup winners now qualify to compete in the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly known as the UEFA Cup).[18] It is possible for the Scottish Cup winners to have already qualified for a UEFA competition through their league ranking in the Scottish Premiership. In this scenario the qualification spot passes to the highest ranked team in that competition not yet qualified, rather than to the Scottish Cup runners-up.[19][20] Until 2014, the Scottish Cup runners-up qualified for European competition if the cup winners had also qualified for the Champions League.[20]\n\ndoc176121: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland endured a torrid Six Nations in 2000, losing their first four straight games.[44] but won the final game against England 19\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13 under captain Andy Nicol.[45]\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc983191: List of Scottish Cup finals. The Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the Scottish Cup, is a knockout cup competition in Scottish football. Organised by the Scottish Football Association, it is the third oldest existing football competition in the world, having commenced in the 1873\u201374 season just two years after the first FA Cup. The winners are awarded the world's oldest trophy, minted in 1885.[1]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc2265552: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Football Association was founded in 1873 and the Scottish Cup was created as an annual competition for its members.[21] The first Scottish Cup match took place on 18 October 1873 when Renton defeated Kilmarnock FC 2\u20130 in the first round.[22] In its early years the competition was dominated by Queen's Park who won the final 10 times in the first twenty years.[23] Vale of Leven, Dumbarton and Renton were also successful during this period.[4] In 1885, the record margin of victory in the tournament was recorded when Arbroath defeated Bon Accord 36\u20130 in a first round match.[4][23]\n\ndoc176097: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland have a strong rivalry with the English national team. They both annually compete for the Calcutta Cup. Each year, this fixture is played out as part of the Six Nations, with Scotland having last won in 2018.\n\ndoc8266: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland's first game was against Peru in C\u00f3rdoba. Two spectacular goals by Te\u00f3filo Cubillas meant that the result was a 3\u20131 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1\u20131 draw against Iran.[19] The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.[23] MacLeod had made strange selection choices, picking inexperienced full-backs and retaining the out-of-form Bruce Rioch and Don Masson.[10]\n\ndoc312850: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won.

Scotland opened their 2008 Six Nations campaign losing 27\u20136 to France at home.[63] Pressure on Frank Hadden started to intensify after Scotland lost to Wales[64] and then to Ireland.[65] They then defeated England in the Calcutta Cup with a 15\u20139 victory[66] before succumbing to Italy, avoiding the wooden spoon only on scoring difference.[67] They then toured Argentina in the summer to play two tests against Argentina. They lost the first test 21\u201315, but won the second 26\u201314.[68]\n\ndoc983194: List of Scottish Cup finals. In 1909 the cup was withheld by the SFA after a riot broke out following a replay between Rangers and Celtic. The first match was drawn 2\u20132 and the second 1\u20131.[7]\n\ndoc176112: Scotland national rugby union team. Jim Telfer became national coach in 1980,[23] inheriting a squad of genuine potential.[22] In March 1982 Scotland won away in Wales for the first time in 20 years.[24] Scotland toured Australia in July 1982 and won the first test, Scotland's first away victory against any of the big three Southern Hemisphere sides.[25][26] After this, the 1983 season was a disappointment; losing their first three Five Nations matches.[27] However, the tournament ended on a high when Scotland recorded only their second victory over England at Twickenham since 1938.[23] Scotland then went on to draw with the All Blacks 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 in the late autumn.[27]\n\ndoc1051360: Scotland. Scotland contested the first ever international football game in 1872 against England.[348] The match took place at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow, home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club. Scottish clubs have been successful in European competitions with Celtic winning the European Cup in 1967, Rangers and Aberdeen winning the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and 1983 respectively, and Aberdeen also winning the UEFA Super Cup in 1983.\n\ndoc2431703: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup.

Scotland eventually went out of the championship on goal difference, but would have proceeded beyond the first round of a tournament for the first time in their history had England not conceded a late goal in their 4\u20131 defeat of the Netherlands in their next game.[37] The Guardian newspaper later commented that \"England fans' joy was complete when Patrick Kluivert stole a late goal for the Dutch \u2013 and thereby deprived Scotland of a place in the quarter-finals\".[38]\n\ndoc1051359: Scotland. Scotland hosts its own national sporting competitions and has independent representation at several international sporting events, including the FIFA World Cup, the Rugby Union World Cup, the Rugby League World Cup, the Cricket World Cup, the Netball World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. Scotland has its own national governing bodies, such as the Scottish Football Association (the second oldest national football association in the world)[345] and the Scottish Rugby Union. Variations of football have been played in Scotland for centuries, with the earliest reference dating back to 1424.[346] Association football is the most popular sport and the Scottish Cup is the world's oldest national trophy.[347]\n\ndoc2265556: Scottish Cup. Some clubs have become renowned for eliminating higher ranked clubs from the tournament despite being underdogs. Division Two club East Fife won the tournament in 1938 by defeating Division One club Kilmarnock, the first team from outside the top-tier of league football to win the trophy. East Fife had previously reached the final in 1927 after eliminating three higher ranked clubs in the preceding rounds.[33] Hibernian became the second second-tier side to win the cup as they defeated Rangers, another second-tier side, in the 2016 final. Only one other club from outside the top-tier of league football has won the competition; non-league Queen's Park defeated Celtic in the 1893 final.[note 2] Several other clubs have reached the final whilst competing outside the top-tier of league football, but were defeated in the final. These include Dumbarton, Kilmarnock, Airdrieonians, Falkirk (twice), Gretna, Queen of the South and Ross County.\n\ndoc2457722: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. According to The Scotsman newspaper of 2 December 1872, there were only about ten football clubs in Scotland. These early international matches helped to increase the popularity of association football in Scotland.[18] The first official match was held on 30 November 1872, on Scotland's national saint's day, St. Andrew's Day, and it took place at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club.[19][20] The Scotland team was made up entirely of players from Queen's Park,[19] the most successful Scottish club of the period.[20] The game ended a 0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 draw, watched by a crowd of 4000 who had paid a shilling each for admission.[19][20]\n\ndoc176133: Scotland national rugby union team. The 2015 Six Nations Championship ended in a whitewash for Scotland, despite optimism amongst players and supporters beforehand.[93] However, Scotland displayed improved performances in their World Cup warm-up games over the summer, with two wins over Italy and narrow defeats away in Ireland and France.[94] Scotland played well at the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England; qualifying from their group by beating Japan, USA and Samoa, although they lost to South Africa. Scotland played Australia in the quarter-finals, and with 30 seconds remaining led 34\u00e2\u20ac\u201c32. However, referee Craig Joubert then awarded the Wallabies a highly controversial penalty, later judged by the game's ruling body to be incorrect, which Bernard Foley scored to give Australia victory.[95][96]\n\ndoc2431695: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. 15 clubs were involved in the draw, of which nine received a bye to the second preliminary round, while the other six entered the first preliminary round. The teams competing in these rounds were made up of teams from the East of Scotland Football League (5), South of Scotland Football League (3), North Caledonian Football League (1), Scottish Junior Football Association (4) and the Scottish Amateur Football Association (2). Glenafton Athletic took part in the Scottish Cup for the first time after winning the 2016\u201317 West of Scotland Super League Premier Division and the 2016\u201317 Scottish Junior Cup.\n\ndoc176105: Scotland national rugby union team. Internationals resumed in the 1946\u201347 season, although these were not formally recognised and no caps were awarded to participating players.[6] In January 1946, Scotland played and defeated a strong New Zealand Armed Forces team by 11\u20136.[9][10] Scotland resumed full international matches in February 1947, losing 22\u20138 to Wales at Murrayfield.[6]\n\ndoc2230756: Aberdeen F.C.. Halliday's place in the Aberdeen Hall of Fame was secured after the war when he became the first manager to bring national trophies to Pittodrie. Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup in the 1945\u201346 season, defeating Rangers 3\u20132 at Hampden.[16] They then reached the 1947 Scottish Cup final, defeating Hibernian 2\u20131 with George Hamilton, signed from Halliday's former club Queen of the South, scoring to gain the club's first major trophy.[14][18] From this early success, Halliday's side reached two more Scottish Cup finals, in 1953 and 1954, though they lost both.[14] Halliday's team were not to be denied, however, and the following season, 1954\u201355, Aberdeen won their first Scottish League title.[14][18] Though league winners, the club did not participate in the first European Cup competition\u2014Scotland's place was awarded to Hibernian, who took part by special invitation.[19]\n\ndoc2431691: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. The 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 Scottish Cup was the 133rd season of Scotland's most prestigious football knockout competition. The tournament was sponsored by bookmaker William Hill in what is the seventh season of a nine-year partnership, after contract negotiations saw the initial five-year contract extended for an additional four years in October 2015.[2]\n\ndoc176103: Scotland national rugby union team. In 1926, Scotland became the first Home nation side to defeat England at Twickenham after England had won the Grand Slam five times in eight seasons.[5][8]\n\ndoc1692965: Rangers F.C. in European football.

Scotland were defeated 3\u20132 at Craven Cottage on 22 March 1976.[13][14]\n\ndoc312848: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. European competition started in 1955 with the European Cup and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which was succeeded by the UEFA Cup for the 1971\u201372 season. The Cup Winners' Cup followed in 1960 but was discontinued in 1999. Three Scottish teams have lifted at least one European trophy. Celtic won the European Cup in 1967, Rangers won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and Aberdeen won the Cup Winners' Cup and Super Cup in 1983. Intercontinental competition started in 1960 with the Intercontinental Cup, which consisted of a two-legged tie between the European Cup and the South American Copa Libertadores winners from 1960 to 1979. To date, Celtic are the only Scottish club to participate in an intercontinental competition, losing the 1967 Intercontinental Cup to Racing Club.[1]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc2391832: Scottish Premier League. In 2003, Celtic became the first Scottish club since Dundee United in 1987 to reach a European final, eventually losing 3\u20132 to Porto after extra time in the UEFA Cup final.[23] In 2003\u201304, two Scottish clubs, Celtic and Rangers, qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time. In 2005\u201306, Rangers became the first Scottish club to reach the knockout stage of the Champions League,[24] a feat repeated by Celtic the following two seasons.[25][26] In the 2007\u201308 season, three Scottish clubs were competing in Europe after Christmas for the first time since 1970,[27] while in the same season, Rangers reached the 2008 UEFA Cup final, but lost 2\u20130 to Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg.[28] During the season, Scotland's European representatives collected the most coefficient points since the 1982\u201383 season.[20]\n\ndoc2431692: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. The defending champions were Celtic who won the 2017 Scottish Cup Final on 27 May 2017.[3]\n\ndoc176118: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland went through 1994 without a single win,[39] but bounced back in 1995 to win their first three Five Nations matches.[40] This run of wins included a 23\u201321 win away against France, courtesy of a last minute try and conversion by Gavin Hastings.[39] This was Scotland's first win in Paris since 1969.[39][40] The last Five Nations match was another Grand Slam decider against England, however this time the English defeated the Scots 24\u201312, largely due to the kicking prowess of Rob Andrew.[40]\n\ndoc983192: List of Scottish Cup finals. Celtic hold the record for most wins with 37, and the most final appearances with 56. Celtic are also the current holders, having beaten Aberdeen 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 in the 2017 final.\n\ndoc176144: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland competes annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: France, England, Ireland, Italy and Wales.[5] The Six Nations started out as the Home Nations Championship in 1883, with Scotland sharing the championship with England in 1886 before winning the title outright for the first time a year later.[5] Scotland have won the title outright 15 times and shared the championship a further nine times. Scotland have won three Grand Slams (including the Triple Crown) in 1925, 1984 and 1990, in addition to a further seven Triple Crowns.[5] They also contest the Calcutta Cup with England as part of the championship.[5] Scotland were the winners of the last Five Nations in 1999, before Italy joined the competition to make it the Six Nations.[5]\n\ndoc2457741: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. Scotland long held an advantage in terms of wins, as they recorded ten wins in the first 16 matches. Scotland, the smaller country in terms of population, were superior during this period because passing football developed earlier there, as shown by the Scotch Professors who moved to play in the nascent English professional league during the late 1880s.[59] Scotland were also dominant in the 1920s and 30s and prior to the Second World War had 29 wins in the series to England's 19. England reversed the dominance after the war, as Scotland have only won 12 matches since then. The Scots did win three games out of four from 1974 to 1977, but lost every other game in the 1970s, and have only won three times (compared to 13 English wins) since 1977. England pulled ahead for the first time in the history of the fixture with their win in 1983.\n\ndoc2265554: Scottish Cup. A total of 34 clubs have appeared in the final, of whom 25 have won the competition.[29] The most successful club in terms of wins and appearances in the final is Celtic, with 37 wins from 56.[30] Celtic and Rangers have finished runners-up on more occasions than any other club with 18 defeats each in the final.[30] The most recent winner is Celtic, who defeated Aberdeen 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 in the 2017 final.[30]\n\ndoc312847: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. Competitive football started in Scotland with the Scottish Cup, the second oldest football competition in the world, which was first held in the 1873\u201374 season. League football followed when the Scottish Football League was founded in 1890, with Dumbarton and Rangers sharing the first title. The Scottish Football League remained the highest division of the Scottish football league system until 1998, when the Scottish Premier League was founded. The Scottish Football League also added a second major cup competition in 1946, when it founded the League Cup, invititation to which is restricted to the 42 members of the league. Rangers have won a record number of league championships and League Cups, while Celtic have won a record number of Scottish Cups.\n\ndoc2265543: Scottish Cup.

Scotland were terrible during the 2012 Six Nations, picking up the wooden spoon and being whitewashed, despite promising moments,[81] and falling to 12th, Scotland's lowest ever in the IRB rankings.[82] Even after this whitewash, Scotland defeated Australia 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 in the 2012 Scotland rugby union tour of Australia, Fiji and Samoa. This was Scotland's first win in Australia since 1982 and the first time in 30 years that Scotland defeated Australia more than once in a row.[83] Scotland also recorded away wins over both Fiji and Samoa.[84] During Scotland's 2012 Autumn Tests they suffered a series of defeats, versus the All Blacks, South Africa and most notably Tonga, which caused head coach Andy Robinson to resign.[85] Scott Johnson became interim Head Coach for the team in December 2012.[86]\n\ndoc897513: 2015 Cricket World Cup. Scotland defeated the United Arab Emirates in the final of the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier and both teams qualified for the last two spots in the 2015 Cricket World Cup.[26]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\ndoc2457725: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The only exception to this pattern of annual fixtures in the spring was in 1973, when there were two games. The first game that year was a friendly match that marked the centenary of the Scottish Football Association. There were also two fixtures staged in 1902, but this was because the first game had to be abandoned due to the first Ibrox disaster. The British Home Championship also acted as qualifiers for three major tournaments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 1950 World Cup, the 1954 World Cup and the 1968 European Championship.\n\ndoc2265546: Scottish Cup. Any club that is a full or associate member of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) is entitled to compete in the tournament and qualifies automatically.[1] Every team that plays in the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is therefore eligible. Between 1895 and 2007, clubs that were SFA members but not competitors in the country's professional football leagues could only qualify for the tournament by winning the Scottish Qualifying Cup.[10]\n\ndoc312849: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. Domestic League\nLeague = Scottish league champions (since 1890)\n\ndoc176095: Scotland national rugby union team. The Scotland national rugby union team is administered by the Scottish Rugby Union. The team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and participates in the Rugby World Cup, which takes place every four years. As of 26\u00a0February\u00a02018[update], Scotland are 5th in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\ndoc176114: Scotland national rugby union team. In January 1986, a trial match between \"Blues\" (players expected to feature for Scotland) and \"Reds\" (emerging players with a possible international future) resulted in a shock 41\u201310 win for the \"Reds\".[30] The \"Reds\" team included Gavin and Scott Hastings, Finlay Calder and David Sole, all of whom who would debut for Scotland in the Five Nations that year and feature prominently for side in the years that followed.[31] Scotland went on to share the 1986 Five Nations championship with France, each side winning three out of their four games.[32] The series also saw Scotland thrash England 33\u20136 at Murrayfield; Scotland's record win over the English, at the time one point short of Scotland's best score in any rugby union international and England's heaviest defeat in over a century.[33]\n\ndoc180689: Scottish independence referendum, 2014. Former Labour first minister Henry McLeish published a report in May 2014 that found no obvious barriers to an independent Scotland competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[285] McLeish said that some athletes, particularly those in team sports, may choose to compete for the existing Great Britain team rather than Scotland, as they would be nationals of both states.[285] International Olympic Committee representative Craig Reedie pointed out that Scotland would need to obtain United Nations membership and may want to set its own Olympic qualifying standards, which would need to be done in the period between independence (March 2016) and the closing date for entries (July 2016).[285][286]\n\ndoc2431699: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. The first round took place on the weekend of 23 September 2017. Along with the six winners from the second preliminary round, there were 30 new entries at this stage, 14 from the Lowland Football League and 16 from the Highland Football League.[6]\n\ndoc983196: List of Scottish Cup finals. A draw in the final used to result in the match being replayed at a later date. Since the 1981 final, however, the result has always been decided on the day, with a penalty shootout if required after extra time.\n\ndoc2457743: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. Rangers defeated Leeds United home and away to qualify for the first Champions League group stage in 1992\u201393. Celtic lost on the away goals rule to Liverpool in the 1997\u201398 UEFA Cup, but they beat Blackburn Rovers and Liverpool on their run to the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.[65] Celtic and Manchester United were drawn together twice in the Champions League group phase in quick succession, in 2006\u201307 and 2008\u201309,[65] while Arsenal beat Celtic 5\u20131 on aggregate in the 2009\u201310 qualifiers.\n\ndoc2457724: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. From the first match in late 1872, England and Scotland played each other in the spring of every year (except during World War I and World War II) until 1989. From 1884 until 1984, the match was the highlight of the annual British Home Championship played between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[note 1] After the British Home Championship ended in 1984, the annual England v Scotland fixture continued in the form of the Rous Cup until 1989.\n\ndoc1072912: 1998 FIFA World Cup. Scotland managed only one point, coming in a 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 draw against Norway, and failed to get out of the first round for an eighth time in the FIFA World Cup, a record that stands to this date.\n\ndoc1057503: 1938 Scottish Cup Final. The 1938 Scottish Cup Final was played on 23 April 1938 at Hampden Park in Glasgow and was the final of the 60th Scottish Cup. East Fife and Kilmarnock contested the match. Following a 1\u20131 draw the match was replayed on 27 April 1938, at the end of normal time the score was 2\u20132. East Fife then went on to win the match 4\u20132 to win their only Scottish Cup, helmed by their manager David McLean.\n\ndoc1815072: 2018\u201319 Scottish League Cup. The competition began with eight groups of five teams. The four clubs competing in the UEFA Champions League (Celtic) and Europa League (Aberdeen, Hibernian and Rangers) qualifying rounds were given a bye through to the second round. The 40 teams competing in the group stage consisted of the other eight teams that competed in the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership, and all of the teams that competed in the 2017\u201318 Scottish Championship, 2017\u201318 Scottish League One and 2017\u201318 Scottish League Two, as well as the 2017\u201318 Highland Football League and the 2017\u201318 Lowland Football League champions.\n\ndoc2457723: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The first goal between the two sides was scored by England's William Kenyon-Slaney[21] in the next game at The Oval, the first official match between the two in England, which the English won 4\u20132 on 8 March 1873.[18] Following this, the game became an annual event, being held in England or Scotland in alternate years.[18] Scotland took their first win in the fixture in the 1874 game, again played at Hamilton Crescent, where they defeated England 2\u20131.[22] Later in the 1870s Scotland won the fixture three times in a row, including a 7\u20132 victory in the 1878 game.[18]\n\ndoc312846: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. This is a list of the major honours won by football clubs in Scotland. It lists every Scottish football club to have won any of the three major domestic trophies, six major European competitions which have existed at different times, or the two global competitions FIFA has recognised. These honours consist of the Scottish football championship\u2014the Scottish Football League up to 1998, Scottish Premier League from 1998 to 2013 and the Scottish Professional Football League thereafter\u2014the Scottish Cup, the League Cup, the Champions League or its predecessor the European Cup, the now-defunct European Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Europa League or its predecessors the UEFA Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup or its predecessor the Intercontinental Cup.\n\ndoc425633: Old Firm. Hampden, Scotland's national stadium and home of Queen's Park, is situated roughly an equal distance from Ibrox and Celtic Park in Glasgow. Due to the frequency of the two teams appearing in semi-finals and finals held there (often facing one another), its West and East stands are always allocated to the same club and are informally known as the Rangers end and Celtic end respectively.[145][146] That stadium, once the largest in the world,[144][140] attracted the largest Old Firm attendance of all time with 132,870 at the 1969 Scottish Cup Final[140] (it is not the record for the competition, with 147,365 having attended the 1937 final which also featured Celtic, versus Aberdeen).[140][144] The record Scottish League Cup final attendance (107,609; October 1965) was an Old Firm affair,[140] although the tournament record was set in 1947 when Rangers overcame Hibernian in a semi-final before 123,830.[147]\n\ndoc176116: Scotland national rugby union team. Their greatest year in the modern era was 1990,[citation needed] when their season came down to one game, a Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield against the \"auld enemy\", England. Both sides had won all their Five Nations fixtures, and England were overwhelming favourites despite being the away side. Scotland under the captaincy of prop David Sole went on to win 13\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7,[35] and with it their third Grand Slam.[36] The match against England in 1990 was also only the second time that Flower of Scotland was played at Murrayfield, having become Scotland's pre-match national anthem that year.[37]\n\ndoc176137: Scotland national rugby union team. Victory over Samoa in November 2017[106] was followed by a breathtaking performance against New Zealand at a sold-out Murrayfield. Tries from Jonny Gray and Huw Jones brought Scotland to 17-22 with barely a minute to go, but it took a superb cover tackle from the All Blacks fly-half Beaudan Barrett to prevent Stuart Hogg from scoring a winning try.[107] A week later Scotland registered a record win over the Wallabies, inflicting eight tries on the visitors in what was the Australian hooker Stephen Moore's final international game. Scotland won 53-24, their biggest ever margin of victory over Australia.[108]\n\ndoc590924: Perfect season. Celtic went domestically unbeaten across the 2016\u201317 season over all 38 league games in Scotland, finishing 30 points clear of second-place Aberdeen with 34 wins and 4 draws. Celtic also won the 2016\u201317 Scottish League Cup and the 2016\u201317 Scottish Cup, giving them the accolade of being the only club to win a domestic treble unbeaten.[48][49]\n\ndoc2457728: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The match played in 1967 is Scotland's most famous victory against England.[19] England had won the 1966 FIFA World Cup at Wembley less than a year previously and were undefeated in 19 games.[19][25] Despite fielding four of the Celtic side that would go on to win the European Cup a month later and stars such as Denis Law, Jim Baxter and Billy Bremner, Scotland were massive underdogs going into the match.[19] Scotland took an early lead through a goal by Law, and Bobby Lennox put Scotland 2\u20130 up with just 12 minutes remaining.[19] England were somewhat hampered by the fact that Jack Charlton suffered an injury early in the game.[19][25] England manager Alf Ramsey was unable to substitute Charlton and therefore decided to use him in the unfamiliar role of centre forward.[19][25] Ironically, Charlton scored England's first goal.[19] Scotland soon reestablished a two-goal lead, however, with Jim McCalliog making the score 3\u20131.[19] Geoff Hurst scored a late goal to make the final score 3\u20132 to Scotland.[19]\n\ndoc2431697: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. Clubs with a valid Club License at the date of the draw are eligible for a bye to the second preliminary round.[6] Teams in Bold advanced to the first round.\n\ndoc2265559: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Health Education Group was the first organisation to sponsor the Scottish Cup in 1983 with the largest sponsorship package in Scottish football at the time, worth around \u00a3200,000.[47] The partnership was praised for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle linked with football.[41] The deal ended in 1989 when Tennent Caledonian Breweries won the sponsorship rights. Tennent's association with the tournament raised the debate about alcohol sponsorship within sports following the riots at the 1980 Scottish Cup Final which resulted in the sale of alcohol being banned at Scottish sporting events.[41] Despite this controversy, the partnership was largely successful and lasted 18 years until 2007. The SFA received around \u00a325 million over the duration of the sponsorship deal.[40] The Scottish Government in association with businessman Willie Haughey sponsored the Scottish Cup between 2008 and 2010. The 2008\u201309 competition was known as the Homecoming Scottish Cup to promote Scotland's year of homecoming and tourism.[43] The 2009\u201310 competition was known the Active Nation Scottish Cup to promote a healthy living through football.[44] Carling was an additional sponsor between 2010 and 2014 as the competition's official beer.[48] The current title sponsor is bookmaker William Hill.[45]\n\ndoc2457737: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. In the early 21st century there have again been suggestions that the British Home Championship should be restored to the schedule, or at least for the England v Scotland fixture to be played more regularly.[44][45] There was some speculation that England would invite Scotland to be their first opponents when Wembley Stadium was re-opened in 2007,[46] but this did not happen. There was further talk of organising a one-off England v Scotland match at the end of the 2007\u201308 season,[47] but the Scotland manager George Burley was opposed to this timing and the match was not arranged.[48] On 16 June 2012, The Football Association announced that England would play Scotland in August 2013 as part of their 150th anniversary celebrations.[49] England won an entertaining friendly fixture by 3\u20132, after Scotland had twice taken the lead.[50]\n\ndoc1815077: 2018\u201319 Scottish League Cup. Aberdeen, Celtic, Hibernian and Rangers entered the competition at this stage, after receiving a bye for the group stage due to their participation in UEFA club competitions.\n\ndoc2457717: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The BBC website has commented that the games \"have represented all that is good and all that is bad about football since the fixture began,\"[6] while The Guardian newspaper once reported that \"for millions across both sides of the border the encounter represents a chance for the ultimate victory over the enemy.\"[7] As of June 2017, the teams have played 114 matches; England have won 48, Scotland 41, and there have been 25 draws.[8]\n\n"

Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out;[5] in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed;[6] and in 1982, when the USSR went through.[7] Although Scotland have played at eight finals tournaments, they have qualified on nine occasions. The Scottish Football Association declined to participate in 1950 as Scotland were not the British champions.[8]\n\ndoc8271: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Craig Brown guided Scotland to qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, finishing as the best runners-up. Scotland were drawn against holders Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup.[32] John Collins scored from the penalty spot to level the score at 1\u20131, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2\u20131 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1\u20131 with Norway in Bordeaux,[2] but the final match against Morocco ended in a 3\u20130 defeat.[33] Scotland have not appeared at the World Cup since.\n\ndoc8263: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years.[10] A \"skilful but fragile\" team lost a play-off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962.[10] A team managed by Jock Stein, but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments, lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament.[10] A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970.[10]\n\ndoc8270: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France.[30] Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1\u20130 to Costa Rica.[31] While they recovered to beat Sweden 2\u20131 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1\u20130 and were once again eliminated after the first round.[31] Goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal.[10]\n\ndoc506798: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Under the guidance of manager Andy Roxburgh, Scotland qualified for the UEFA European Championship for the first time in 1992.[1] A 1\u20130 defeat to Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1\u20131 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through as group winners.[2] Despite competing well in defeats against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the CIS, the team was knocked out at the group stage.[2]\n\ndoc1378206: List of Scotland international footballers. The Scotland national football team is the joint-oldest international football team, having played in the first official international match, a goalless draw on 30 November 1872 against England.[1]  Since then, the team has established a long-standing rivalry with England, particularly in the annual British Home Championship, which Scotland won 24 times outright and shared a further 17 times.[2] The team has enjoyed less success in continental and global competition. Even though Scotland has participated in eight FIFA World Cup and two UEFA European Championship final tournaments,[3] the team has never progressed beyond the first round of any major tournament.[3]\n\ndoc8268: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8269: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc176145: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland has competed in every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987. Their best finish was fourth in 1991.[38] In their semi-final on 26 October 1991 Scotland lost 6\u20139 to England at Murrayfield after Gavin Hastings missed a penalty almost in front of and a short distance from the posts. On 30 October Scotland lost the third-place play-off to New Zealand in Cardiff 13\u20136.[38] Since then they have qualified for the quarter-finals in all but one occasion, in 2011.[80] Their most recent world cup campaign in 2015 saw them come within 30 seconds of a famous win over Australia, however a last minute penalty sealed the win for the Wallabies.[95]\n\ndoc506797: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Scotland have participated in two UEFA European Football Championships finals, those held in 1992 and 1996. They have played six matches: winning two, drawing one and losing three. They have scored four goals and conceded five.\n\ndoc176135: Scotland national rugby union team. In the 2017 Six Nations, Scotland saw a marked improvement in performance with three home wins and two away defeats. This was Vern Cotter's last tournament as head coach of Scotland, despite their also beating Australia 24-19 on the summer tour of the Southern Hemisphere. In their first 6Ns game, Scotland went in with confidence to win their first opening match for eleven years against Ireland in a close match at Murrayfield Stadium.[101][102] This followed with a defeat in Paris to France. Scotland secured a win over Wales in their third game, Scotland's first since 2007. In the eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup tie against England at Twickenham,[103] however, Scotland were thrashed 61-21.[104] This was a record defeat against the English, and a result which ended their hopes of winning the Six Nations.[104] In the last week, Scotland defeated Italy at Murrayfield with a 29-0 victory, securing fourth place in the tournament table.[105]\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc176124: Scotland national rugby union team. In the first match of the 2006 Six Nations campaign, against France, Scotland won 20\u201316,[55] and this was the first time since 1999 that they had beaten France.[56] Scotland also beat England 18\u201312 at home at Murrayfield to reclaim the Calcutta Cup.[57] In the 2006 Autumn internationals Scotland won two of three fixtures. They convincingly beat Romania[58] and put up a solid first half performance against the Pacific Islanders.[59] In the final match against Australia, Scotland failed to impress, with Australia winning 44\u201315.[60]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc176129: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland had a poor showing in the 2011 Six Nations, winning just one match, a 21\u20138 victory over Italy.[76] In the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Scotland struggled to beat Romania 34\u201324 and Georgia 15\u20136,[77][78] before losing 13\u201312 to Argentina.[79] Needing a win going into their final match against England in Auckland, they led 12\u20133 with a quarter of the game to go, only to lose out to a Chris Ashton try, going down 16\u201312. This was the first time Scotland had been knocked out in the group stages of the Rugby World Cup.[80]\n\ndoc1616474: United Kingdom national football team. England have been the only Home Nation to have any major success internationally, winning the 1966 World Cup. Scotland have qualified for the final tournaments of eight World Cups and two European Championships, but have never progressed beyond the group stage of any international tournament.  Northern Ireland have not qualified for a World Cup finals tournament since 1986, and Wales since 1958.\n\ndoc176096: Scotland national rugby union team. The Scottish rugby team dates back to 1871, where they beat England in the first international rugby union match at Raeburn Place. Scotland competed in the Five Nations from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright\u2014including the last ever Five Nations in 1999\u2014and sharing it another 8. In 2000 the competition accepted a sixth competitor, Italy, thus forming the Six Nations. Since this change, Scotland have yet to win the competition. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all eight competitions, the most recent being in 2015 where they were knocked out by Australia at the quarter-final stage in controversial circumstances. Their best finish came in 1991, where they lost to the All Blacks in the third place play-off.\n\ndoc8262: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8267: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. After taking a single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress.[6] Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever;[19] Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net.[19][24] The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, however, as Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.[6] This performance against strong opponents only heightened the frustration at the poor results earlier in the competition.[10] MacLeod initially retained his position, but resigned later that year.[10]\n\ndoc176117: Scotland national rugby union team. The second World Cup took place in 1991 with matches shared between the Five Nations. Scotland won their pool, though the game against Ireland was close, and then beat Western Samoa in the quarter-final. They lost to England in the semi-final held at Murrayfield to a Rob Andrew drop goal. In the third place play-off they were beaten by New Zealand.[38]\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc8265: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland appointed Ally MacLeod as manager in 1977. Scotland qualified for the 1978 FIFA World Cup with victories over Czechoslovakia and Wales.[18] During the build-up to the tournament, MacLeod fuelled the hopes of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home from Argentina with a medal.[19] As the squad left for the finals, they were given an enthusiastic send off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park.[20] Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America.[19] This enthusiasm was not just generated internally, as respected coaches such as Rinus Michels and Miljan Miljani\u0107 rated Scotland amongst the favourites to win the competition.[10][21] The Royal Mail commissioned designs of commemorative stamps that would have been circulated if Scotland had won the World Cup.[22]\n\ndoc2265541: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup,[1] commonly known as the Scottish Cup,[2][3] is an annual association football knock-out cup competition for men's football clubs in Scotland.[1] The competition was first held in 1873\u201374. Entry is open to all clubs with full or associate membership of the Scottish Football Association (SFA).[4] The competition is called the William Hill Scottish Cup for sponsorship reasons.[5][6]\n\ndoc176128: Scotland national rugby union team. In the 2010 Six Nations Scotland lost against France, Wales and Italy before drawing with England. Against Ireland, in the final rugby match at Croke Park, Scotland gained their only win of the tournament 23\u201320 with a last-minute penalty by Dan Parks, denying the Irish the Triple Crown and assuring they themselves would avoid the wooden spoon.[73] That summer, Scotland toured Argentina and recorded their first ever away series victory, beating the Pumas in both tests, 24\u201316 and 13\u20139.[74] In the Autumn Internationals of 2010, Scotland lost heavily against New Zealand before recording victories against South Africa, 21\u201317, and Samoa, 19\u201316.[75]\n\ndoc2457740: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. England and Scotland have played each other more than any other nation, playing 113 official matches.[56][57] England have the better record overall in the fixture, with 48 wins to Scotland's 41.[58] There have been 24 draws, only three of them goalless, with 98 years separating the first and second of those matches.[58] England have scored 195 goals to 171 by Scotland.[58] The record margin of victory in the fixture was England's 9\u20133 win in 1961,[58] while Scotland's biggest victory was 7\u20132 in 1878.[58] The record attendance of 149,415, which is also a European record attendance, was set at Hampden Park in 1937.[19]\n\ndoc176119: Scotland national rugby union team. The third World Cup, held in South Africa, came in 1995. Pool play saw a narrow defeat by France, thanks to an injury-time try, and Scotland finished second in the pool. They were eliminated in the quarter-final against New Zealand.[41]\n\ndoc506799: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. After Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Andy Roxburgh was replaced by Craig Brown as Scotland manager.[3] Brown successfully guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament, in second place behind Russia.[3] The first game at the tournament against the Netherlands ended 0\u20130, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against rivals England at Wembley Stadium.[3] Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2\u20130 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1\u20130 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4\u20130 lead in the other match briefly put both teams in a position to qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were eliminated on goals scored.[3] The Netherlands and Scotland both had four points and a goal difference of minus one.[4]\n\ndoc176115: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland went to the first World Cup, played in New Zealand and Australia in the summer of 1987. John Rutherford, the team's general and controlling influence, had injured his knee on an unauthorised tour of Bermuda. He broke down after less than a quarter of an hour of the first World Cup match against France and never played for Scotland again. Scotland had been in the lead but the match finished level. Scotland lost to New Zealand in the quarter-final. On 27 June 1988, Ian McGeechan was appointed as head coach to succeed Derrick Grant who had retired after the end of the 1988 Five Nations series.[34]\n\ndoc2265547: Scottish Cup. Clubs that are not members of the SFA may still qualify for the tournament by winning the Highland League, Lowland League, East or South of Scotland football leagues. Clubs that are members of the Scottish Junior Football Association (SJFA) have been able to qualify since 2007 by winning one of the three regional Super League divisions or by winning the Scottish Junior Cup.[10] Three junior clubs, Banks O' Dee, Girvan and Linlithgow Rose are also SFA members and therefore qualify automatically. From 2015, the winners of the Scottish Amateur Cup are also eligible to qualify.[11]\n\ndoc176120: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland won the last-ever Five Nations Championship in 1999 with a last minute win by Wales over England.[42] However, in the 1999 World Cup they suffered a quarter-final defeat to New Zealand.[43]\n\ndoc2265551: Scottish Cup. As Scotland is a member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the winner of the Scottish Cup qualifies to compete in European-wide competitions organised by UEFA. Between 1960 and 1998, the Scottish Cup winners qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup along with winners of other domestic cup competitions across Europe before it was abolished.[17] The Scottish Cup winners now qualify to compete in the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly known as the UEFA Cup).[18] It is possible for the Scottish Cup winners to have already qualified for a UEFA competition through their league ranking in the Scottish Premiership. In this scenario the qualification spot passes to the highest ranked team in that competition not yet qualified, rather than to the Scottish Cup runners-up.[19][20] Until 2014, the Scottish Cup runners-up qualified for European competition if the cup winners had also qualified for the Champions League.[20]\n\ndoc176121: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland endured a torrid Six Nations in 2000, losing their first four straight games.[44] but won the final game against England 19\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13 under captain Andy Nicol.[45]\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc983191: List of Scottish Cup finals. The Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the Scottish Cup, is a knockout cup competition in Scottish football. Organised by the Scottish Football Association, it is the third oldest existing football competition in the world, having commenced in the 1873\u201374 season just two years after the first FA Cup. The winners are awarded the world's oldest trophy, minted in 1885.[1]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc2265552: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Football Association was founded in 1873 and the Scottish Cup was created as an annual competition for its members.[21] The first Scottish Cup match took place on 18 October 1873 when Renton defeated Kilmarnock FC 2\u20130 in the first round.[22] In its early years the competition was dominated by Queen's Park who won the final 10 times in the first twenty years.[23] Vale of Leven, Dumbarton and Renton were also successful during this period.[4] In 1885, the record margin of victory in the tournament was recorded when Arbroath defeated Bon Accord 36\u20130 in a first round match.[4][23]\n\ndoc176097: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland have a strong rivalry with the English national team. They both annually compete for the Calcutta Cup. Each year, this fixture is played out as part of the Six Nations, with Scotland having last won in 2018.\n\ndoc8266: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland's first game was against Peru in C\u00f3rdoba. Two spectacular goals by Te\u00f3filo Cubillas meant that the result was a 3\u20131 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1\u20131 draw against Iran.[19] The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.[23] MacLeod had made strange selection choices, picking inexperienced full-backs and retaining the out-of-form Bruce Rioch and Don Masson.[10]\n\ndoc312850: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won.

Scotland opened their 2008 Six Nations campaign losing 27\u20136 to France at home.[63] Pressure on Frank Hadden started to intensify after Scotland lost to Wales[64] and then to Ireland.[65] They then defeated England in the Calcutta Cup with a 15\u20139 victory[66] before succumbing to Italy, avoiding the wooden spoon only on scoring difference.[67] They then toured Argentina in the summer to play two tests against Argentina. They lost the first test 21\u201315, but won the second 26\u201314.[68]\n\ndoc983194: List of Scottish Cup finals. In 1909 the cup was withheld by the SFA after a riot broke out following a replay between Rangers and Celtic. The first match was drawn 2\u20132 and the second 1\u20131.[7]\n\ndoc176112: Scotland national rugby union team. Jim Telfer became national coach in 1980,[23] inheriting a squad of genuine potential.[22] In March 1982 Scotland won away in Wales for the first time in 20 years.[24] Scotland toured Australia in July 1982 and won the first test, Scotland's first away victory against any of the big three Southern Hemisphere sides.[25][26] After this, the 1983 season was a disappointment; losing their first three Five Nations matches.[27] However, the tournament ended on a high when Scotland recorded only their second victory over England at Twickenham since 1938.[23] Scotland then went on to draw with the All Blacks 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 in the late autumn.[27]\n\ndoc1051360: Scotland. Scotland contested the first ever international football game in 1872 against England.[348] The match took place at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow, home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club. Scottish clubs have been successful in European competitions with Celtic winning the European Cup in 1967, Rangers and Aberdeen winning the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and 1983 respectively, and Aberdeen also winning the UEFA Super Cup in 1983.\n\ndoc2431703: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup.

Scotland eventually went out of the championship on goal difference, but would have proceeded beyond the first round of a tournament for the first time in their history had England not conceded a late goal in their 4\u20131 defeat of the Netherlands in their next game.[37] The Guardian newspaper later commented that \"England fans' joy was complete when Patrick Kluivert stole a late goal for the Dutch \u2013 and thereby deprived Scotland of a place in the quarter-finals\".[38]\n\ndoc1051359: Scotland. Scotland hosts its own national sporting competitions and has independent representation at several international sporting events, including the FIFA World Cup, the Rugby Union World Cup, the Rugby League World Cup, the Cricket World Cup, the Netball World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. Scotland has its own national governing bodies, such as the Scottish Football Association (the second oldest national football association in the world)[345] and the Scottish Rugby Union. Variations of football have been played in Scotland for centuries, with the earliest reference dating back to 1424.[346] Association football is the most popular sport and the Scottish Cup is the world's oldest national trophy.[347]\n\ndoc2265556: Scottish Cup. Some clubs have become renowned for eliminating higher ranked clubs from the tournament despite being underdogs. Division Two club East Fife won the tournament in 1938 by defeating Division One club Kilmarnock, the first team from outside the top-tier of league football to win the trophy. East Fife had previously reached the final in 1927 after eliminating three higher ranked clubs in the preceding rounds.[33] Hibernian became the second second-tier side to win the cup as they defeated Rangers, another second-tier side, in the 2016 final. Only one other club from outside the top-tier of league football has won the competition; non-league Queen's Park defeated Celtic in the 1893 final.[note 2] Several other clubs have reached the final whilst competing outside the top-tier of league football, but were defeated in the final. These include Dumbarton, Kilmarnock, Airdrieonians, Falkirk (twice), Gretna, Queen of the South and Ross County.\n\ndoc2457722: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. According to The Scotsman newspaper of 2 December 1872, there were only about ten football clubs in Scotland. These early international matches helped to increase the popularity of association football in Scotland.[18] The first official match was held on 30 November 1872, on Scotland's national saint's day, St. Andrew's Day, and it took place at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club.[19][20] The Scotland team was made up entirely of players from Queen's Park,[19] the most successful Scottish club of the period.[20] The game ended a 0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 draw, watched by a crowd of 4000 who had paid a shilling each for admission.[19][20]\n\ndoc176133: Scotland national rugby union team. The 2015 Six Nations Championship ended in a whitewash for Scotland, despite optimism amongst players and supporters beforehand.[93] However, Scotland displayed improved performances in their World Cup warm-up games over the summer, with two wins over Italy and narrow defeats away in Ireland and France.[94] Scotland played well at the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England; qualifying from their group by beating Japan, USA and Samoa, although they lost to South Africa. Scotland played Australia in the quarter-finals, and with 30 seconds remaining led 34\u00e2\u20ac\u201c32. However, referee Craig Joubert then awarded the Wallabies a highly controversial penalty, later judged by the game's ruling body to be incorrect, which Bernard Foley scored to give Australia victory.[95][96]\n\ndoc2431695: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. 15 clubs were involved in the draw, of which nine received a bye to the second preliminary round, while the other six entered the first preliminary round. The teams competing in these rounds were made up of teams from the East of Scotland Football League (5), South of Scotland Football League (3), North Caledonian Football League (1), Scottish Junior Football Association (4) and the Scottish Amateur Football Association (2). Glenafton Athletic took part in the Scottish Cup for the first time after winning the 2016\u201317 West of Scotland Super League Premier Division and the 2016\u201317 Scottish Junior Cup.\n\ndoc176105: Scotland national rugby union team. Internationals resumed in the 1946\u201347 season, although these were not formally recognised and no caps were awarded to participating players.[6] In January 1946, Scotland played and defeated a strong New Zealand Armed Forces team by 11\u20136.[9][10] Scotland resumed full international matches in February 1947, losing 22\u20138 to Wales at Murrayfield.[6]\n\ndoc2230756: Aberdeen F.C.. Halliday's place in the Aberdeen Hall of Fame was secured after the war when he became the first manager to bring national trophies to Pittodrie. Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup in the 1945\u201346 season, defeating Rangers 3\u20132 at Hampden.[16] They then reached the 1947 Scottish Cup final, defeating Hibernian 2\u20131 with George Hamilton, signed from Halliday's former club Queen of the South, scoring to gain the club's first major trophy.[14][18] From this early success, Halliday's side reached two more Scottish Cup finals, in 1953 and 1954, though they lost both.[14] Halliday's team were not to be denied, however, and the following season, 1954\u201355, Aberdeen won their first Scottish League title.[14][18] Though league winners, the club did not participate in the first European Cup competition\u2014Scotland's place was awarded to Hibernian, who took part by special invitation.[19]\n\ndoc2431691: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. The 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 Scottish Cup was the 133rd season of Scotland's most prestigious football knockout competition. The tournament was sponsored by bookmaker William Hill in what is the seventh season of a nine-year partnership, after contract negotiations saw the initial five-year contract extended for an additional four years in October 2015.[2]\n\ndoc176103: Scotland national rugby union team. In 1926, Scotland became the first Home nation side to defeat England at Twickenham after England had won the Grand Slam five times in eight seasons.[5][8]\n\ndoc1692965: Rangers F.C. in European football.

Scotland were defeated 3\u20132 at Craven Cottage on 22 March 1976.[13][14]\n\ndoc312848: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. European competition started in 1955 with the European Cup and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which was succeeded by the UEFA Cup for the 1971\u201372 season. The Cup Winners' Cup followed in 1960 but was discontinued in 1999. Three Scottish teams have lifted at least one European trophy. Celtic won the European Cup in 1967, Rangers won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and Aberdeen won the Cup Winners' Cup and Super Cup in 1983. Intercontinental competition started in 1960 with the Intercontinental Cup, which consisted of a two-legged tie between the European Cup and the South American Copa Libertadores winners from 1960 to 1979. To date, Celtic are the only Scottish club to participate in an intercontinental competition, losing the 1967 Intercontinental Cup to Racing Club.[1]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc2391832: Scottish Premier League. In 2003, Celtic became the first Scottish club since Dundee United in 1987 to reach a European final, eventually losing 3\u20132 to Porto after extra time in the UEFA Cup final.[23] In 2003\u201304, two Scottish clubs, Celtic and Rangers, qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time. In 2005\u201306, Rangers became the first Scottish club to reach the knockout stage of the Champions League,[24] a feat repeated by Celtic the following two seasons.[25][26] In the 2007\u201308 season, three Scottish clubs were competing in Europe after Christmas for the first time since 1970,[27] while in the same season, Rangers reached the 2008 UEFA Cup final, but lost 2\u20130 to Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg.[28] During the season, Scotland's European representatives collected the most coefficient points since the 1982\u201383 season.[20]\n\ndoc2431692: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup.

Scotland went through 1994 without a single win,[39] but bounced back in 1995 to win their first three Five Nations matches.[40] This run of wins included a 23\u201321 win away against France, courtesy of a last minute try and conversion by Gavin Hastings.[39] This was Scotland's first win in Paris since 1969.[39][40] The last Five Nations match was another Grand Slam decider against England, however this time the English defeated the Scots 24\u201312, largely due to the kicking prowess of Rob Andrew.[40]\n\ndoc983192: List of Scottish Cup finals. Celtic hold the record for most wins with 37, and the most final appearances with 56. Celtic are also the current holders, having beaten Aberdeen 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 in the 2017 final.\n\ndoc176144: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland competes annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: France, England, Ireland, Italy and Wales.[5] The Six Nations started out as the Home Nations Championship in 1883, with Scotland sharing the championship with England in 1886 before winning the title outright for the first time a year later.[5] Scotland have won the title outright 15 times and shared the championship a further nine times. Scotland have won three Grand Slams (including the Triple Crown) in 1925, 1984 and 1990, in addition to a further seven Triple Crowns.[5] They also contest the Calcutta Cup with England as part of the championship.[5] Scotland were the winners of the last Five Nations in 1999, before Italy joined the competition to make it the Six Nations.[5]\n\ndoc2457741: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. Scotland long held an advantage in terms of wins, as they recorded ten wins in the first 16 matches. Scotland, the smaller country in terms of population, were superior during this period because passing football developed earlier there, as shown by the Scotch Professors who moved to play in the nascent English professional league during the late 1880s.[59] Scotland were also dominant in the 1920s and 30s and prior to the Second World War had 29 wins in the series to England's 19. England reversed the dominance after the war, as Scotland have only won 12 matches since then. The Scots did win three games out of four from 1974 to 1977, but lost every other game in the 1970s, and have only won three times (compared to 13 English wins) since 1977. England pulled ahead for the first time in the history of the fixture with their win in 1983.\n\ndoc2265554: Scottish Cup. A total of 34 clubs have appeared in the final, of whom 25 have won the competition.[29] The most successful club in terms of wins and appearances in the final is Celtic, with 37 wins from 56.[30] Celtic and Rangers have finished runners-up on more occasions than any other club with 18 defeats each in the final.[30] The most recent winner is Celtic, who defeated Aberdeen 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 in the 2017 final.[30]\n\ndoc312847: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. Competitive football started in Scotland with the Scottish Cup, the second oldest football competition in the world, which was first held in the 1873\u201374 season. League football followed when the Scottish Football League was founded in 1890, with Dumbarton and Rangers sharing the first title. The Scottish Football League remained the highest division of the Scottish football league system until 1998, when the Scottish Premier League was founded. The Scottish Football League also added a second major cup competition in 1946, when it founded the League Cup, invititation to which is restricted to the 42 members of the league. Rangers have won a record number of league championships and League Cups, while Celtic have won a record number of Scottish Cups.\n\ndoc2265543: Scottish Cup.

Scotland were terrible during the 2012 Six Nations, picking up the wooden spoon and being whitewashed, despite promising moments,[81] and falling to 12th, Scotland's lowest ever in the IRB rankings.[82] Even after this whitewash, Scotland defeated Australia 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 in the 2012 Scotland rugby union tour of Australia, Fiji and Samoa. This was Scotland's first win in Australia since 1982 and the first time in 30 years that Scotland defeated Australia more than once in a row.[83] Scotland also recorded away wins over both Fiji and Samoa.[84] During Scotland's 2012 Autumn Tests they suffered a series of defeats, versus the All Blacks, South Africa and most notably Tonga, which caused head coach Andy Robinson to resign.[85] Scott Johnson became interim Head Coach for the team in December 2012.[86]\n\ndoc897513: 2015 Cricket World Cup. Scotland defeated the United Arab Emirates in the final of the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier and both teams qualified for the last two spots in the 2015 Cricket World Cup.[26]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\ndoc2457725: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The only exception to this pattern of annual fixtures in the spring was in 1973, when there were two games. The first game that year was a friendly match that marked the centenary of the Scottish Football Association. There were also two fixtures staged in 1902, but this was because the first game had to be abandoned due to the first Ibrox disaster. The British Home Championship also acted as qualifiers for three major tournaments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 1950 World Cup, the 1954 World Cup and the 1968 European Championship.\n\ndoc2265546: Scottish Cup. Any club that is a full or associate member of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) is entitled to compete in the tournament and qualifies automatically.[1] Every team that plays in the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is therefore eligible. Between 1895 and 2007, clubs that were SFA members but not competitors in the country's professional football leagues could only qualify for the tournament by winning the Scottish Qualifying Cup.[10]\n\ndoc312849: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. Domestic League\nLeague = Scottish league champions (since 1890)\n\ndoc176095: Scotland national rugby union team. The Scotland national rugby union team is administered by the Scottish Rugby Union. The team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and participates in the Rugby World Cup, which takes place every four years. As of 26\u00a0February\u00a02018[update], Scotland are 5th in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\ndoc176114: Scotland national rugby union team. In January 1986, a trial match between \"Blues\" (players expected to feature for Scotland) and \"Reds\" (emerging players with a possible international future) resulted in a shock 41\u201310 win for the \"Reds\".[30] The \"Reds\" team included Gavin and Scott Hastings, Finlay Calder and David Sole, all of whom who would debut for Scotland in the Five Nations that year and feature prominently for side in the years that followed.[31] Scotland went on to share the 1986 Five Nations championship with France, each side winning three out of their four games.[32] The series also saw Scotland thrash England 33\u20136 at Murrayfield; Scotland's record win over the English, at the time one point short of Scotland's best score in any rugby union international and England's heaviest defeat in over a century.[33]\n\ndoc180689: Scottish independence referendum, 2014. Former Labour first minister Henry McLeish published a report in May 2014 that found no obvious barriers to an independent Scotland competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[285] McLeish said that some athletes, particularly those in team sports, may choose to compete for the existing Great Britain team rather than Scotland, as they would be nationals of both states.[285] International Olympic Committee representative Craig Reedie pointed out that Scotland would need to obtain United Nations membership and may want to set its own Olympic qualifying standards, which would need to be done in the period between independence (March 2016) and the closing date for entries (July 2016).[285][286]\n\ndoc2431699: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. The first round took place on the weekend of 23 September 2017. Along with the six winners from the second preliminary round, there were 30 new entries at this stage, 14 from the Lowland Football League and 16 from the Highland Football League.[6]\n\ndoc983196: List of Scottish Cup finals. A draw in the final used to result in the match being replayed at a later date. Since the 1981 final, however, the result has always been decided on the day, with a penalty shootout if required after extra time.\n\ndoc2457743: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. Rangers defeated Leeds United home and away to qualify for the first Champions League group stage in 1992\u201393. Celtic lost on the away goals rule to Liverpool in the 1997\u201398 UEFA Cup, but they beat Blackburn Rovers and Liverpool on their run to the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.[65] Celtic and Manchester United were drawn together twice in the Champions League group phase in quick succession, in 2006\u201307 and 2008\u201309,[65] while Arsenal beat Celtic 5\u20131 on aggregate in the 2009\u201310 qualifiers.\n\ndoc2457724: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. From the first match in late 1872, England and Scotland played each other in the spring of every year (except during World War I and World War II) until 1989. From 1884 until 1984, the match was the highlight of the annual British Home Championship played between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[note 1] After the British Home Championship ended in 1984, the annual England v Scotland fixture continued in the form of the Rous Cup until 1989.\n\ndoc1072912: 1998 FIFA World Cup. Scotland managed only one point, coming in a 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 draw against Norway, and failed to get out of the first round for an eighth time in the FIFA World Cup, a record that stands to this date.\n\ndoc1057503: 1938 Scottish Cup Final. The 1938 Scottish Cup Final was played on 23 April 1938 at Hampden Park in Glasgow and was the final of the 60th Scottish Cup. East Fife and Kilmarnock contested the match. Following a 1\u20131 draw the match was replayed on 27 April 1938, at the end of normal time the score was 2\u20132. East Fife then went on to win the match 4\u20132 to win their only Scottish Cup, helmed by their manager David McLean.\n\ndoc1815072: 2018\u201319 Scottish League Cup. The competition began with eight groups of five teams. The four clubs competing in the UEFA Champions League (Celtic) and Europa League (Aberdeen, Hibernian and Rangers) qualifying rounds were given a bye through to the second round. The 40 teams competing in the group stage consisted of the other eight teams that competed in the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership, and all of the teams that competed in the 2017\u201318 Scottish Championship, 2017\u201318 Scottish League One and 2017\u201318 Scottish League Two, as well as the 2017\u201318 Highland Football League and the 2017\u201318 Lowland Football League champions.\n\ndoc2457723: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The first goal between the two sides was scored by England's William Kenyon-Slaney[21] in the next game at The Oval, the first official match between the two in England, which the English won 4\u20132 on 8 March 1873.[18] Following this, the game became an annual event, being held in England or Scotland in alternate years.[18] Scotland took their first win in the fixture in the 1874 game, again played at Hamilton Crescent, where they defeated England 2\u20131.[22] Later in the 1870s Scotland won the fixture three times in a row, including a 7\u20132 victory in the 1878 game.[18]\n\ndoc312846: List of football clubs in Scotland by major honours won. This is a list of the major honours won by football clubs in Scotland. It lists every Scottish football club to have won any of the three major domestic trophies, six major European competitions which have existed at different times, or the two global competitions FIFA has recognised. These honours consist of the Scottish football championship\u2014the Scottish Football League up to 1998, Scottish Premier League from 1998 to 2013 and the Scottish Professional Football League thereafter\u2014the Scottish Cup, the League Cup, the Champions League or its predecessor the European Cup, the now-defunct European Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Europa League or its predecessors the UEFA Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup or its predecessor the Intercontinental Cup.\n\ndoc425633: Old Firm. Hampden, Scotland's national stadium and home of Queen's Park, is situated roughly an equal distance from Ibrox and Celtic Park in Glasgow. Due to the frequency of the two teams appearing in semi-finals and finals held there (often facing one another), its West and East stands are always allocated to the same club and are informally known as the Rangers end and Celtic end respectively.[145][146] That stadium, once the largest in the world,[144][140] attracted the largest Old Firm attendance of all time with 132,870 at the 1969 Scottish Cup Final[140] (it is not the record for the competition, with 147,365 having attended the 1937 final which also featured Celtic, versus Aberdeen).[140][144] The record Scottish League Cup final attendance (107,609; October 1965) was an Old Firm affair,[140] although the tournament record was set in 1947 when Rangers overcame Hibernian in a semi-final before 123,830.[147]\n\ndoc176116: Scotland national rugby union team. Their greatest year in the modern era was 1990,[citation needed] when their season came down to one game, a Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield against the \"auld enemy\", England. Both sides had won all their Five Nations fixtures, and England were overwhelming favourites despite being the away side. Scotland under the captaincy of prop David Sole went on to win 13\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7,[35] and with it their third Grand Slam.[36] The match against England in 1990 was also only the second time that Flower of Scotland was played at Murrayfield, having become Scotland's pre-match national anthem that year.[37]\n\ndoc176137: Scotland national rugby union team. Victory over Samoa in November 2017[106] was followed by a breathtaking performance against New Zealand at a sold-out Murrayfield. Tries from Jonny Gray and Huw Jones brought Scotland to 17-22 with barely a minute to go, but it took a superb cover tackle from the All Blacks fly-half Beaudan Barrett to prevent Stuart Hogg from scoring a winning try.[107] A week later Scotland registered a record win over the Wallabies, inflicting eight tries on the visitors in what was the Australian hooker Stephen Moore's final international game. Scotland won 53-24, their biggest ever margin of victory over Australia.[108]\n\ndoc590924: Perfect season. Celtic went domestically unbeaten across the 2016\u201317 season over all 38 league games in Scotland, finishing 30 points clear of second-place Aberdeen with 34 wins and 4 draws. Celtic also won the 2016\u201317 Scottish League Cup and the 2016\u201317 Scottish Cup, giving them the accolade of being the only club to win a domestic treble unbeaten.[48][49]\n\ndoc2457728: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The match played in 1967 is Scotland's most famous victory against England.[19] England had won the 1966 FIFA World Cup at Wembley less than a year previously and were undefeated in 19 games.[19][25] Despite fielding four of the Celtic side that would go on to win the European Cup a month later and stars such as Denis Law, Jim Baxter and Billy Bremner, Scotland were massive underdogs going into the match.[19] Scotland took an early lead through a goal by Law, and Bobby Lennox put Scotland 2\u20130 up with just 12 minutes remaining.[19] England were somewhat hampered by the fact that Jack Charlton suffered an injury early in the game.[19][25] England manager Alf Ramsey was unable to substitute Charlton and therefore decided to use him in the unfamiliar role of centre forward.[19][25] Ironically, Charlton scored England's first goal.[19] Scotland soon reestablished a two-goal lead, however, with Jim McCalliog making the score 3\u20131.[19] Geoff Hurst scored a late goal to make the final score 3\u20132 to Scotland.[19]\n\ndoc2431697: 2017\u201318 Scottish Cup. Clubs with a valid Club License at the date of the draw are eligible for a bye to the second preliminary round.[6] Teams in Bold advanced to the first round.\n\ndoc2265559: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Health Education Group was the first organisation to sponsor the Scottish Cup in 1983 with the largest sponsorship package in Scottish football at the time, worth around \u00a3200,000.[47] The partnership was praised for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle linked with football.[41] The deal ended in 1989 when Tennent Caledonian Breweries won the sponsorship rights. Tennent's association with the tournament raised the debate about alcohol sponsorship within sports following the riots at the 1980 Scottish Cup Final which resulted in the sale of alcohol being banned at Scottish sporting events.[41] Despite this controversy, the partnership was largely successful and lasted 18 years until 2007. The SFA received around \u00a325 million over the duration of the sponsorship deal.[40] The Scottish Government in association with businessman Willie Haughey sponsored the Scottish Cup between 2008 and 2010. The 2008\u201309 competition was known as the Homecoming Scottish Cup to promote Scotland's year of homecoming and tourism.[43] The 2009\u201310 competition was known the Active Nation Scottish Cup to promote a healthy living through football.[44] Carling was an additional sponsor between 2010 and 2014 as the competition's official beer.[48] The current title sponsor is bookmaker William Hill.[45]\n\ndoc2457737: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. In the early 21st century there have again been suggestions that the British Home Championship should be restored to the schedule, or at least for the England v Scotland fixture to be played more regularly.[44][45] There was some speculation that England would invite Scotland to be their first opponents when Wembley Stadium was re-opened in 2007,[46] but this did not happen. There was further talk of organising a one-off England v Scotland match at the end of the 2007\u201308 season,[47] but the Scotland manager George Burley was opposed to this timing and the match was not arranged.[48] On 16 June 2012, The Football Association announced that England would play Scotland in August 2013 as part of their 150th anniversary celebrations.[49] England won an entertaining friendly fixture by 3\u20132, after Scotland had twice taken the lead.[50]\n\ndoc1815077: 2018\u201319 Scottish League Cup. Aberdeen, Celtic, Hibernian and Rangers entered the competition at this stage, after receiving a bye for the group stage due to their participation in UEFA club competitions.\n\ndoc2457717: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. The BBC website has commented that the games \"have represented all that is good and all that is bad about football since the fixture began,\"[6] while The Guardian newspaper once reported that \"for millions across both sides of the border the encounter represents a chance for the ultimate victory over the enemy.\"[7] As of June 2017, the teams have played 114 matches; England have won 48, Scotland 41, and there have been 25 draws.[8]\n\n"
