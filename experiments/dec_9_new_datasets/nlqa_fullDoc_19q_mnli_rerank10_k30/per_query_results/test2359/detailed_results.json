Doreen Mantle (born 1926) is a South African-born[1] English actress who is probably best known for her role as Jean Warboys in One Foot in the Grave (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000).[2]\n\ndoc486894: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mrs Warboys.\n\ndoc574636: One Foot in the Grave. Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Victor and Margaret Meldrew. Victor appears to be alive but Margaret does not acknowledge him, implying that he is actually a ghost after she complains about a cold air in the room.\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc486890: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Last episode directed by Susan Belbin, who had to step down during filming due to ill health, and subsequently left the BBC. Gareth Gwenlan directed the remainder of the episode without credit, and Christine Gernon took over as the series' director the following year.\n\ndoc486892: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Writer David Renwick makes a cameo appearance on Victor's TV, alongside presenter Lorraine Kelly, as a gentleman being interviewed for a feature on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\ndoc574624: One Foot in the Grave. One Foot in the Grave is a British black sitcom[1] written by David Renwick. There were six series and seven Christmas specials over an eleven-year period, from early 1990 to late 2000. The first five series were broadcast between January 1990 and January 1995. For the next five years, the show appeared only as Christmas specials, followed by one final series in 2000.\n\ndoc574647: One Foot in the Grave. Cousin Wilfred (John Rutland) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs. Warboys' cousin, Wilfred, appeared twice in the series, and was considered to be a fairly boring middle-aged man. In the final series the character returned, but the effects of a stroke rendered him mute, and forced him to \"speak\" with the aid of an electronic voice generator. His poor typing on the generator led to several misunderstandings, such as asking Victor for a \"bra of soup\" (as opposed to a \"bar of soap\") and describing a visit to his \"brothel\" (as opposed to \"brother\").\n\ndoc574660: One Foot in the Grave. The series also won the Best Television Sitcom in 1992 from the Royal Television Society and the British Comedy Award for Best Sitcom in 1992, 1995 and 2001.[22]\n\ndoc486876: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. This is a list of episodes of the British sitcom One Foot in the Grave, written by David Renwick. The show ran for six series of six episodes each. There were also nine specials including two shorts for Comic Relief, first screened from 4 January 1990 to 20 November 2000 on BBC One and subsequently repeated both on the BBC and thereafter on satellite channels such as Gold.[1] Some of the early episodes bear a 1989 copyright date. While the programme has always been shown after the 9pm watershed on the BBC, other channels have sometimes shown it in earlier slots, with minor cuts.\n\ndoc1531796: Things Aren't Simple Any More. The five previous series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health.[18] Renwick persuaded her to return to work on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again.[3] The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.[18]\n\ndoc363782: Angus Deayton. He also played Victor Meldrew's long-suffering neighbour Patrick Trench in the comedy series One Foot in the Grave, and George Windsor in the final three series of Waterloo Road.\n\ndoc366238: Enn Reitel. He also played two roles in different episodes of long-running sitcom One Foot in the Grave. In the first Christmas special, he played \"Mr. Starkey\", a down and out who holds Victor Meldrew and his neighbour's father at gunpoint to wait for Armageddon on Christmas Day. In the second episode of series 3, \"Dreamland\", he played a tramp who took a fancy to Victor's shoes, but drew the line at his Noel Edmonds-esque sweater.\n\ndoc486884: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc574638: One Foot in the Grave. Despite being friends, she has driven Margaret to distraction on several occasions. Most notably in \"Only a Story\", when she stayed with the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret to the point of distraction with her complaining and laziness. Jean was also shown as a somewhat absent-minded character, as she has a pet cockatiel despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while having a conversation with someone else. Doreen Mantle described her character as \"wanting to do the right thing but always finding out that it was the wrong thing\".[12]\n\ndoc574626: One Foot in the Grave. The series was occasionally the subject of controversy for some of its darker story elements, but nevertheless received a number of awards, including the 1992 BAFTA for Best Comedy. The programme came 80th in the British Film Institute's 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.[4] The series, originally shown on BBC One, is now available on DVD and is regularly repeated in the United Kingdom. Four episodes were remade for BBC Radio 2[5] The series inspired a novel, published in 1992, featuring the most memorable moments from the first two series and the first Christmas special.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc1758231: Owen Brenman. Owen Brenman (born 17 December 1956 in London) is an English actor best known for his role as next-door neighbour Nick Swainey in the multi-award-winning BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave, which ran for ten years (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000) and was written by David Renwick. He currently plays Dr. Heston Carter in the BBC drama series Doctors[1]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\ndoc574652: One Foot in the Grave. The production of the show was in a conventional sitcom format, with episodes taped live in front of a studio audience, interposed with pre-filmed location material.[6]\n\ndoc486882: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Nick Swainey (and his unseen mother) become the Meldrews' next door neighbours with this episode.\n\ndoc574633: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574659: One Foot in the Grave. The programme received a number of prestigious awards. In 1992, it won a BAFTA as Best Comedy (Programme or Series). During its ten-year run, the series was nominated a further six times. Richard Wilson also won Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1992 and 1994, and Annette Crosbie was nominated for the same award in 1994.\n\ndoc486898: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. A series of remakes originally broadcast on BBC Radio 2, with Richard Wilson, Annette Crosbie, Owen Brenman and Doreen Mantle reprising their TV roles. Its original run coincided with the broadcast of TV series 5. All episodes are 30 minutes long and produced by Diane Messias. They were subsequently issued on audio cassette, CD and audio download.\n\ndoc486887: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Richard Wilson is the only actor to appear in this episode. As a result, this is the only one of the 42 episodes that Annette Crosbie does not appear.\n\ndoc486886: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: This episode was edited after broadcast due to complaints over the elderly abuse scene. The song \"Out of Town\" by Max Bygraves is featured.\n\ndoc486885: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Cousin Wilfred and Ronnie and Mildred.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc486879: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. All six series and specials were initially available on BBC Worldwide VHS video tapes. The Comic Relief Shorts from 1993 and 2001 have not been released on DVD. One Foot in the Grave Best-of was also released in Region 4, 8 July 2004.\n\ndoc574639: One Foot in the Grave. Patrick Trench (Angus Deayton) \u2013 Patrick and his wife Pippa live next door to Victor, and often catches Victor engrossed in seemingly preposterous situations, all of which in context are perfectly innocuous. The couple's relationship with their neighbours begins badly after Victor mistakes Patrick and Pippa for distant relations when they arrive outside with three suitcases\u00a0\u2013 not realising that they are his next-door neighbours, having been on a lengthy holiday from the day Victor and Margaret moved in. Victor subsequently invites the bemused pair to stay; this and later incidents cause Patrick to suspect that Victor is quite insane, possibly bordering on malicious.\n\ndoc363788: Angus Deayton. In 1990, Deayton was cast as the Meldrews' neighbour Patrick Trench in the British suburban sitcom One Foot in the Grave and was selected as host of Have I Got News for You. The same year, he featured on television advertising the Vauxhall Nova. Andre Ptaszynski tried to persuade him to take the lead role in Steven Moffat's sitcom Chalk, a role eventually taken by David Bamber.[4]\n\ndoc574643: One Foot in the Grave. New neighbours Derek and Betty McVitie replaced the Trenches for the 1997 special \"Endgame\", however this turned out to be their only appearances in the series and they were said to have emigrated by the penultimate episode which caused Nick Swainey to leap straight in with the offer for their old house. Series six saw the Trenches return as prominent characters, albeit living in a house some distance from the Meldrews. Despite appearing in five out of six series and three Christmas specials, neither of the Trenches ever share a scene with Mrs Warboys, and Pippa only ever shares one scene with Nick Swainey (in the episode \"Who Will Buy?\").\n\ndoc574649: One Foot in the Grave. Mimsy Berkovitz - Another unseen character, she is the local agony aunt, whom many of the characters turn to for advice. In the episode \"The Secret of the Seven Sorcerers\", Patrick is heard talking to her on the radio, seeking her advice on how to cope when Victor and Margaret invite him and Pippa around to dinner.\n\ndoc574656: One Foot in the Grave. Over the show's history, it featured a number of notable comic actors in one-off roles. These included Susie Blake, John Bird, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Peter Cook, Diana Coupland, Phil Daniels, Edward de Souza, Hannah Gordon, Georgina Hale, Jimmy Jewel, Rula Lenska, Stephen Lewis, Brian Murphy, Christopher Ryan, Barbara Windsor, Joan Sims and Ray Winstone. Two of Angus Deayton's former Radio Active and KYTV co-stars, Geoffrey Perkins and Michael Fenton Stevens were cast, in separate episodes, as respectively the brother and brother-in-law of Deayton's character. A few actors little-known at the time also appeared in one-off roles before going on to greater fame, including Lucy Davis, Joanna Scanlan, Eamonn Walker and Arabella Weir.\n\ndoc1531784: Things Aren't Simple Any More. \"Things Aren't Simple Any More\" is the final episode of the British television sitcom One Foot in the Grave. It was written by David Renwick and stars Richard Wilson as Victor Meldrew, Annette Crosbie as his wife Margaret, and features guest appearances by Hannah Gordon and Paul Merton. The episode depicts the death of the series' protagonist, Victor Meldrew, in a hit-and-run road accident, and his wife's efforts to deal with the driver who killed him. Renwick had been struggling to conceive and write new stories for the series and decided to kill off the character. The episode was filmed at Shawford, Hampshire, and at BBC Television Centre in London.[3]\n\ndoc574661: One Foot in the Grave. In 2004, One Foot in the Grave came tenth in a BBC poll to find \"Britain's Best Sitcom\" with 31,410 votes.[23] The programme also came 80th in the British Film Institute's 100 Greatest British Television Programmes [4]\n\ndoc486889: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mildred. The song \"No Particular Place to Go\" by Chuck Berry is featured.\n\ndoc486895: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Nick Swainey and Patrick and Pippa.\n\ndoc486893: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Ronnie and Cousin Wilfred.\n\ndoc574632: One Foot in the Grave. Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) \u2013 Victor is the main protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself constantly battling against all that life throws at him as he becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser.[11] From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after an automatic security system made him redundant at the office where he worked as a security guard, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor does not see himself as retired and is always trying to find another job, but all his attempts end in failure. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite fa\u00e7ade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. \"Victor-isms\" include \"I do not believe it!\", \"I don't believe it!\", \"Un-be-lievable!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?\", \"In the name of sanity!\". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassion\u2014in \"Hearts of Darkness\" he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in \"Descent Into The Maelstrom\" he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 42 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says \"You were always my first choice\", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode \"The Wisdom of the Witch\" in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, out of the window of the house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.\n\ndoc486888: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: This episode is considered to be the 1994 Christmas special.\n\ndoc486881: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Victor's famous catchphrase \"I don't believe it!\" is introduced in this episode.\n\ndoc486883: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Patrick and Pippa\n\ndoc574667: One Foot in the Grave. All six series and specials were initially available on BBC Worldwide VHS video tapes during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Comic Relief Shorts from 1993 and 2001 have not been released on DVD. A One Foot in the Grave Very Best Of DVD featuring five of the greatest episodes was released on 22 October 2001 in Region 2. Then on 8 July 2004, a One Foot in the Grave Very Best Of was also released in Region 4. Each series was gradually released on DVD in Region 2 between 2004 and 2006, with a complete series 1-6 box set towards the end of 2006. A slimmer series 1-6 box set was released in 2010 in Region 2.\n\ndoc574642: One Foot in the Grave. Pippa Trench (n\u00e9e Croker) (Janine Duvitski) \u2013 Patrick's wife sought friendly relations with the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men to make peace with each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home, thinking they were removal men who had initially come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a house clearance firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a \"gormless twerp\" on an answering machine message, unaware she was listening)\u00a0\u2013 for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one domino in his hand, and Victor had two pimples on his nose.\n\ndoc574666: One Foot in the Grave. Wilson dislikes saying his character's catchphrase (\"I don't believe it!\") and only performs the line for charity events for a small fee.[31] This became a joke in the actor's guest appearance as himself in the Father Ted episode \"The Mainland\", where Ted annoys him by constantly repeating his catchphrase. The situation was conceived when Father Ted writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews sat behind Wilson at a performance of Le Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall. They considered how \"tasteless and wrong\" it would be to lean forward to him every time that an acrobat did a stunt and yell the catchphrase, and then they realised that that's exactly what their fictional priests would do.[32] This was also played upon when Wilson made a guest appearance on the comedy TV quiz show Shooting Stars, in which Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer purposefully misquoted his catchphrase by referring to him as \"Richard 'I don't believe you' Wilson\".\n\ndoc574654: One Foot in the Grave. One Foot used Bournemouth to film some exterior sequences because of its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the house\u2014near Pokesdown, Bournemouth\u2014which had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed hands and the new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees that the previous owners had asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided to find a new house, and the first episode of the second series was rewritten to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire (this was filmed on waste ground in Northcote Road, Springbourne). This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.[14]\n\ndoc574651: One Foot in the Grave. Martin Trout (Peter Cook) - A paparazzo in \"One Foot in the Algarve\". He manages to take a number of compromising photographs, involving a high-ranking politician. Trout compares the potential impact of the photos to the Profumo affair. On his way to sell the images, he loses the roll of film whilst arguing at a phone box with the Meldrews and subsequently pursues them across the Algarve to retrieve it. He suffers a number of disasters both related and unrelated to Victor and Margaret's own misfortunes, only to find that the film had actually fallen into the lining of his jacket and had been with him for much of his journey. He lost it in the door of the Meldrews' car. Retrieving the roll after a brief spell in hospital, Trout attempts to leave the Algarve in a taxi but is involved in a car crash.\n\ndoc574629: One Foot in the Grave. Although set in a traditional suburban setting, the show subverts this genre with a strong overtone of black comedy. Series One's \"The Valley of Fear\" is an episode which caused controversy, when Victor finds a frozen cat in his freezer. Writer David Renwick also combined farce with elements of tragedy.[6] For example, in the final episode, Victor is killed by a hit-and-run driver, and although there is no explicit reference that Victor and Margaret had children, the episode \"Timeless Time\" contained a reference to someone named Stuart; the strong implication being that they once had a son who had died as a child.[5][7][8]\n\ndoc574644: One Foot in the Grave. Nick Swainey (Owen Brenman) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The excessively cheerful and often oblivious Mr Swainey appeared in the first episode, encouraging Victor to join his OAPs' trip to Eastbourne, and being greeted with Victor's trademark abuse. When the Meldrews move house, they discover he is their neighbour, living on the other side of the Meldrews from the Trenches. He remains continuously optimistic; even his being told to \"piss off\" by Victor is laughed off. Despite this run-in he later befriends Victor, and they frequently chat in their gardens, where Victor is often surprised by Mr Swainey's activities, ranging from archery and preparing amateur dramatics props, to bizarre games he arranges for his bedridden senile mother, whom the audience never actually see. Despite his cheery demeanour, he does occasionally drop his guard, once displaying apparent depression at being nothing more than \"an overgrown boy-scout\". Following his mother's death, he moved house near the end of the series, but only went as far as the Trenches'/McVitie's old house, claiming he'd always wanted to live in an \"end house, without leaving the area\". This took Victor by surprise; he did not learn where Mr Swainey was moving to until, while reminiscing in the garden about his departure, Mr Swainey suddenly appeared from the other side.\n\ndoc486891: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Only appearances of Derek and Betty McVitie. Features the song \"River Runs Deep\" performed by JJ Cale.\n\ndoc574665: One Foot in the Grave. Renwick integrated some of the plots and dialogue from the series into a novel, which was first published by BBC Books in 1992. Renwick also adapted four episodes for BBC Radio 2, which first aired between 21 January 1995 and 11 February 1995.[5] The episodes are \"Alive and Buried\", \"In Luton Airport, No One Can Hear You Scream\", \"Timeless Time\" and \"The Beast in the Cage\". They are regularly repeated on the digital speech station BBC Radio 4 Extra and are available on audio CD.\n\ndoc574645: One Foot in the Grave. Ronnie and Mildred (Gordon Peters and Barbara Ashcroft) \u2013 Ronnie and Mildred were a constantly cheerful, but incredibly boring, couple who provided yet another annoyance to the Meldrews, who dreaded any upcoming visits to them; Victor once said that he had hoped they were both dead. In \"The Worst Horror of All\", when the couple attempted a surprise visit, the Meldrews hid in their house to give the impression they were away on holiday, and then took the phone off the hook for several days afterwards, though these efforts to avoid them were in vain. They are referenced a number of times in the series for giving the Meldrews bizarre and always unwanted presents that are seldom opened, usually involving a garish photograph of themselves. In the final series, however it was clear that their cheerfulness was a fa\u00e7ade and, in a particularly dark scene, Mildred hanged herself \"during a game of Happy Families\". The shot of Mildred's feet dangling outside the window is usually cut from pre-watershed screenings.\n\ndoc574635: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret could be said to have a catchphrase - typically a long, exasperated use of the word \"God\", usually when making a realisation about the reasons behind one of Victor's mishaps. These are occasionally inadvertently aided by herself in some way, such as leaving the phone off the hook or giving permission to someone to enter the Meldrews' house when she isn't there.\n\ndoc486896: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: The song that's played over the ending of the episode is \"End of the Line\" by the Traveling Wilburys. In the US release of the DVD the song is replaced by stock music. The reason for this is presumably the music clearance rights were not granted for US viewers.\n\ndoc574657: One Foot in the Grave. The show was produced with an aspect ratio of 4:3 from 1990 to 1997. Three years later, the show returned to television for its final series, which was produced with an aspect ratio of 16:9. All episodes are of Standard Definition 576i.\n\ndoc574640: One Foot in the Grave. However, Patrick's rift with Victor eventually transforms him into a rather cynical character (much like Victor), and he often responds to him in similarly vindictive ways as a means of trying to settle the score. For example, writing complaints and grievances on post-it notes. This aspect of Patrick's character came to a head in the episode \"The Executioner's Song\" where his face temporarily morphs into that of Victor's as he looks into a mirror.\n\ndoc574662: One Foot in the Grave. A number of complaints were made during the series' run for its depiction of animal deaths. For example, in the episode \"The Valley of Fear\", a dead cat is found in the Meldrews' freezer; in another, a tortoise is roasted in a brazier. However, this was later cited as a positive feature of the programme's daring scripts in Britain's Best Sitcom by its advocate Rowland Rivron.[24] The programme was censured, however, for a scene in the episode \"Hearts of Darkness\" in which an elderly resident is abused in an old people's home, and following complaints, the scene was slightly cut when the episode was repeated.[25] In the DVD commentary for the episode, David Renwick stated his continued opposition to the cuts.[26] Another controversial scene in the episode \"Tales of Terror\" saw the Meldrews visit Ronnie and Mildred on the understanding that Mildred had gone upstairs during a game of Happy Families and not returned; Ronnie then shows her feet hanging outside of the window, revealing that she has committed suicide. The Broadcasting Standards Commission received complaints about this scene.[8]\n\ndoc574658: One Foot in the Grave. The One Foot in the Grave theme song was written, composed and sung by Eric Idle. A longer version was produced for the special \"One Foot in the Algarve\", released as a single with five remixes and a karaoke version in November 1994.[19] Idle included a live version of the song on his album Eric Idle Sings Monty Python.[20] It is preluded by a similar adaptation of \"Bread of Heaven\" to that used in the episode \"The Beast in the Cage\" by disgruntled car mechanics.[9][21] The title music on the TV series is accompanied at the beginning and end of each episode by footage of Galapagos tortoises. The series also made extensive use of incidental music, composed by Ed Welch, which often hinted at a particular genre to fit the mood of the scenes, frequently incorporating well-known pieces of music such as \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\" or Intermezzo from Jean Sibelius' Karelia Suite. In the Christmas special \"Endgame\" during Margaret's alleged death scene, a compilation of clips from past episodes are accompanied by the song \"River Runs Deep\" performed by J. J. Cale. The final episode ended with a montage of some of the mishaps Victor encountered, which were mentioned in the episode\u00a0\u2013 backed by \"End of the Line\" by the Traveling Wilburys.\n\ndoc1738127: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Wilson's biography, One Foot on the Stage: The Biography of Richard Wilson, was written by James Roose-Evans.[11]\n\ndoc574655: One Foot in the Grave. Since series two, the exterior scenes of the Meldrew's home were filmed at Tresillian Way, Walkford, near New Milton in Hampshire.[15] These later series make extensive use of specific street and garden locations in most episodes, particularly for scenes involving the Meldrew's neighbours.[16] Most outside locations were filmed in and around Bournemouth and Christchurch. These include Richmond Hill, Undercliff Drive and Boscombe Pier, Bournemouth Town Hall, Lansdowne College, Christchurch Hospital and the former Royal Victoria Hospital (Boscombe). Later episodes, such as \"Hearts of Darkness\", were filmed entirely on location. Victor's death by a hit and run driver in the final episode was filmed at Shawford railway station, Hampshire. Fans left floral tributes at the site.[17][18]\n\ndoc614653: Jonathan Creek. Others who were tried for the part included Nigel Planer (who would later guest star) and Angus Deayton (who had previously worked with Renwick and director Susan Belbin on One Foot in the Grave). Almost a dozen actors were considered before Susan Belbin saw Alan Davies during a rehearsal for a sitcom. Davies was invited round to talk to Renwick and \"turned up in his duffle coat with straggly hair and a broad grin [and] was self-evidently the closest match yet to Creek as we had always seen him\".[9]\n\ndoc574646: One Foot in the Grave. Alfred Meldrew (Richard Pearson) - Victor's absent-minded brother, who lives in New Zealand. During the episode \"The Broken Reflection\", he comes to visit after 25 years, to the disdain of Victor. Alfred is an eccentric character, often walking around with his hat on fire, and bringing over his and Victor's great-grandfather's skull. He is a clumsy character too, mistaking the table-cloth for a napkin and dropping the entire contents of the table all over the floor when he stands up, and breaking a mirror in the middle of the night after mistaking his own reflection for a burglar. Victor starts to warm to Alfred towards the end of his visit, but Alfred leaves early the next day after finding an unpleasant message about him that Victor had accidentally recorded on a dictaphone. He is not seen again, but keeps in touch with the Meldrews, as Victor is seen looking at some photographs Alfred had sent over in \"The Trial\".\n\ndoc1738130: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Wilson was a supporter of his local football club, Greenock Morton, but he has come to lend greater support to English club Manchester United.[14] He is a patron of the Manchester United Supporters Trust.[15] Wilson has been a campaigner for gay rights for many years,[16] and he came out as gay in a Daily Mail interview in March 2013.[17] Wilson is good friends with his One Foot in the Grave co-star Angus Deayton, and is godfather to Deayton's son.[18]\n\ndoc574648: One Foot in the Grave. Great Aunt Joyce and Uncle Dick - Unseen characters, they are often mentioned by Victor and Margaret, as an aging and grim couple and Victor and Margaret dread having anything to do with them. Great Aunt Joyce is mentioned as having a glass eye and has the habit of knitting bizarre items (such as six-fingered gloves) for Victor. Uncle Dick has a wooden arm; in the final Comic Relief (2001) episode, it transpires that a nurse had mistakenly placed a drip in the false arm for 18 hours after a trip to hospital after trying to remove a kidney stone with a wire coat hanger.\n\ndoc1382830: Barefoot in the Park (film). Barefoot in the Park is a 1967 American comedy film starring Jane Fonda as Corie, and Robert Redford as Paul.\n\ndoc1531803: Things Aren't Simple Any More. Salmon agreed not to broadcast the episode at Christmas.[3] It was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000,[2] forty minutes in length, rather than usual thirty. The episode's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don't Believe It! The One Foot In The Grave Story, a documentary presented by Angus Deayton which looked back at the hit sitcom.[23] The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release.\n\ndoc119098: Prince Hamlet. Although, the difference between a sexton and a grave digger must also be taken into account. A sexton oversees many different jobs around the church and surrounding areas. A grave digger simply digs graves. There are sextons who also dig graves and some that do not. It is completely possible that the Gravedigger has been a sexton for 30 years, but has not been digging graves for that entire time. This could be another example of the character's very round-about way of speaking.\n\ndoc2563632: List of Hotel Transylvania characters. In Good Night Mr. Foot, one Witch (voiced by Rose Abdoo) was shown bothering Bigfoot which ended with a pillow fight.\n\ndoc2089054: The Gravediggers. The Second Gravedigger exits as Hamlet and Horatio enter, and the First Gravedigger begins to sing a song on the topics of love and graves as he digs. He throws a skull (and later a second) up and out of the grave. Hamlet then talks to Horatio about how inappropriate it is to treat what used to be someone's, and possibly an important someone's, body in such a way. He decides to ask the Gravedigger whose grave he is digging, but the Gravedigger will not reveal the answer without another witty exchange.\n\ndoc1382837: Barefoot in the Park (film). The next day, Paul comes home with a fever, but Corie still insists she wants a divorce. The two spend an awkward time together in their apartment before Corie kicks Paul out. She then gets a call from her aunt, saying that Ethel did not come home. Corie panics, and eventually finds out that her mother was at Victor's apartment. While Victor was escorting her to her home in New Jersey the previous night, Ethel slipped on icy stairs and fell. Victor and some neighbors took her back to Victor's apartment, where they spent the night. Strangely, Ethel was wearing nothing but her undergarments and Victor's Japanese kimono. It turned out that Victor had Ethel's dress drycleaned.\n\ndoc574641: One Foot in the Grave. It is mentioned several times that Patrick would like to have children. After Pippa miscarries and Patrick is, so he claims, rendered infertile by a freak accident (for which he unfairly blames Victor), he adopts a dachshund called Denzil, which Pippa describes as his \"baby substitute\". Denzil frequently appears with Patrick through series 3-5. Despite their animosity towards each other, Victor ends up saving Patrick's life in \"The Wisdom of the Witch\".\n\ndoc574634: One Foot in the Grave. In later episodes, Margaret develops into a more complex character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode \"Hole in the Sky\", eventually leading her to destroy it. In \"The Affair of the Hollow Lady\", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops a soft spot for Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode \"Warm Champagne\". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, \"He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen.\" She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in \"Things aren't simple anymore\" where she voices that the world is \"all speed and greed\" and that \"nobody does anything about anything\". In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, \"shared their bodies\" in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had \"grabbed hold of the wrong person\". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies; one day when she opened the door of their cage, one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself, while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud in front of the whole class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.\n\ndoc652931: Brenda Fricker. Brenda Fricker (born 17 February 1945) is an Irish actress of theatre, film and television. She has appeared in more than 30 films and television roles. In 1989, she became the first Irish actress to win an Oscar, earning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for My Left Foot.

Sandra is a fish out of water next to her outspoken, serial dating, free spirited sibling who lives on an inner-city council estate.[3] But difference is just what Sandra needs and she reluctantly lets Bif drag her along to a community dance class where she meets her sister's friends, Charlie (Timothy Spall), Jackie (Joanna Lumley) and Ted (David Hayman). This colorful group of defiant and energetic third-agers start to show Sandra that retirement is a beginning, and that divorce could be her new lease of life and love.\n\ndoc2648014: Chuck Woolery.

In 2017, she played Nikki Kirkbright in ITV's Cold Feet.\n\ndoc2631278: Talk:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?/Archive 1. Chris Tarrant is on record as saying that the clash of Judith Keppel's show with the episode of One Foot In The Grave where Victor dies was just sheer coincidence.\n\ndoc574663: One Foot in the Grave. When the final episode, \"Things Aren't Simple Any More\" originally aired on 20 November 2000 at 9pm, it coincided with the broadcast of the first jackpot winner in the UK version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, which had been filmed the Sunday before the broadcast. ITV was accused of engineering this in order to damage the final episode's expected high ratings, but was later cleared by the Independent Television Commission.[27]\n\ndoc953249: Finding Your Feet. Australian film critic Stephen Romei of The Australian awarded the film 4 stars and said \"Finding Your Feet is rightly billed as comedy-drama; yet, although it\u2019s full of rib-tickling dialogue, it\u2019s the drama that cuts deep\".[14] Mark Kermode reviewed the film favourably on BBC Radio 5 Live.[15] Kevin Maher from The Times said it was \"oddly adorable\".[16] Andy Lea of The Sunday Express awarded the film 4 stars and said \"it\u2019s big-hearted, touching, smartly-written and beautifully performed by a hugely talented cast\".[17] Allan Hunter said in The Daily Express that it was \"a sentimental tearjerker elevated by a top-notch British cast\".[18] Linda Marric from HeyUGuys said the film was \"a charming, oft-told tale of second chances in life and love, filled with fine performances.\"[19] Francesca Rudkin of The New Zealand Herald compared Finding Your Feet to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Calendar Girls and said the film was a charming, if somewhat predictable, crowd-pleaser about embracing life in your later years.[20] Emma Simmonds from The List said \"the joie de vivre of these convention-defying pensioners is ultimately irresistible.\"[21] Louise Keller from Urban Cinefile said \"Finding Your Feet may be predictable fare, but it has a heart of solid gold\".[22] James Mottram from Total Film said \"Its love-in-later-life insights are well-worn, but with Staunton on song, Richard Loncraine's film mines genuine feeling\". In another positive review, The Film Blog called Finding Your Feet \"A Billy Elliot for Seniors with a meaningful slice of warmth and humour\".[23]\n\ndoc1846781: Joan Sims. She played Mrs Wembley in the BBC comedy series On the Up, which starred Dennis Waterman and ran from 1990 to 1992.

And later in the scene:\n\ndoc2089074: The Gravediggers. In most of the movie adaptations of Hamlet, the part of the First Gravedigger (and at times the Second Gravedigger) is played by an extremely established actor or comedian. The following are the actors that portrayed the Gravedigger in the most notable cinematic productions:\n\ndoc1214992: Sonequa Martin-Green. While known primarily for her television roles, Sonequa Martin-Green made her debut in film with various film roles since 2005. In 2009, she played the lead role of Tosha Spinner in Toe to Toe opposite Louisa Krause, the fiercely determined scholarship student who seeks to build a brighter future outside of Anacostia and away from one of Washington's poorest neighborhoods. The film focuses on her friendship and rivalry with Jessie (Louisa Krause), a privileged girl from Bethesda whose promiscuous tendencies threaten to become her undoing. They both strive to gain a better understanding of one another's plight as society threatens to drive them ever farther apart. The film received generally positive reviews, with Martin-Green's performance receiving critical acclaim,[10][11] even from the film's detractors.[12][13]\n\ndoc861721: Barefoot in the Park. A production of Barefoot in the Park ran at the Moore Theater  in Seattle for one week in late 1981, which was taped for a made-for-TV movie by HBO.[6][7] The play\u2014and movie\u2014starred Richard Thomas as Paul, Bess Armstrong as Corie, Barbara Barrie as Mrs. Banks, and Hans Conried as Velasco.[8][9] It was initially telecast in March 1982. The reviewer for UPI wrote: \"Richard Thomas\u2014light years removed from the John Boy image of his youth\u2014is superb as Paul Bratter, the buttoned-down young lawyer struggling to come to terms with the elfin free spirit with whom he finds himself honeymooning. Bess Armstrong glows in the role of his wife, Corrie, but Barbara Barrie virtually walks away with the show as her bemused mother.\"[10]\n\ndoc1382835: Barefoot in the Park (film). Corie (Jane Fonda), a free spirited young woman, and Paul Bratter (Robert Redford), a conservative, less free-spirited man, are a recently married couple, who move into a fifth floor apartment in Greenwich Village (one of the ongoing jokes is the fact that everyone has to climb so many stairs to get to the apartment). Corie decorates the small, leaky apartment, turning it into a picturesque little home for the two. One of the many odd people living in the apartment building, the quirky Victor Velasco (Charles Boyer), befriends Corie, even flirting with her. He lives in the attic of the building, and climbs through the Bratters' apartment window to get to his. Victor helps Corie with the apartment, teaching her how to work the seemingly broken heating and plumbing.\n\ndoc2563688: List of Dad's Army characters. Played by Arnold Ridley, Godfrey was the most frail member of the platoon, and was the platoon's medical orderly. He had served in the First World War as a conscientious-objecting stretcher bearer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, winning the Military Medal before becoming a tailor at the Army & Navy Stores. Godfrey was an amiable, vague, lifelong bachelor who lived with his sisters in an idyllic cottage, and was a martyr to his weak bladder, leading to many requests to be \"excused\". He was very loyal to Captain Mainwaring, except on one occasion when he took part in a plot to make Mainwaring's feet hurt.\n\ndoc1584351: Rise of the Footsoldier. In America, Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever also disliked it, throwing the film one bone (out of possible four) and dismissing it as \"Brit crime flick, based on a true story, that has nothing going for it but violence\". Indicating that \"Carlton Leach goes from football hooligan in the 1980s to criminal muscle and gangster in the 1990s\", the write-up ends with mention of \"three murdered drug dealers who were found in rural Essex\".\n\ndoc1849258: One Foot (Walk the Moon song). \"One Foot\" is a song by American rock band Walk the Moon for their third studio album, What If Nothing (2017). The song was released as the album's lead single on September 22, 2017.[1]\n\ndoc488167: List of Bones characters.

Doreen Mantle (born 1926) is a South African-born[1] English actress who is probably best known for her role as Jean Warboys in One Foot in the Grave (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000).[2]\n\ndoc486894: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mrs Warboys.\n\ndoc574636: One Foot in the Grave. Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Victor and Margaret Meldrew. Victor appears to be alive but Margaret does not acknowledge him, implying that he is actually a ghost after she complains about a cold air in the room.\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc486890: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Last episode directed by Susan Belbin, who had to step down during filming due to ill health, and subsequently left the BBC. Gareth Gwenlan directed the remainder of the episode without credit, and Christine Gernon took over as the series' director the following year.\n\ndoc486892: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Writer David Renwick makes a cameo appearance on Victor's TV, alongside presenter Lorraine Kelly, as a gentleman being interviewed for a feature on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\ndoc574624: One Foot in the Grave. One Foot in the Grave is a British black sitcom[1] written by David Renwick. There were six series and seven Christmas specials over an eleven-year period, from early 1990 to late 2000. The first five series were broadcast between January 1990 and January 1995. For the next five years, the show appeared only as Christmas specials, followed by one final series in 2000.\n\ndoc574647: One Foot in the Grave. Cousin Wilfred (John Rutland) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs. Warboys' cousin, Wilfred, appeared twice in the series, and was considered to be a fairly boring middle-aged man. In the final series the character returned, but the effects of a stroke rendered him mute, and forced him to \"speak\" with the aid of an electronic voice generator. His poor typing on the generator led to several misunderstandings, such as asking Victor for a \"bra of soup\" (as opposed to a \"bar of soap\") and describing a visit to his \"brothel\" (as opposed to \"brother\").\n\ndoc574660: One Foot in the Grave. The series also won the Best Television Sitcom in 1992 from the Royal Television Society and the British Comedy Award for Best Sitcom in 1992, 1995 and 2001.[22]\n\ndoc486876: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. This is a list of episodes of the British sitcom One Foot in the Grave, written by David Renwick. The show ran for six series of six episodes each. There were also nine specials including two shorts for Comic Relief, first screened from 4 January 1990 to 20 November 2000 on BBC One and subsequently repeated both on the BBC and thereafter on satellite channels such as Gold.[1] Some of the early episodes bear a 1989 copyright date. While the programme has always been shown after the 9pm watershed on the BBC, other channels have sometimes shown it in earlier slots, with minor cuts.\n\ndoc1531796: Things Aren't Simple Any More. The five previous series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health.[18] Renwick persuaded her to return to work on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again.[3] The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.[18]\n\ndoc363782: Angus Deayton. He also played Victor Meldrew's long-suffering neighbour Patrick Trench in the comedy series One Foot in the Grave, and George Windsor in the final three series of Waterloo Road.\n\ndoc366238: Enn Reitel. He also played two roles in different episodes of long-running sitcom One Foot in the Grave. In the first Christmas special, he played \"Mr. Starkey\", a down and out who holds Victor Meldrew and his neighbour's father at gunpoint to wait for Armageddon on Christmas Day. In the second episode of series 3, \"Dreamland\", he played a tramp who took a fancy to Victor's shoes, but drew the line at his Noel Edmonds-esque sweater.\n\ndoc486884: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc574638: One Foot in the Grave. Despite being friends, she has driven Margaret to distraction on several occasions. Most notably in \"Only a Story\", when she stayed with the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret to the point of distraction with her complaining and laziness. Jean was also shown as a somewhat absent-minded character, as she has a pet cockatiel despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while having a conversation with someone else. Doreen Mantle described her character as \"wanting to do the right thing but always finding out that it was the wrong thing\".[12]\n\ndoc574626: One Foot in the Grave. The series was occasionally the subject of controversy for some of its darker story elements, but nevertheless received a number of awards, including the 1992 BAFTA for Best Comedy. The programme came 80th in the British Film Institute's 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.[4] The series, originally shown on BBC One, is now available on DVD and is regularly repeated in the United Kingdom. Four episodes were remade for BBC Radio 2[5] The series inspired a novel, published in 1992, featuring the most memorable moments from the first two series and the first Christmas special.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc1758231: Owen Brenman. Owen Brenman (born 17 December 1956 in London) is an English actor best known for his role as next-door neighbour Nick Swainey in the multi-award-winning BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave, which ran for ten years (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000) and was written by David Renwick. He currently plays Dr. Heston Carter in the BBC drama series Doctors[1]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\ndoc574652: One Foot in the Grave. The production of the show was in a conventional sitcom format, with episodes taped live in front of a studio audience, interposed with pre-filmed location material.[6]\n\ndoc486882: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Nick Swainey (and his unseen mother) become the Meldrews' next door neighbours with this episode.\n\ndoc574633: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574659: One Foot in the Grave. The programme received a number of prestigious awards. In 1992, it won a BAFTA as Best Comedy (Programme or Series). During its ten-year run, the series was nominated a further six times. Richard Wilson also won Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1992 and 1994, and Annette Crosbie was nominated for the same award in 1994.\n\ndoc486898: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. A series of remakes originally broadcast on BBC Radio 2, with Richard Wilson, Annette Crosbie, Owen Brenman and Doreen Mantle reprising their TV roles. Its original run coincided with the broadcast of TV series 5. All episodes are 30 minutes long and produced by Diane Messias. They were subsequently issued on audio cassette, CD and audio download.\n\ndoc486887: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Richard Wilson is the only actor to appear in this episode. As a result, this is the only one of the 42 episodes that Annette Crosbie does not appear.\n\ndoc486886: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: This episode was edited after broadcast due to complaints over the elderly abuse scene. The song \"Out of Town\" by Max Bygraves is featured.\n\ndoc486885: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Cousin Wilfred and Ronnie and Mildred.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc486879: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. All six series and specials were initially available on BBC Worldwide VHS video tapes. The Comic Relief Shorts from 1993 and 2001 have not been released on DVD. One Foot in the Grave Best-of was also released in Region 4, 8 July 2004.\n\ndoc574639: One Foot in the Grave. Patrick Trench (Angus Deayton) \u2013 Patrick and his wife Pippa live next door to Victor, and often catches Victor engrossed in seemingly preposterous situations, all of which in context are perfectly innocuous. The couple's relationship with their neighbours begins badly after Victor mistakes Patrick and Pippa for distant relations when they arrive outside with three suitcases\u00a0\u2013 not realising that they are his next-door neighbours, having been on a lengthy holiday from the day Victor and Margaret moved in. Victor subsequently invites the bemused pair to stay; this and later incidents cause Patrick to suspect that Victor is quite insane, possibly bordering on malicious.\n\ndoc363788: Angus Deayton. In 1990, Deayton was cast as the Meldrews' neighbour Patrick Trench in the British suburban sitcom One Foot in the Grave and was selected as host of Have I Got News for You. The same year, he featured on television advertising the Vauxhall Nova. Andre Ptaszynski tried to persuade him to take the lead role in Steven Moffat's sitcom Chalk, a role eventually taken by David Bamber.[4]\n\ndoc574643: One Foot in the Grave. New neighbours Derek and Betty McVitie replaced the Trenches for the 1997 special \"Endgame\", however this turned out to be their only appearances in the series and they were said to have emigrated by the penultimate episode which caused Nick Swainey to leap straight in with the offer for their old house. Series six saw the Trenches return as prominent characters, albeit living in a house some distance from the Meldrews. Despite appearing in five out of six series and three Christmas specials, neither of the Trenches ever share a scene with Mrs Warboys, and Pippa only ever shares one scene with Nick Swainey (in the episode \"Who Will Buy?\").\n\ndoc574649: One Foot in the Grave. Mimsy Berkovitz - Another unseen character, she is the local agony aunt, whom many of the characters turn to for advice. In the episode \"The Secret of the Seven Sorcerers\", Patrick is heard talking to her on the radio, seeking her advice on how to cope when Victor and Margaret invite him and Pippa around to dinner.\n\ndoc574656: One Foot in the Grave. Over the show's history, it featured a number of notable comic actors in one-off roles. These included Susie Blake, John Bird, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Peter Cook, Diana Coupland, Phil Daniels, Edward de Souza, Hannah Gordon, Georgina Hale, Jimmy Jewel, Rula Lenska, Stephen Lewis, Brian Murphy, Christopher Ryan, Barbara Windsor, Joan Sims and Ray Winstone. Two of Angus Deayton's former Radio Active and KYTV co-stars, Geoffrey Perkins and Michael Fenton Stevens were cast, in separate episodes, as respectively the brother and brother-in-law of Deayton's character. A few actors little-known at the time also appeared in one-off roles before going on to greater fame, including Lucy Davis, Joanna Scanlan, Eamonn Walker and Arabella Weir.\n\ndoc1531784: Things Aren't Simple Any More. \"Things Aren't Simple Any More\" is the final episode of the British television sitcom One Foot in the Grave. It was written by David Renwick and stars Richard Wilson as Victor Meldrew, Annette Crosbie as his wife Margaret, and features guest appearances by Hannah Gordon and Paul Merton. The episode depicts the death of the series' protagonist, Victor Meldrew, in a hit-and-run road accident, and his wife's efforts to deal with the driver who killed him. Renwick had been struggling to conceive and write new stories for the series and decided to kill off the character. The episode was filmed at Shawford, Hampshire, and at BBC Television Centre in London.[3]\n\ndoc574661: One Foot in the Grave. In 2004, One Foot in the Grave came tenth in a BBC poll to find \"Britain's Best Sitcom\" with 31,410 votes.[23] The programme also came 80th in the British Film Institute's 100 Greatest British Television Programmes [4]\n\ndoc486889: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mildred. The song \"No Particular Place to Go\" by Chuck Berry is featured.\n\ndoc486895: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Nick Swainey and Patrick and Pippa.\n\ndoc486893: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Ronnie and Cousin Wilfred.\n\ndoc574632: One Foot in the Grave. Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) \u2013 Victor is the main protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself constantly battling against all that life throws at him as he becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser.[11] From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after an automatic security system made him redundant at the office where he worked as a security guard, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor does not see himself as retired and is always trying to find another job, but all his attempts end in failure. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite fa\u00e7ade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. \"Victor-isms\" include \"I do not believe it!\", \"I don't believe it!\", \"Un-be-lievable!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?\", \"In the name of sanity!\". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassion\u2014in \"Hearts of Darkness\" he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in \"Descent Into The Maelstrom\" he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 42 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says \"You were always my first choice\", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode \"The Wisdom of the Witch\" in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, out of the window of the house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.\n\ndoc486888: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes.

NOTE: First appearances of Patrick and Pippa\n\ndoc574667: One Foot in the Grave. All six series and specials were initially available on BBC Worldwide VHS video tapes during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Comic Relief Shorts from 1993 and 2001 have not been released on DVD. A One Foot in the Grave Very Best Of DVD featuring five of the greatest episodes was released on 22 October 2001 in Region 2. Then on 8 July 2004, a One Foot in the Grave Very Best Of was also released in Region 4. Each series was gradually released on DVD in Region 2 between 2004 and 2006, with a complete series 1-6 box set towards the end of 2006. A slimmer series 1-6 box set was released in 2010 in Region 2.\n\ndoc574642: One Foot in the Grave. Pippa Trench (n\u00e9e Croker) (Janine Duvitski) \u2013 Patrick's wife sought friendly relations with the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men to make peace with each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home, thinking they were removal men who had initially come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a house clearance firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a \"gormless twerp\" on an answering machine message, unaware she was listening)\u00a0\u2013 for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one domino in his hand, and Victor had two pimples on his nose.\n\ndoc574666: One Foot in the Grave. Wilson dislikes saying his character's catchphrase (\"I don't believe it!\") and only performs the line for charity events for a small fee.[31] This became a joke in the actor's guest appearance as himself in the Father Ted episode \"The Mainland\", where Ted annoys him by constantly repeating his catchphrase. The situation was conceived when Father Ted writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews sat behind Wilson at a performance of Le Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall. They considered how \"tasteless and wrong\" it would be to lean forward to him every time that an acrobat did a stunt and yell the catchphrase, and then they realised that that's exactly what their fictional priests would do.[32] This was also played upon when Wilson made a guest appearance on the comedy TV quiz show Shooting Stars, in which Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer purposefully misquoted his catchphrase by referring to him as \"Richard 'I don't believe you' Wilson\".\n\ndoc574654: One Foot in the Grave. One Foot used Bournemouth to film some exterior sequences because of its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the house\u2014near Pokesdown, Bournemouth\u2014which had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed hands and the new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees that the previous owners had asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided to find a new house, and the first episode of the second series was rewritten to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire (this was filmed on waste ground in Northcote Road, Springbourne). This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.[14]\n\ndoc574651: One Foot in the Grave. Martin Trout (Peter Cook) - A paparazzo in \"One Foot in the Algarve\". He manages to take a number of compromising photographs, involving a high-ranking politician. Trout compares the potential impact of the photos to the Profumo affair. On his way to sell the images, he loses the roll of film whilst arguing at a phone box with the Meldrews and subsequently pursues them across the Algarve to retrieve it. He suffers a number of disasters both related and unrelated to Victor and Margaret's own misfortunes, only to find that the film had actually fallen into the lining of his jacket and had been with him for much of his journey. He lost it in the door of the Meldrews' car. Retrieving the roll after a brief spell in hospital, Trout attempts to leave the Algarve in a taxi but is involved in a car crash.\n\ndoc574629: One Foot in the Grave. Although set in a traditional suburban setting, the show subverts this genre with a strong overtone of black comedy. Series One's \"The Valley of Fear\" is an episode which caused controversy, when Victor finds a frozen cat in his freezer. Writer David Renwick also combined farce with elements of tragedy.[6] For example, in the final episode, Victor is killed by a hit-and-run driver, and although there is no explicit reference that Victor and Margaret had children, the episode \"Timeless Time\" contained a reference to someone named Stuart; the strong implication being that they once had a son who had died as a child.[5][7][8]\n\ndoc574644: One Foot in the Grave. Nick Swainey (Owen Brenman) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The excessively cheerful and often oblivious Mr Swainey appeared in the first episode, encouraging Victor to join his OAPs' trip to Eastbourne, and being greeted with Victor's trademark abuse. When the Meldrews move house, they discover he is their neighbour, living on the other side of the Meldrews from the Trenches. He remains continuously optimistic; even his being told to \"piss off\" by Victor is laughed off. Despite this run-in he later befriends Victor, and they frequently chat in their gardens, where Victor is often surprised by Mr Swainey's activities, ranging from archery and preparing amateur dramatics props, to bizarre games he arranges for his bedridden senile mother, whom the audience never actually see. Despite his cheery demeanour, he does occasionally drop his guard, once displaying apparent depression at being nothing more than \"an overgrown boy-scout\". Following his mother's death, he moved house near the end of the series, but only went as far as the Trenches'/McVitie's old house, claiming he'd always wanted to live in an \"end house, without leaving the area\". This took Victor by surprise; he did not learn where Mr Swainey was moving to until, while reminiscing in the garden about his departure, Mr Swainey suddenly appeared from the other side.\n\ndoc486891: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Only appearances of Derek and Betty McVitie. Features the song \"River Runs Deep\" performed by JJ Cale.\n\ndoc574665: One Foot in the Grave. Renwick integrated some of the plots and dialogue from the series into a novel, which was first published by BBC Books in 1992. Renwick also adapted four episodes for BBC Radio 2, which first aired between 21 January 1995 and 11 February 1995.[5] The episodes are \"Alive and Buried\", \"In Luton Airport, No One Can Hear You Scream\", \"Timeless Time\" and \"The Beast in the Cage\". They are regularly repeated on the digital speech station BBC Radio 4 Extra and are available on audio CD.\n\ndoc574645: One Foot in the Grave. Ronnie and Mildred (Gordon Peters and Barbara Ashcroft) \u2013 Ronnie and Mildred were a constantly cheerful, but incredibly boring, couple who provided yet another annoyance to the Meldrews, who dreaded any upcoming visits to them; Victor once said that he had hoped they were both dead. In \"The Worst Horror of All\", when the couple attempted a surprise visit, the Meldrews hid in their house to give the impression they were away on holiday, and then took the phone off the hook for several days afterwards, though these efforts to avoid them were in vain. They are referenced a number of times in the series for giving the Meldrews bizarre and always unwanted presents that are seldom opened, usually involving a garish photograph of themselves. In the final series, however it was clear that their cheerfulness was a fa\u00e7ade and, in a particularly dark scene, Mildred hanged herself \"during a game of Happy Families\". The shot of Mildred's feet dangling outside the window is usually cut from pre-watershed screenings.\n\ndoc574635: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret could be said to have a catchphrase - typically a long, exasperated use of the word \"God\", usually when making a realisation about the reasons behind one of Victor's mishaps. These are occasionally inadvertently aided by herself in some way, such as leaving the phone off the hook or giving permission to someone to enter the Meldrews' house when she isn't there.\n\ndoc486896: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: The song that's played over the ending of the episode is \"End of the Line\" by the Traveling Wilburys. In the US release of the DVD the song is replaced by stock music. The reason for this is presumably the music clearance rights were not granted for US viewers.\n\ndoc574657: One Foot in the Grave. The show was produced with an aspect ratio of 4:3 from 1990 to 1997. Three years later, the show returned to television for its final series, which was produced with an aspect ratio of 16:9. All episodes are of Standard Definition 576i.\n\ndoc574640: One Foot in the Grave. However, Patrick's rift with Victor eventually transforms him into a rather cynical character (much like Victor), and he often responds to him in similarly vindictive ways as a means of trying to settle the score. For example, writing complaints and grievances on post-it notes. This aspect of Patrick's character came to a head in the episode \"The Executioner's Song\" where his face temporarily morphs into that of Victor's as he looks into a mirror.\n\ndoc574662: One Foot in the Grave. A number of complaints were made during the series' run for its depiction of animal deaths. For example, in the episode \"The Valley of Fear\", a dead cat is found in the Meldrews' freezer; in another, a tortoise is roasted in a brazier. However, this was later cited as a positive feature of the programme's daring scripts in Britain's Best Sitcom by its advocate Rowland Rivron.[24] The programme was censured, however, for a scene in the episode \"Hearts of Darkness\" in which an elderly resident is abused in an old people's home, and following complaints, the scene was slightly cut when the episode was repeated.[25] In the DVD commentary for the episode, David Renwick stated his continued opposition to the cuts.[26] Another controversial scene in the episode \"Tales of Terror\" saw the Meldrews visit Ronnie and Mildred on the understanding that Mildred had gone upstairs during a game of Happy Families and not returned; Ronnie then shows her feet hanging outside of the window, revealing that she has committed suicide. The Broadcasting Standards Commission received complaints about this scene.[8]\n\ndoc574658: One Foot in the Grave. The One Foot in the Grave theme song was written, composed and sung by Eric Idle. A longer version was produced for the special \"One Foot in the Algarve\", released as a single with five remixes and a karaoke version in November 1994.[19] Idle included a live version of the song on his album Eric Idle Sings Monty Python.[20] It is preluded by a similar adaptation of \"Bread of Heaven\" to that used in the episode \"The Beast in the Cage\" by disgruntled car mechanics.[9][21] The title music on the TV series is accompanied at the beginning and end of each episode by footage of Galapagos tortoises. The series also made extensive use of incidental music, composed by Ed Welch, which often hinted at a particular genre to fit the mood of the scenes, frequently incorporating well-known pieces of music such as \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\" or Intermezzo from Jean Sibelius' Karelia Suite. In the Christmas special \"Endgame\" during Margaret's alleged death scene, a compilation of clips from past episodes are accompanied by the song \"River Runs Deep\" performed by J. J. Cale. The final episode ended with a montage of some of the mishaps Victor encountered, which were mentioned in the episode\u00a0\u2013 backed by \"End of the Line\" by the Traveling Wilburys.\n\ndoc1738127: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Wilson's biography, One Foot on the Stage: The Biography of Richard Wilson, was written by James Roose-Evans.[11]\n\ndoc574655: One Foot in the Grave. Since series two, the exterior scenes of the Meldrew's home were filmed at Tresillian Way, Walkford, near New Milton in Hampshire.[15] These later series make extensive use of specific street and garden locations in most episodes, particularly for scenes involving the Meldrew's neighbours.[16] Most outside locations were filmed in and around Bournemouth and Christchurch. These include Richmond Hill, Undercliff Drive and Boscombe Pier, Bournemouth Town Hall, Lansdowne College, Christchurch Hospital and the former Royal Victoria Hospital (Boscombe). Later episodes, such as \"Hearts of Darkness\", were filmed entirely on location. Victor's death by a hit and run driver in the final episode was filmed at Shawford railway station, Hampshire. Fans left floral tributes at the site.[17][18]\n\ndoc614653: Jonathan Creek. Others who were tried for the part included Nigel Planer (who would later guest star) and Angus Deayton (who had previously worked with Renwick and director Susan Belbin on One Foot in the Grave). Almost a dozen actors were considered before Susan Belbin saw Alan Davies during a rehearsal for a sitcom. Davies was invited round to talk to Renwick and \"turned up in his duffle coat with straggly hair and a broad grin [and] was self-evidently the closest match yet to Creek as we had always seen him\".[9]\n\ndoc574646: One Foot in the Grave. Alfred Meldrew (Richard Pearson) - Victor's absent-minded brother, who lives in New Zealand. During the episode \"The Broken Reflection\", he comes to visit after 25 years, to the disdain of Victor. Alfred is an eccentric character, often walking around with his hat on fire, and bringing over his and Victor's great-grandfather's skull. He is a clumsy character too, mistaking the table-cloth for a napkin and dropping the entire contents of the table all over the floor when he stands up, and breaking a mirror in the middle of the night after mistaking his own reflection for a burglar. Victor starts to warm to Alfred towards the end of his visit, but Alfred leaves early the next day after finding an unpleasant message about him that Victor had accidentally recorded on a dictaphone. He is not seen again, but keeps in touch with the Meldrews, as Victor is seen looking at some photographs Alfred had sent over in \"The Trial\".\n\ndoc1738130: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Wilson was a supporter of his local football club, Greenock Morton, but he has come to lend greater support to English club Manchester United.[14] He is a patron of the Manchester United Supporters Trust.[15] Wilson has been a campaigner for gay rights for many years,[16] and he came out as gay in a Daily Mail interview in March 2013.[17] Wilson is good friends with his One Foot in the Grave co-star Angus Deayton, and is godfather to Deayton's son.[18]\n\ndoc574648: One Foot in the Grave. Great Aunt Joyce and Uncle Dick - Unseen characters, they are often mentioned by Victor and Margaret, as an aging and grim couple and Victor and Margaret dread having anything to do with them. Great Aunt Joyce is mentioned as having a glass eye and has the habit of knitting bizarre items (such as six-fingered gloves) for Victor. Uncle Dick has a wooden arm; in the final Comic Relief (2001) episode, it transpires that a nurse had mistakenly placed a drip in the false arm for 18 hours after a trip to hospital after trying to remove a kidney stone with a wire coat hanger.\n\ndoc1382830: Barefoot in the Park (film). Barefoot in the Park is a 1967 American comedy film starring Jane Fonda as Corie, and Robert Redford as Paul.\n\ndoc1531803: Things Aren't Simple Any More. Salmon agreed not to broadcast the episode at Christmas.[3] It was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000,[2] forty minutes in length, rather than usual thirty. The episode's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don't Believe It! The One Foot In The Grave Story, a documentary presented by Angus Deayton which looked back at the hit sitcom.[23] The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release.\n\ndoc119098: Prince Hamlet. Although, the difference between a sexton and a grave digger must also be taken into account. A sexton oversees many different jobs around the church and surrounding areas. A grave digger simply digs graves. There are sextons who also dig graves and some that do not. It is completely possible that the Gravedigger has been a sexton for 30 years, but has not been digging graves for that entire time. This could be another example of the character's very round-about way of speaking.\n\ndoc2563632: List of Hotel Transylvania characters. In Good Night Mr. Foot, one Witch (voiced by Rose Abdoo) was shown bothering Bigfoot which ended with a pillow fight.\n\ndoc2089054: The Gravediggers. The Second Gravedigger exits as Hamlet and Horatio enter, and the First Gravedigger begins to sing a song on the topics of love and graves as he digs. He throws a skull (and later a second) up and out of the grave. Hamlet then talks to Horatio about how inappropriate it is to treat what used to be someone's, and possibly an important someone's, body in such a way. He decides to ask the Gravedigger whose grave he is digging, but the Gravedigger will not reveal the answer without another witty exchange.\n\ndoc1382837: Barefoot in the Park (film). The next day, Paul comes home with a fever, but Corie still insists she wants a divorce. The two spend an awkward time together in their apartment before Corie kicks Paul out. She then gets a call from her aunt, saying that Ethel did not come home. Corie panics, and eventually finds out that her mother was at Victor's apartment. While Victor was escorting her to her home in New Jersey the previous night, Ethel slipped on icy stairs and fell. Victor and some neighbors took her back to Victor's apartment, where they spent the night. Strangely, Ethel was wearing nothing but her undergarments and Victor's Japanese kimono. It turned out that Victor had Ethel's dress drycleaned.\n\ndoc574641: One Foot in the Grave. It is mentioned several times that Patrick would like to have children. After Pippa miscarries and Patrick is, so he claims, rendered infertile by a freak accident (for which he unfairly blames Victor), he adopts a dachshund called Denzil, which Pippa describes as his \"baby substitute\". Denzil frequently appears with Patrick through series 3-5. Despite their animosity towards each other, Victor ends up saving Patrick's life in \"The Wisdom of the Witch\".\n\ndoc574634: One Foot in the Grave. In later episodes, Margaret develops into a more complex character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode \"Hole in the Sky\", eventually leading her to destroy it. In \"The Affair of the Hollow Lady\", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops a soft spot for Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode \"Warm Champagne\". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, \"He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen.\" She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in \"Things aren't simple anymore\" where she voices that the world is \"all speed and greed\" and that \"nobody does anything about anything\". In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, \"shared their bodies\" in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had \"grabbed hold of the wrong person\". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies; one day when she opened the door of their cage, one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself, while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud in front of the whole class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.\n\ndoc652931: Brenda Fricker. Brenda Fricker (born 17 February 1945) is an Irish actress of theatre, film and television. She has appeared in more than 30 films and television roles. In 1989, she became the first Irish actress to win an Oscar, earning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for My Left Foot. As of July 2014, she has tentatively retired from acting.[1]\n\ndoc953243: Finding Your Feet. \u2018Lady\u2019 Sandra Abbott (Imelda Staunton) discovers that her husband of forty years (John Sessions) is having an affair with her best friend (Josie Lawrence), she seeks refuge in London with her estranged, older sister Bif (Celia Imrie). Sandra is a fish out of water next to her outspoken, serial dating, free spirited sibling who lives on an inner-city council estate.[3] But difference is just what Sandra needs and she reluctantly lets Bif drag her along to a community dance class where she meets her sister's friends, Charlie (Timothy Spall), Jackie (Joanna Lumley) and Ted (David Hayman). This colorful group of defiant and energetic third-agers start to show Sandra that retirement is a beginning, and that divorce could be her new lease of life and love.\n\ndoc2648014: Chuck Woolery. As an actor, he has appeared with Stephen Boyd, Rosey Grier and Cheryl Ladd in the mid-1970s film Evil in the Deep.[5] He appeared as himself in the 1989 film Cold Feet that starred Keith Carradine and Rip Torn.[6]\n\ndoc1080421: Siobhan Finneran. In 2017, she played Nikki Kirkbright in ITV's Cold Feet.\n\ndoc2631278: Talk:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?/Archive 1. Chris Tarrant is on record as saying that the clash of Judith Keppel's show with the episode of One Foot In The Grave where Victor dies was just sheer coincidence.\n\ndoc574663: One Foot in the Grave. When the final episode, \"Things Aren't Simple Any More\" originally aired on 20 November 2000 at 9pm, it coincided with the broadcast of the first jackpot winner in the UK version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, which had been filmed the Sunday before the broadcast. ITV was accused of engineering this in order to damage the final episode's expected high ratings, but was later cleared by the Independent Television Commission.[27]\n\ndoc953249: Finding Your Feet. Australian film critic Stephen Romei of The Australian awarded the film 4 stars and said \"Finding Your Feet is rightly billed as comedy-drama; yet, although it\u2019s full of rib-tickling dialogue, it\u2019s the drama that cuts deep\".[14] Mark Kermode reviewed the film favourably on BBC Radio 5 Live.[15] Kevin Maher from The Times said it was \"oddly adorable\".[16] Andy Lea of The Sunday Express awarded the film 4 stars and said \"it\u2019s big-hearted, touching, smartly-written and beautifully performed by a hugely talented cast\".[17] Allan Hunter said in The Daily Express that it was \"a sentimental tearjerker elevated by a top-notch British cast\".[18] Linda Marric from HeyUGuys said the film was \"a charming, oft-told tale of second chances in life and love, filled with fine performances.\"[19] Francesca Rudkin of The New Zealand Herald compared Finding Your Feet to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Calendar Girls and said the film was a charming, if somewhat predictable, crowd-pleaser about embracing life in your later years.[20] Emma Simmonds from The List said \"the joie de vivre of these convention-defying pensioners is ultimately irresistible.\"[21] Louise Keller from Urban Cinefile said \"Finding Your Feet may be predictable fare, but it has a heart of solid gold\".[22] James Mottram from Total Film said \"Its love-in-later-life insights are well-worn, but with Staunton on song, Richard Loncraine's film mines genuine feeling\". In another positive review, The Film Blog called Finding Your Feet \"A Billy Elliot for Seniors with a meaningful slice of warmth and humour\".[23]\n\ndoc1846781: Joan Sims. She played Mrs Wembley in the BBC comedy series On the Up, which starred Dennis Waterman and ran from 1990 to 1992. From 1994, she played Madge Hardcastle, drum playing wife to Rocky Hardcastle played by Frank Middlemass, and stepmother of Geoffrey Palmer's character Lionel in As Time Goes By. Sims also appeared in episodes of the hit television comedy series Only Fools and Horses, the 1987 Christmas Day special The Frog's Legacy, and The Goodies, in the One Foot in the Grave special One Foot in the Algarve, and made a guest appearance in a sketch show with Victoria Wood.\n\ndoc2089059: The Gravediggers. And later in the scene:\n\ndoc2089074: The Gravediggers. In most of the movie adaptations of Hamlet, the part of the First Gravedigger (and at times the Second Gravedigger) is played by an extremely established actor or comedian. The following are the actors that portrayed the Gravedigger in the most notable cinematic productions:\n\ndoc1214992: Sonequa Martin-Green. While known primarily for her television roles, Sonequa Martin-Green made her debut in film with various film roles since 2005. In 2009, she played the lead role of Tosha Spinner in Toe to Toe opposite Louisa Krause, the fiercely determined scholarship student who seeks to build a brighter future outside of Anacostia and away from one of Washington's poorest neighborhoods. The film focuses on her friendship and rivalry with Jessie (Louisa Krause), a privileged girl from Bethesda whose promiscuous tendencies threaten to become her undoing. They both strive to gain a better understanding of one another's plight as society threatens to drive them ever farther apart. The film received generally positive reviews, with Martin-Green's performance receiving critical acclaim,[10][11] even from the film's detractors.[12][13]\n\ndoc861721: Barefoot in the Park. A production of Barefoot in the Park ran at the Moore Theater  in Seattle for one week in late 1981, which was taped for a made-for-TV movie by HBO.[6][7] The play\u2014and movie\u2014starred Richard Thomas as Paul, Bess Armstrong as Corie, Barbara Barrie as Mrs. Banks, and Hans Conried as Velasco.[8][9] It was initially telecast in March 1982. The reviewer for UPI wrote: \"Richard Thomas\u2014light years removed from the John Boy image of his youth\u2014is superb as Paul Bratter, the buttoned-down young lawyer struggling to come to terms with the elfin free spirit with whom he finds himself honeymooning. Bess Armstrong glows in the role of his wife, Corrie, but Barbara Barrie virtually walks away with the show as her bemused mother.\"[10]\n\ndoc1382835: Barefoot in the Park (film). Corie (Jane Fonda), a free spirited young woman, and Paul Bratter (Robert Redford), a conservative, less free-spirited man, are a recently married couple, who move into a fifth floor apartment in Greenwich Village (one of the ongoing jokes is the fact that everyone has to climb so many stairs to get to the apartment). Corie decorates the small, leaky apartment, turning it into a picturesque little home for the two. One of the many odd people living in the apartment building, the quirky Victor Velasco (Charles Boyer), befriends Corie, even flirting with her. He lives in the attic of the building, and climbs through the Bratters' apartment window to get to his. Victor helps Corie with the apartment, teaching her how to work the seemingly broken heating and plumbing.\n\ndoc2563688: List of Dad's Army characters. Played by Arnold Ridley, Godfrey was the most frail member of the platoon, and was the platoon's medical orderly. He had served in the First World War as a conscientious-objecting stretcher bearer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, winning the Military Medal before becoming a tailor at the Army & Navy Stores. Godfrey was an amiable, vague, lifelong bachelor who lived with his sisters in an idyllic cottage, and was a martyr to his weak bladder, leading to many requests to be \"excused\". He was very loyal to Captain Mainwaring, except on one occasion when he took part in a plot to make Mainwaring's feet hurt.\n\ndoc1584351: Rise of the Footsoldier. In America, Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever also disliked it, throwing the film one bone (out of possible four) and dismissing it as \"Brit crime flick, based on a true story, that has nothing going for it but violence\". Indicating that \"Carlton Leach goes from football hooligan in the 1980s to criminal muscle and gangster in the 1990s\", the write-up ends with mention of \"three murdered drug dealers who were found in rural Essex\".\n\ndoc1849258: One Foot (Walk the Moon song). \"One Foot\" is a song by American rock band Walk the Moon for their third studio album, What If Nothing (2017). The song was released as the album's lead single on September 22, 2017.[1]\n\ndoc488167: List of Bones characters.

Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Victor and Margaret Meldrew. Victor appears to be alive but Margaret does not acknowledge him, implying that he is actually a ghost after she complains about a cold air in the room.\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc486890: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Last episode directed by Susan Belbin, who had to step down during filming due to ill health, and subsequently left the BBC. Gareth Gwenlan directed the remainder of the episode without credit, and Christine Gernon took over as the series' director the following year.\n\ndoc486892: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Writer David Renwick makes a cameo appearance on Victor's TV, alongside presenter Lorraine Kelly, as a gentleman being interviewed for a feature on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\ndoc574624: One Foot in the Grave. One Foot in the Grave is a British black sitcom[1] written by David Renwick. There were six series and seven Christmas specials over an eleven-year period, from early 1990 to late 2000. The first five series were broadcast between January 1990 and January 1995. For the next five years, the show appeared only as Christmas specials, followed by one final series in 2000.\n\ndoc574647: One Foot in the Grave. Cousin Wilfred (John Rutland) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs. Warboys' cousin, Wilfred, appeared twice in the series, and was considered to be a fairly boring middle-aged man. In the final series the character returned, but the effects of a stroke rendered him mute, and forced him to \"speak\" with the aid of an electronic voice generator. His poor typing on the generator led to several misunderstandings, such as asking Victor for a \"bra of soup\" (as opposed to a \"bar of soap\") and describing a visit to his \"brothel\" (as opposed to \"brother\").\n\ndoc574660: One Foot in the Grave. The series also won the Best Television Sitcom in 1992 from the Royal Television Society and the British Comedy Award for Best Sitcom in 1992, 1995 and 2001.[22]\n\ndoc486876: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. This is a list of episodes of the British sitcom One Foot in the Grave, written by David Renwick. The show ran for six series of six episodes each. There were also nine specials including two shorts for Comic Relief, first screened from 4 January 1990 to 20 November 2000 on BBC One and subsequently repeated both on the BBC and thereafter on satellite channels such as Gold.[1] Some of the early episodes bear a 1989 copyright date. While the programme has always been shown after the 9pm watershed on the BBC, other channels have sometimes shown it in earlier slots, with minor cuts.\n\ndoc1531796: Things Aren't Simple Any More. The five previous series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health.[18] Renwick persuaded her to return to work on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again.[3] The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.[18]\n\ndoc363782: Angus Deayton. He also played Victor Meldrew's long-suffering neighbour Patrick Trench in the comedy series One Foot in the Grave, and George Windsor in the final three series of Waterloo Road.\n\ndoc366238: Enn Reitel. He also played two roles in different episodes of long-running sitcom One Foot in the Grave. In the first Christmas special, he played \"Mr. Starkey\", a down and out who holds Victor Meldrew and his neighbour's father at gunpoint to wait for Armageddon on Christmas Day. In the second episode of series 3, \"Dreamland\", he played a tramp who took a fancy to Victor's shoes, but drew the line at his Noel Edmonds-esque sweater.\n\ndoc486884: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc574638: One Foot in the Grave. Despite being friends, she has driven Margaret to distraction on several occasions. Most notably in \"Only a Story\", when she stayed with the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret to the point of distraction with her complaining and laziness. Jean was also shown as a somewhat absent-minded character, as she has a pet cockatiel despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while having a conversation with someone else. Doreen Mantle described her character as \"wanting to do the right thing but always finding out that it was the wrong thing\".[12]\n\ndoc574626: One Foot in the Grave. The series was occasionally the subject of controversy for some of its darker story elements, but nevertheless received a number of awards, including the 1992 BAFTA for Best Comedy. The programme came 80th in the British Film Institute's 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.[4] The series, originally shown on BBC One, is now available on DVD and is regularly repeated in the United Kingdom. Four episodes were remade for BBC Radio 2[5] The series inspired a novel, published in 1992, featuring the most memorable moments from the first two series and the first Christmas special.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc1758231: Owen Brenman. Owen Brenman (born 17 December 1956 in London) is an English actor best known for his role as next-door neighbour Nick Swainey in the multi-award-winning BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave, which ran for ten years (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000) and was written by David Renwick. He currently plays Dr. Heston Carter in the BBC drama series Doctors[1]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\ndoc574652: One Foot in the Grave. The production of the show was in a conventional sitcom format, with episodes taped live in front of a studio audience, interposed with pre-filmed location material.[6]\n\ndoc486882: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Nick Swainey (and his unseen mother) become the Meldrews' next door neighbours with this episode.\n\ndoc574633: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574659: One Foot in the Grave. The programme received a number of prestigious awards. In 1992, it won a BAFTA as Best Comedy (Programme or Series). During its ten-year run, the series was nominated a further six times. Richard Wilson also won Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1992 and 1994, and Annette Crosbie was nominated for the same award in 1994.\n\ndoc486898: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. A series of remakes originally broadcast on BBC Radio 2, with Richard Wilson, Annette Crosbie, Owen Brenman and Doreen Mantle reprising their TV roles. Its original run coincided with the broadcast of TV series 5. All episodes are 30 minutes long and produced by Diane Messias. They were subsequently issued on audio cassette, CD and audio download.\n\ndoc486887: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Richard Wilson is the only actor to appear in this episode. As a result, this is the only one of the 42 episodes that Annette Crosbie does not appear.\n\ndoc486886: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: This episode was edited after broadcast due to complaints over the elderly abuse scene. The song \"Out of Town\" by Max Bygraves is featured.\n\ndoc486885: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Cousin Wilfred and Ronnie and Mildred.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc486879: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. All six series and specials were initially available on BBC Worldwide VHS video tapes. The Comic Relief Shorts from 1993 and 2001 have not been released on DVD. One Foot in the Grave Best-of was also released in Region 4, 8 July 2004.\n\ndoc574639: One Foot in the Grave. Patrick Trench (Angus Deayton) \u2013 Patrick and his wife Pippa live next door to Victor, and often catches Victor engrossed in seemingly preposterous situations, all of which in context are perfectly innocuous. The couple's relationship with their neighbours begins badly after Victor mistakes Patrick and Pippa for distant relations when they arrive outside with three suitcases\u00a0\u2013 not realising that they are his next-door neighbours, having been on a lengthy holiday from the day Victor and Margaret moved in. Victor subsequently invites the bemused pair to stay; this and later incidents cause Patrick to suspect that Victor is quite insane, possibly bordering on malicious.\n\ndoc363788: Angus Deayton. In 1990, Deayton was cast as the Meldrews' neighbour Patrick Trench in the British suburban sitcom One Foot in the Grave and was selected as host of Have I Got News for You. The same year, he featured on television advertising the Vauxhall Nova. Andre Ptaszynski tried to persuade him to take the lead role in Steven Moffat's sitcom Chalk, a role eventually taken by David Bamber.[4]\n\ndoc574643: One Foot in the Grave. New neighbours Derek and Betty McVitie replaced the Trenches for the 1997 special \"Endgame\", however this turned out to be their only appearances in the series and they were said to have emigrated by the penultimate episode which caused Nick Swainey to leap straight in with the offer for their old house. Series six saw the Trenches return as prominent characters, albeit living in a house some distance from the Meldrews. Despite appearing in five out of six series and three Christmas specials, neither of the Trenches ever share a scene with Mrs Warboys, and Pippa only ever shares one scene with Nick Swainey (in the episode \"Who Will Buy?\").\n\ndoc574649: One Foot in the Grave. Mimsy Berkovitz - Another unseen character, she is the local agony aunt, whom many of the characters turn to for advice. In the episode \"The Secret of the Seven Sorcerers\", Patrick is heard talking to her on the radio, seeking her advice on how to cope when Victor and Margaret invite him and Pippa around to dinner.\n\ndoc574656: One Foot in the Grave. Over the show's history, it featured a number of notable comic actors in one-off roles. These included Susie Blake, John Bird, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Peter Cook, Diana Coupland, Phil Daniels, Edward de Souza, Hannah Gordon, Georgina Hale, Jimmy Jewel, Rula Lenska, Stephen Lewis, Brian Murphy, Christopher Ryan, Barbara Windsor, Joan Sims and Ray Winstone. Two of Angus Deayton's former Radio Active and KYTV co-stars, Geoffrey Perkins and Michael Fenton Stevens were cast, in separate episodes, as respectively the brother and brother-in-law of Deayton's character. A few actors little-known at the time also appeared in one-off roles before going on to greater fame, including Lucy Davis, Joanna Scanlan, Eamonn Walker and Arabella Weir.\n\ndoc1531784: Things Aren't Simple Any More. \"Things Aren't Simple Any More\" is the final episode of the British television sitcom One Foot in the Grave. It was written by David Renwick and stars Richard Wilson as Victor Meldrew, Annette Crosbie as his wife Margaret, and features guest appearances by Hannah Gordon and Paul Merton. The episode depicts the death of the series' protagonist, Victor Meldrew, in a hit-and-run road accident, and his wife's efforts to deal with the driver who killed him. Renwick had been struggling to conceive and write new stories for the series and decided to kill off the character. The episode was filmed at Shawford, Hampshire, and at BBC Television Centre in London.[3]\n\ndoc574661: One Foot in the Grave. In 2004, One Foot in the Grave came tenth in a BBC poll to find \"Britain's Best Sitcom\" with 31,410 votes.[23] The programme also came 80th in the British Film Institute's 100 Greatest British Television Programmes [4]\n\ndoc486889: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes.

NOTE: Final appearances of Nick Swainey and Patrick and Pippa.\n\ndoc486893: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Ronnie and Cousin Wilfred.\n\ndoc574632: One Foot in the Grave. Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) \u2013 Victor is the main protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself constantly battling against all that life throws at him as he becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser.[11] From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after an automatic security system made him redundant at the office where he worked as a security guard, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor does not see himself as retired and is always trying to find another job, but all his attempts end in failure. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite fa\u00e7ade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. \"Victor-isms\" include \"I do not believe it!\", \"I don't believe it!\", \"Un-be-lievable!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?\", \"In the name of sanity!\". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassion\u2014in \"Hearts of Darkness\" he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in \"Descent Into The Maelstrom\" he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 42 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says \"You were always my first choice\", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode \"The Wisdom of the Witch\" in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, out of the window of the house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.\n\ndoc486888: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: This episode is considered to be the 1994 Christmas special.\n\ndoc486881: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Victor's famous catchphrase \"I don't believe it!\" is introduced in this episode.\n\ndoc486883: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Patrick and Pippa\n\ndoc574667: One Foot in the Grave. All six series and specials were initially available on BBC Worldwide VHS video tapes during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Comic Relief Shorts from 1993 and 2001 have not been released on DVD. A One Foot in the Grave Very Best Of DVD featuring five of the greatest episodes was released on 22 October 2001 in Region 2. Then on 8 July 2004, a One Foot in the Grave Very Best Of was also released in Region 4. Each series was gradually released on DVD in Region 2 between 2004 and 2006, with a complete series 1-6 box set towards the end of 2006. A slimmer series 1-6 box set was released in 2010 in Region 2.\n\ndoc574642: One Foot in the Grave. Pippa Trench (n\u00e9e Croker) (Janine Duvitski) \u2013 Patrick's wife sought friendly relations with the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men to make peace with each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home, thinking they were removal men who had initially come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a house clearance firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a \"gormless twerp\" on an answering machine message, unaware she was listening)\u00a0\u2013 for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one domino in his hand, and Victor had two pimples on his nose.\n\ndoc574666: One Foot in the Grave. Wilson dislikes saying his character's catchphrase (\"I don't believe it!\") and only performs the line for charity events for a small fee.[31] This became a joke in the actor's guest appearance as himself in the Father Ted episode \"The Mainland\", where Ted annoys him by constantly repeating his catchphrase. The situation was conceived when Father Ted writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews sat behind Wilson at a performance of Le Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall. They considered how \"tasteless and wrong\" it would be to lean forward to him every time that an acrobat did a stunt and yell the catchphrase, and then they realised that that's exactly what their fictional priests would do.[32] This was also played upon when Wilson made a guest appearance on the comedy TV quiz show Shooting Stars, in which Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer purposefully misquoted his catchphrase by referring to him as \"Richard 'I don't believe you' Wilson\".\n\ndoc574654: One Foot in the Grave. One Foot used Bournemouth to film some exterior sequences because of its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the house\u2014near Pokesdown, Bournemouth\u2014which had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed hands and the new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees that the previous owners had asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided to find a new house, and the first episode of the second series was rewritten to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire (this was filmed on waste ground in Northcote Road, Springbourne). This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.[14]\n\ndoc574651: One Foot in the Grave. Martin Trout (Peter Cook) - A paparazzo in \"One Foot in the Algarve\". He manages to take a number of compromising photographs, involving a high-ranking politician. Trout compares the potential impact of the photos to the Profumo affair. On his way to sell the images, he loses the roll of film whilst arguing at a phone box with the Meldrews and subsequently pursues them across the Algarve to retrieve it. He suffers a number of disasters both related and unrelated to Victor and Margaret's own misfortunes, only to find that the film had actually fallen into the lining of his jacket and had been with him for much of his journey. He lost it in the door of the Meldrews' car. Retrieving the roll after a brief spell in hospital, Trout attempts to leave the Algarve in a taxi but is involved in a car crash.\n\ndoc574629: One Foot in the Grave. Although set in a traditional suburban setting, the show subverts this genre with a strong overtone of black comedy. Series One's \"The Valley of Fear\" is an episode which caused controversy, when Victor finds a frozen cat in his freezer. Writer David Renwick also combined farce with elements of tragedy.[6] For example, in the final episode, Victor is killed by a hit-and-run driver, and although there is no explicit reference that Victor and Margaret had children, the episode \"Timeless Time\" contained a reference to someone named Stuart; the strong implication being that they once had a son who had died as a child.[5][7][8]\n\ndoc574644: One Foot in the Grave. Nick Swainey (Owen Brenman) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The excessively cheerful and often oblivious Mr Swainey appeared in the first episode, encouraging Victor to join his OAPs' trip to Eastbourne, and being greeted with Victor's trademark abuse. When the Meldrews move house, they discover he is their neighbour, living on the other side of the Meldrews from the Trenches. He remains continuously optimistic; even his being told to \"piss off\" by Victor is laughed off. Despite this run-in he later befriends Victor, and they frequently chat in their gardens, where Victor is often surprised by Mr Swainey's activities, ranging from archery and preparing amateur dramatics props, to bizarre games he arranges for his bedridden senile mother, whom the audience never actually see. Despite his cheery demeanour, he does occasionally drop his guard, once displaying apparent depression at being nothing more than \"an overgrown boy-scout\". Following his mother's death, he moved house near the end of the series, but only went as far as the Trenches'/McVitie's old house, claiming he'd always wanted to live in an \"end house, without leaving the area\". This took Victor by surprise; he did not learn where Mr Swainey was moving to until, while reminiscing in the garden about his departure, Mr Swainey suddenly appeared from the other side.\n\ndoc486891: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Only appearances of Derek and Betty McVitie. Features the song \"River Runs Deep\" performed by JJ Cale.\n\ndoc574665: One Foot in the Grave. Renwick integrated some of the plots and dialogue from the series into a novel, which was first published by BBC Books in 1992. Renwick also adapted four episodes for BBC Radio 2, which first aired between 21 January 1995 and 11 February 1995.[5] The episodes are \"Alive and Buried\", \"In Luton Airport, No One Can Hear You Scream\", \"Timeless Time\" and \"The Beast in the Cage\". They are regularly repeated on the digital speech station BBC Radio 4 Extra and are available on audio CD.\n\ndoc574645: One Foot in the Grave. Ronnie and Mildred (Gordon Peters and Barbara Ashcroft) \u2013 Ronnie and Mildred were a constantly cheerful, but incredibly boring, couple who provided yet another annoyance to the Meldrews, who dreaded any upcoming visits to them; Victor once said that he had hoped they were both dead. In \"The Worst Horror of All\", when the couple attempted a surprise visit, the Meldrews hid in their house to give the impression they were away on holiday, and then took the phone off the hook for several days afterwards, though these efforts to avoid them were in vain. They are referenced a number of times in the series for giving the Meldrews bizarre and always unwanted presents that are seldom opened, usually involving a garish photograph of themselves. In the final series, however it was clear that their cheerfulness was a fa\u00e7ade and, in a particularly dark scene, Mildred hanged herself \"during a game of Happy Families\". The shot of Mildred's feet dangling outside the window is usually cut from pre-watershed screenings.\n\ndoc574635: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret could be said to have a catchphrase - typically a long, exasperated use of the word \"God\", usually when making a realisation about the reasons behind one of Victor's mishaps. These are occasionally inadvertently aided by herself in some way, such as leaving the phone off the hook or giving permission to someone to enter the Meldrews' house when she isn't there.\n\ndoc486896: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: The song that's played over the ending of the episode is \"End of the Line\" by the Traveling Wilburys. In the US release of the DVD the song is replaced by stock music. The reason for this is presumably the music clearance rights were not granted for US viewers.\n\ndoc574657: One Foot in the Grave. The show was produced with an aspect ratio of 4:3 from 1990 to 1997. Three years later, the show returned to television for its final series, which was produced with an aspect ratio of 16:9. All episodes are of Standard Definition 576i.\n\ndoc574640: One Foot in the Grave. However, Patrick's rift with Victor eventually transforms him into a rather cynical character (much like Victor), and he often responds to him in similarly vindictive ways as a means of trying to settle the score. For example, writing complaints and grievances on post-it notes. This aspect of Patrick's character came to a head in the episode \"The Executioner's Song\" where his face temporarily morphs into that of Victor's as he looks into a mirror.\n\ndoc574662: One Foot in the Grave. A number of complaints were made during the series' run for its depiction of animal deaths. For example, in the episode \"The Valley of Fear\", a dead cat is found in the Meldrews' freezer; in another, a tortoise is roasted in a brazier. However, this was later cited as a positive feature of the programme's daring scripts in Britain's Best Sitcom by its advocate Rowland Rivron.[24] The programme was censured, however, for a scene in the episode \"Hearts of Darkness\" in which an elderly resident is abused in an old people's home, and following complaints, the scene was slightly cut when the episode was repeated.[25] In the DVD commentary for the episode, David Renwick stated his continued opposition to the cuts.[26] Another controversial scene in the episode \"Tales of Terror\" saw the Meldrews visit Ronnie and Mildred on the understanding that Mildred had gone upstairs during a game of Happy Families and not returned; Ronnie then shows her feet hanging outside of the window, revealing that she has committed suicide. The Broadcasting Standards Commission received complaints about this scene.[8]\n\ndoc574658: One Foot in the Grave. The One Foot in the Grave theme song was written, composed and sung by Eric Idle. A longer version was produced for the special \"One Foot in the Algarve\", released as a single with five remixes and a karaoke version in November 1994.[19] Idle included a live version of the song on his album Eric Idle Sings Monty Python.[20] It is preluded by a similar adaptation of \"Bread of Heaven\" to that used in the episode \"The Beast in the Cage\" by disgruntled car mechanics.[9][21] The title music on the TV series is accompanied at the beginning and end of each episode by footage of Galapagos tortoises. The series also made extensive use of incidental music, composed by Ed Welch, which often hinted at a particular genre to fit the mood of the scenes, frequently incorporating well-known pieces of music such as \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\" or Intermezzo from Jean Sibelius' Karelia Suite. In the Christmas special \"Endgame\" during Margaret's alleged death scene, a compilation of clips from past episodes are accompanied by the song \"River Runs Deep\" performed by J. J. Cale. The final episode ended with a montage of some of the mishaps Victor encountered, which were mentioned in the episode\u00a0\u2013 backed by \"End of the Line\" by the Traveling Wilburys.\n\ndoc1738127: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Wilson's biography, One Foot on the Stage: The Biography of Richard Wilson, was written by James Roose-Evans.[11]\n\ndoc574655: One Foot in the Grave. Since series two, the exterior scenes of the Meldrew's home were filmed at Tresillian Way, Walkford, near New Milton in Hampshire.[15] These later series make extensive use of specific street and garden locations in most episodes, particularly for scenes involving the Meldrew's neighbours.[16] Most outside locations were filmed in and around Bournemouth and Christchurch. These include Richmond Hill, Undercliff Drive and Boscombe Pier, Bournemouth Town Hall, Lansdowne College, Christchurch Hospital and the former Royal Victoria Hospital (Boscombe). Later episodes, such as \"Hearts of Darkness\", were filmed entirely on location. Victor's death by a hit and run driver in the final episode was filmed at Shawford railway station, Hampshire. Fans left floral tributes at the site.[17][18]\n\ndoc614653: Jonathan Creek. Others who were tried for the part included Nigel Planer (who would later guest star) and Angus Deayton (who had previously worked with Renwick and director Susan Belbin on One Foot in the Grave). Almost a dozen actors were considered before Susan Belbin saw Alan Davies during a rehearsal for a sitcom. Davies was invited round to talk to Renwick and \"turned up in his duffle coat with straggly hair and a broad grin [and] was self-evidently the closest match yet to Creek as we had always seen him\".[9]\n\ndoc574646: One Foot in the Grave. Alfred Meldrew (Richard Pearson) - Victor's absent-minded brother, who lives in New Zealand. During the episode \"The Broken Reflection\", he comes to visit after 25 years, to the disdain of Victor. Alfred is an eccentric character, often walking around with his hat on fire, and bringing over his and Victor's great-grandfather's skull. He is a clumsy character too, mistaking the table-cloth for a napkin and dropping the entire contents of the table all over the floor when he stands up, and breaking a mirror in the middle of the night after mistaking his own reflection for a burglar. Victor starts to warm to Alfred towards the end of his visit, but Alfred leaves early the next day after finding an unpleasant message about him that Victor had accidentally recorded on a dictaphone. He is not seen again, but keeps in touch with the Meldrews, as Victor is seen looking at some photographs Alfred had sent over in \"The Trial\".\n\ndoc1738130: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Wilson was a supporter of his local football club, Greenock Morton, but he has come to lend greater support to English club Manchester United.[14] He is a patron of the Manchester United Supporters Trust.[15] Wilson has been a campaigner for gay rights for many years,[16] and he came out as gay in a Daily Mail interview in March 2013.[17] Wilson is good friends with his One Foot in the Grave co-star Angus Deayton, and is godfather to Deayton's son.[18]\n\ndoc574648: One Foot in the Grave. Great Aunt Joyce and Uncle Dick - Unseen characters, they are often mentioned by Victor and Margaret, as an aging and grim couple and Victor and Margaret dread having anything to do with them. Great Aunt Joyce is mentioned as having a glass eye and has the habit of knitting bizarre items (such as six-fingered gloves) for Victor. Uncle Dick has a wooden arm; in the final Comic Relief (2001) episode, it transpires that a nurse had mistakenly placed a drip in the false arm for 18 hours after a trip to hospital after trying to remove a kidney stone with a wire coat hanger.\n\ndoc1382830: Barefoot in the Park (film). Barefoot in the Park is a 1967 American comedy film starring Jane Fonda as Corie, and Robert Redford as Paul.\n\ndoc1531803: Things Aren't Simple Any More. Salmon agreed not to broadcast the episode at Christmas.[3] It was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000,[2] forty minutes in length, rather than usual thirty. The episode's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don't Believe It! The One Foot In The Grave Story, a documentary presented by Angus Deayton which looked back at the hit sitcom.[23] The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release.\n\ndoc119098: Prince Hamlet. Although, the difference between a sexton and a grave digger must also be taken into account. A sexton oversees many different jobs around the church and surrounding areas. A grave digger simply digs graves. There are sextons who also dig graves and some that do not. It is completely possible that the Gravedigger has been a sexton for 30 years, but has not been digging graves for that entire time. This could be another example of the character's very round-about way of speaking.\n\ndoc2563632: List of Hotel Transylvania characters. In Good Night Mr. Foot, one Witch (voiced by Rose Abdoo) was shown bothering Bigfoot which ended with a pillow fight.\n\ndoc2089054: The Gravediggers. The Second Gravedigger exits as Hamlet and Horatio enter, and the First Gravedigger begins to sing a song on the topics of love and graves as he digs. He throws a skull (and later a second) up and out of the grave. Hamlet then talks to Horatio about how inappropriate it is to treat what used to be someone's, and possibly an important someone's, body in such a way. He decides to ask the Gravedigger whose grave he is digging, but the Gravedigger will not reveal the answer without another witty exchange.\n\ndoc1382837: Barefoot in the Park (film). The next day, Paul comes home with a fever, but Corie still insists she wants a divorce. The two spend an awkward time together in their apartment before Corie kicks Paul out. She then gets a call from her aunt, saying that Ethel did not come home. Corie panics, and eventually finds out that her mother was at Victor's apartment. While Victor was escorting her to her home in New Jersey the previous night, Ethel slipped on icy stairs and fell. Victor and some neighbors took her back to Victor's apartment, where they spent the night. Strangely, Ethel was wearing nothing but her undergarments and Victor's Japanese kimono. It turned out that Victor had Ethel's dress drycleaned.\n\ndoc574641: One Foot in the Grave. It is mentioned several times that Patrick would like to have children. After Pippa miscarries and Patrick is, so he claims, rendered infertile by a freak accident (for which he unfairly blames Victor), he adopts a dachshund called Denzil, which Pippa describes as his \"baby substitute\". Denzil frequently appears with Patrick through series 3-5. Despite their animosity towards each other, Victor ends up saving Patrick's life in \"The Wisdom of the Witch\".\n\ndoc574634: One Foot in the Grave. In later episodes, Margaret develops into a more complex character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode \"Hole in the Sky\", eventually leading her to destroy it. In \"The Affair of the Hollow Lady\", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops a soft spot for Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode \"Warm Champagne\". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, \"He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen.\" She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in \"Things aren't simple anymore\" where she voices that the world is \"all speed and greed\" and that \"nobody does anything about anything\". In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, \"shared their bodies\" in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had \"grabbed hold of the wrong person\". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies; one day when she opened the door of their cage, one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself, while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud in front of the whole class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.\n\ndoc652931: Brenda Fricker. Brenda Fricker (born 17 February 1945) is an Irish actress of theatre, film and television. She has appeared in more than 30 films and television roles. In 1989, she became the first Irish actress to win an Oscar, earning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for My Left Foot. As of July 2014, she has tentatively retired from acting.[1]\n\ndoc953243: Finding Your Feet. \u2018Lady\u2019 Sandra Abbott (Imelda Staunton) discovers that her husband of forty years (John Sessions) is having an affair with her best friend (Josie Lawrence), she seeks refuge in London with her estranged, older sister Bif (Celia Imrie). Sandra is a fish out of water next to her outspoken, serial dating, free spirited sibling who lives on an inner-city council estate.[3] But difference is just what Sandra needs and she reluctantly lets Bif drag her along to a community dance class where she meets her sister's friends, Charlie (Timothy Spall), Jackie (Joanna Lumley) and Ted (David Hayman). This colorful group of defiant and energetic third-agers start to show Sandra that retirement is a beginning, and that divorce could be her new lease of life and love.\n\ndoc2648014: Chuck Woolery. As an actor, he has appeared with Stephen Boyd, Rosey Grier and Cheryl Ladd in the mid-1970s film Evil in the Deep.[5] He appeared as himself in the 1989 film Cold Feet that starred Keith Carradine and Rip Torn.[6]\n\ndoc1080421: Siobhan Finneran. In 2017, she played Nikki Kirkbright in ITV's Cold Feet.\n\ndoc2631278: Talk:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?/Archive 1. Chris Tarrant is on record as saying that the clash of Judith Keppel's show with the episode of One Foot In The Grave where Victor dies was just sheer coincidence.\n\ndoc574663: One Foot in the Grave. When the final episode, \"Things Aren't Simple Any More\" originally aired on 20 November 2000 at 9pm, it coincided with the broadcast of the first jackpot winner in the UK version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, which had been filmed the Sunday before the broadcast. ITV was accused of engineering this in order to damage the final episode's expected high ratings, but was later cleared by the Independent Television Commission.[27]\n\ndoc953249: Finding Your Feet. Australian film critic Stephen Romei of The Australian awarded the film 4 stars and said \"Finding Your Feet is rightly billed as comedy-drama; yet, although it\u2019s full of rib-tickling dialogue, it\u2019s the drama that cuts deep\".[14] Mark Kermode reviewed the film favourably on BBC Radio 5 Live.[15] Kevin Maher from The Times said it was \"oddly adorable\".[16] Andy Lea of The Sunday Express awarded the film 4 stars and said \"it\u2019s big-hearted, touching, smartly-written and beautifully performed by a hugely talented cast\".[17] Allan Hunter said in The Daily Express that it was \"a sentimental tearjerker elevated by a top-notch British cast\".[18] Linda Marric from HeyUGuys said the film was \"a charming, oft-told tale of second chances in life and love, filled with fine performances.\"[19] Francesca Rudkin of The New Zealand Herald compared Finding Your Feet to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Calendar Girls and said the film was a charming, if somewhat predictable, crowd-pleaser about embracing life in your later years.[20] Emma Simmonds from The List said \"the joie de vivre of these convention-defying pensioners is ultimately irresistible.\"[21] Louise Keller from Urban Cinefile said \"Finding Your Feet may be predictable fare, but it has a heart of solid gold\".[22] James Mottram from Total Film said \"Its love-in-later-life insights are well-worn, but with Staunton on song, Richard Loncraine's film mines genuine feeling\". In another positive review, The Film Blog called Finding Your Feet \"A Billy Elliot for Seniors with a meaningful slice of warmth and humour\".[23]\n\ndoc1846781: Joan Sims. She played Mrs Wembley in the BBC comedy series On the Up, which starred Dennis Waterman and ran from 1990 to 1992. From 1994, she played Madge Hardcastle, drum playing wife to Rocky Hardcastle played by Frank Middlemass, and stepmother of Geoffrey Palmer's character Lionel in As Time Goes By. Sims also appeared in episodes of the hit television comedy series Only Fools and Horses, the 1987 Christmas Day special The Frog's Legacy, and The Goodies, in the One Foot in the Grave special One Foot in the Algarve, and made a guest appearance in a sketch show with Victoria Wood.\n\ndoc2089059: The Gravediggers. And later in the scene:\n\ndoc2089074: The Gravediggers. In most of the movie adaptations of Hamlet, the part of the First Gravedigger (and at times the Second Gravedigger) is played by an extremely established actor or comedian. The following are the actors that portrayed the Gravedigger in the most notable cinematic productions:\n\ndoc1214992: Sonequa Martin-Green. While known primarily for her television roles, Sonequa Martin-Green made her debut in film with various film roles since 2005. In 2009, she played the lead role of Tosha Spinner in Toe to Toe opposite Louisa Krause, the fiercely determined scholarship student who seeks to build a brighter future outside of Anacostia and away from one of Washington's poorest neighborhoods. The film focuses on her friendship and rivalry with Jessie (Louisa Krause), a privileged girl from Bethesda whose promiscuous tendencies threaten to become her undoing. They both strive to gain a better understanding of one another's plight as society threatens to drive them ever farther apart. The film received generally positive reviews, with Martin-Green's performance receiving critical acclaim,[10][11] even from the film's detractors.[12][13]\n\ndoc861721: Barefoot in the Park. A production of Barefoot in the Park ran at the Moore Theater  in Seattle for one week in late 1981, which was taped for a made-for-TV movie by HBO.[6][7] The play\u2014and movie\u2014starred Richard Thomas as Paul, Bess Armstrong as Corie, Barbara Barrie as Mrs. Banks, and Hans Conried as Velasco.[8][9] It was initially telecast in March 1982. The reviewer for UPI wrote: \"Richard Thomas\u2014light years removed from the John Boy image of his youth\u2014is superb as Paul Bratter, the buttoned-down young lawyer struggling to come to terms with the elfin free spirit with whom he finds himself honeymooning. Bess Armstrong glows in the role of his wife, Corrie, but Barbara Barrie virtually walks away with the show as her bemused mother.\"[10]\n\ndoc1382835: Barefoot in the Park (film). Corie (Jane Fonda), a free spirited young woman, and Paul Bratter (Robert Redford), a conservative, less free-spirited man, are a recently married couple, who move into a fifth floor apartment in Greenwich Village (one of the ongoing jokes is the fact that everyone has to climb so many stairs to get to the apartment). Corie decorates the small, leaky apartment, turning it into a picturesque little home for the two. One of the many odd people living in the apartment building, the quirky Victor Velasco (Charles Boyer), befriends Corie, even flirting with her. He lives in the attic of the building, and climbs through the Bratters' apartment window to get to his. Victor helps Corie with the apartment, teaching her how to work the seemingly broken heating and plumbing.\n\ndoc2563688: List of Dad's Army characters. Played by Arnold Ridley, Godfrey was the most frail member of the platoon, and was the platoon's medical orderly. He had served in the First World War as a conscientious-objecting stretcher bearer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, winning the Military Medal before becoming a tailor at the Army & Navy Stores. Godfrey was an amiable, vague, lifelong bachelor who lived with his sisters in an idyllic cottage, and was a martyr to his weak bladder, leading to many requests to be \"excused\". He was very loyal to Captain Mainwaring, except on one occasion when he took part in a plot to make Mainwaring's feet hurt.\n\ndoc1584351: Rise of the Footsoldier. In America, Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever also disliked it, throwing the film one bone (out of possible four) and dismissing it as \"Brit crime flick, based on a true story, that has nothing going for it but violence\". Indicating that \"Carlton Leach goes from football hooligan in the 1980s to criminal muscle and gangster in the 1990s\", the write-up ends with mention of \"three murdered drug dealers who were found in rural Essex\".\n\ndoc1849258: One Foot (Walk the Moon song). \"One Foot\" is a song by American rock band Walk the Moon for their third studio album, What If Nothing (2017). The song was released as the album's lead single on September 22, 2017.[1]\n\ndoc488167: List of Bones characters. A former FBI special agent, he made his career writing a book about the serial killer known as the Gravedigger before he was killed by Heather Taffet, the Gravedigger herself.\n\n"
