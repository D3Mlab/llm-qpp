Dr. Jesse Bennett (July 10, 1769 \u00e2\u20ac\u201dJuly 13, 1842) was the first American physician to perform a successful Caesarean section, which he performed on his own wife at the birth of their only child on January 14, 1794.[1][2]\n\ndoc515885: Caesarean section. The first successful Caesarean section to be performed in America took place in Mason County, Virginia (now Mason County, West Virginia), in 1794. The procedure was performed by Dr. Jesse Bennett on his wife Elizabeth.[103]\n\ndoc740113: Committee of Public Safety. July 1793 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c July 1794:\n\ndoc1427: Jesse Bennett. Because Dr. Bennett didn't report the operation during his life, it was long believed the first successful American Caesarian section had been performed in 1827 by Dr. John Lambert in Ohio. Dr. Lambert lived only ten miles from Dr. Bennett's practice.[3]\n\ndoc725527: Timeline of the French Revolution.

Stage of the Festival of the Supreme Being (June 8, 1794)\n\ndoc662326: Timeline of labor issues and events. 1794 (United States)\n\ndoc515888: Caesarean section. The Roman Lex Regia (royal law), later the Lex Caesarea (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715\u00e2\u20ac\u201c673 BC),[106] required the child of a mother dead in childbirth to be cut from her womb.[107] There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant,[108] that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.[109] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false.[110] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.[107][111] As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.[112] The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere, \"to cut\", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones. Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, \"cut from the womb\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \"Caesar\" which was then carried by his descendants.[107] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as \"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\".[113] Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar\"[114]\n\ndoc725526: Timeline of the French Revolution. The Convention rises against Robespierre (July 27, 1794)\n\ndoc740095: Committee of Public Safety. The execution of Robespierre in July 1794 represented a reactionary period against the Committee of Public Safety. This is known as the Thermidorian Reaction, as Robespierre's fall from power occurred during the Revolutionary month of Thermidor. The Committee's influence diminished,[1] and it was disestablished in 1795.\n\ndoc1430709: Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution. Festival of the Supreme Being, 8 June 1794.\n\ndoc515886: Caesarean section. On March 5, 2000, in Mexico, In\u00e9s Ram\u00edrez performed a Caesarean section on herself and survived, as did her son, Orlando Ruiz Ram\u00edrez.[104]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc740103: Committee of Public Safety. The elimination of the H\u00e9bertists and the Dantonists made evident the strength of the committees, as had their ability to control and silence opposition. The creation, in March 1794, of a \"General Police Bureau\"\u2014reporting nominally to the Committee of Public Safety, but more often directly to Robespierre and his closest ally, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just\u2014served to increase the power of the Committee of Public Safety, and of Robespierre himself.\n\ndoc2262687: United States Capitol cornerstone laying. A centennial rededication of the Capitol, roughly modeled after the cornerstone ceremony of 1793, was organized on September 18, 1893.[12] The pre-ceremonial parade proceeded along the same route followed by Washington's entourage in 1793 and was led by President Grover Cleveland, who rode in the presidential state coach accompanied by a squadron of United States Army cavalry. The president was followed by a ceremonial escort formed into four divisions.[13] The first division consisted of delegations from Masonic lodges and friendly societies. The second division was formed of contingents from lineage societies, including the Society of the Cincinnati, the Sons of the Revolution, and the Aztec Club of 1847. The third division included federal military forces, including units from the U.S. Army 3rd Field Artillery Regiment and the District of Columbia National Guard. The fourth division consisted of local fire brigades.[13] At the capitol, the United States Marine Band provided music, accompanied by a 1,500-person choir. Opening remarks were delivered by Cleveland, followed by a two-hour speech by William Wirt Henry, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and Patrick Henry's grandson.[1] According to news reports of the day, 150,000 spectators attended the event.[1][13]\n\ndoc740102: Committee of Public Safety. Consequently, though the H\u00e9bertists were arrested and executed in March 1794, the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security ensured that Desmoulins and Danton were also arrested. H\u00e9rault de S\u00e9chelles\u2014a friend and ally of Danton\u2014was expelled from the Committee of Public Safety, arrested, and tried alongside them. On 5 April 1794, the Dantonists went to the guillotine.[8]\n\ndoc2426479: Concierto de Aranjuez. On 11 December 1940 the concerto received its first performance in Madrid, at the Teatro Espa\u00f1ol de Madrid conducted by Jes\u00fas Ar\u00e1mbarri, with the same soloist. The United States premiere was given by Rey de la Torre on 19 November 1959, with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Robert Shaw.\n\ndoc740107: Committee of Public Safety. On the following day, 27 July 1794 (or 9 Thermidor according to the Revolutionary calendar), Saint-Just began to deliver a speech to the Convention in which he had planned to denounce Collot d'Herbois, Billaud-Varenne, and other members of the Committee of Public Safety. However, he was almost immediately interrupted by Tallien and by Billaud-Varenne, who accused Saint-Just of intending to \"murder the Convention.\"[13] Bar\u00e8re, Vadier, and Stanislas Fr\u00e9ron joined the accusations against Saint-Just and Robespierre. The arrest of Robespierre, his brother Augustin, and Saint-Just was ordered, along with that of their supporters, Philippe Le Bas and Georges Couthon.\n\ndoc113600: French First Republic. As a result of the spike in public violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, a party of six members of France's Legislative Assembly was assigned the task of overseeing elections. The resulting Convention was founded with the dual purpose of abolishing the monarchy and drafting a new constitution. The Convention's first act, on 10 August 1792, was to establish the French First Republic and officially strip the king of all political powers. The King, by then a private citizen bearing his family name of Capet, was subsequently put on trial for crimes of high treason starting in December 1792. On 16 January 1793 he was convicted, and on 21 January, he was executed by guillotine.[4]\n\ndoc463814: National Convention. Although the Convention lasted until 1795, power was effectively stripped from the elected deputies and concentrated in the small Committee of Public Safety from April 1793. The eight months from Fall 1793 to Spring 1794, when Maximilien Robespierre and his allies dominated the Committee of Public Safety, represent the most radical and bloodiest phase of the French Revolution, known as the Reign of Terror. After the fall of Robespierre, the Convention lasted for another year until a new constitution was written, ushering in the French Directory.\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515880: Caesarean section. Pliny the Elder theorized that Julius Caesar's name came from an ancestor who was born by caesarean section, but the truth of this is debated (see the discussion of the etymology of Caesar). The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by caesarean section. His first wife however died in childbirth, giving birth to a stilborn son who might have lived had a caesarean taken place.\n\ndoc515891: Caesarean section. Finally, the Roman praenomen (given name) Caeso was said to be given to children who were born via C-section. While this was probably just folk etymology made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.[117]\n\ndoc740106: Committee of Public Safety. When it became evident, in mid-July 1794, that Robespierre and Saint-Just were planning to strike against their political opponents Joseph Fouch\u00e9, Jean-Lambert Tallien, and Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier (the latter two of whom were members of the Committee of General Security), the fragile truce within the government was dissolved. Saint-Just and his fellow Committee of Public Safety member Bar\u00e8re attempted to keep the peace between the Committees of Public Safety and General Security; however, on 26 July, Robespierre delivered a speech to the National Convention in which he emphasized the need to \"purify\" the Committees and \"crush all factions.\"[12] In a speech to the Jacobin Club that night, he attacked Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, who had refused to allow the printing and distribution of his speech to the Convention.\n\ndoc515884: Caesarean section. European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc65238: French Revolution. Maximilien Robespierre, since July 1793 member of the Committee of Public Prosperity,[130] on 5 February 1794 in a speech in the Convention identified Jacques H\u00e9bert and his faction as \"internal enemies\" working toward the triumph of tyranny.[135] After a dubious trial H\u00e9bert and some allies, charged with counter-revolutionary activities,[152] were guillotined in March.[135]\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc515871: Caesarean section. In the United States C-section rates have increased from just over 20% in 1996 to 33% in 2011.[3] This increase has not resulted in improved outcomes resulting in the position that C-sections may be done too frequently.[3]\n\ndoc515811: Caesarean section. C-sections result in a small overall increase in poor outcomes in low risk pregnancies.[3] They also typically take longer to heal from, about six weeks, than vaginal birth.[2] The increased risks include breathing problems in the baby and amniotic fluid embolism and postpartum bleeding in the mother.[3] Established guidelines recommend that caesarean sections not be used before 39 weeks of pregnancy without a medical reason.[6] The method of delivery does not appear to have an effect on subsequent sexual function.[7]\n\ndoc298280: French Constitution of 1791. A twelve-member Constitutional Committee was convened on 14 July 1789 (coincidentally the day of the Storming of the Bastille). Its task was to do much of the drafting of the articles of the constitution. It included originally two members from the First Estate (Champion de Cic\u00e9, Archbishop of Bordeaux and Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun); two from the Second (the comte de Clermont-Tonnerre and the marquis de Lally-Tollendal); and four from the Third (Jean Joseph Mounier, Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s, Nicholas Bergasse, and Isaac Ren\u00e9 Guy le Chapelier).\n\ndoc463876: National Convention. On the evening of 10 Thermidor (28 July 1794), Robespierre, Saint-Just, Couthon and nineteen of their political allies were executed without trial. On the following day it was the turn of a large batch of 71 men, the largest mass execution in the entire course of the Revolution.[64]\n\ndoc1133960: French Directory. On 27 July 1794, members of the French Convention, the revolutionary parliament of France, rose up against its leader, Maximilien Robespierre, who was in the midst of executing thousands of suspected enemies of the Revolution. Robespierre and his leading followers were declared outside the law, and on 28 July were arrested and guillotined the same day. The Revolutionary Tribunal, which had sent thousands to the guillotine, ceased meeting and its head, Fouquier-Tinville, was arrested and imprisoned, and after trial was himself guillotined. More than five hundred suspected counter-revolutionaries awaiting trial and execution were immediately released.\n\ndoc740112: Committee of Public Safety. April 1793 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c July 1793:\n\ndoc740094: Committee of Public Safety. In July 1793, following the defeat at the Convention of the Girondins, the prominent leader of the radical Jacobin, Maximilien Robespierre, was added to the Committee. The power of the Committee peaked between August 1793 and July 1794. In December 1793, the Convention formally conferred executive power upon the Committee.\n\ndoc1405576: The Lamb. Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy C, 1789, 1794 (Library of Congress), object 8 \"The Lamb\"\n\ndoc491904: Jacobin. In late June 1794, three colleagues on the Committee of Public Prosperity/Safety \u2013 Billaud-Varenne, Collot d'Herbois and Carnot \u2013 called Robespierre a dictator. Late July 1794, Robespierre and 21 associates including the Jacobin Saint-Just and the Montagnard Couthon were sentenced to death by the National Convention and guillotined.[22]\n\ndoc740098: Committee of Public Safety. The Committee was formally created on 6 April 1793. Closely associated with the leadership of Danton, it was initially known as \"the Danton Committee\".[3] Danton steered the Committee through the 31 May and 2 June 1793 journ\u00e9es that resulted in the fall of the Girondins, and through the intensifying war in the Vend\u00e9e. However, when the Committee was recomposed on 10 July, Danton was not included. Nevertheless, he continued to support the centralization of power by the Committee.[4]\n\ndoc6307: Music history of the United States during the colonial era. The English singer Benjamin Carr was especially notable. He arrived in New York in 1793, along with his brother and father. They soon became prominent music publishers and vendors, owning stores in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Carr himself was a composer, organist, pianist and a publisher and editor. They published, in Philadelphia, \"The President's March\" in 1793; written by Philip Phile, \"The President's March\" is one of the most enduring of American patriotic songs. The march was soon politicized, adopted by the Federalists as a rallying song.\n\ndoc515853: Caesarean section. The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of Misgav Ladach, a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al in 1994[52] and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. However, there is an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.[53][54]\n\ndoc2034118: 1793 in the United States. Events from the year 1793 in the United States.\n\ndoc515813: Caesarean section. Caesarean section is recommended when vaginal delivery might pose a risk to the mother or baby. C-sections are also carried out for personal and social reasons. Systematic reviews have found no strong evidence about the impact of caesareans for non-medical reasons.[10][11] Recommendations encourage counseling to identify the reasons for the request, addressing anxieties and information, and encouraging vaginal birth.[10][12] Elective caesareans at 38 weeks showed increased health complications in the newborn.[13] For this reason, planned caesarean sections (also known as elective caesarean sections) should not be scheduled before 39 weeks gestation unless there is medical reason to do so.\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc725520: Timeline of the French Revolution. The execution of Louis XVI (January 21, 1793)\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc1962854: Mount Vernon Conference. This second interstate political convention, formally titled \"A Meeting of Commissioners to Remedy Defects of the Federal Government\", convened at George Mann's Tavern[7] held in Annapolis, Maryland, on September 11, 1786,. Delegates from five states (appointed delegates from four others either arrived too late to participate or otherwise did not attend) gathered to discuss ways to facilitate commerce between the states and establish standard rules and regulations. As a result of the gathering, commissioners called for there to be another constitutional convention at which possible improvements to the Articles could be discussed. The desired convention took place in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.\n\ndoc2107804: Confederation Period. In 1785, Washington hosted the Mount Vernon Conference, which established an agreement between Maryland and Virginia regarding several commercial issues. Encouraged by this example of interstate cooperation, Madison convinced the Virginia assembly to host another conference, the Annapolis Convention, with the goal of promoting interstate trade.[101] Only five state delegations attended the convention, but the delegates that did attend largely agreed on the need to reform the federal government. The delegates called for a second convention to take place in 1787 in Philadelphia to consider constitutional reform. In the months after the Annapolis Convention, reformers took steps to ensure better turnout at the next convention. They secured the blessing of Congress to consider constitutional reform and made sure to invite Washington, the most prominent national leader. The nationalist call for a constitutional convention was bolstered by the outbreak of Shays' Rebellion, which convinced many of the need for a national government powerful enough to help suppress uprisings.[102]\n\ndoc1279053: History of France. In the Convention session of 27 July 1794, Robespierre and his allies hardly managed to say a word as they were constantly interrupted by a row of critics such as Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, Vadier, Bar\u00c3\u00a8re and acting president Thuriot. Finally, even Robespierre's own voice failed on him: it faltered at his last attempt to beg permission to speak. A decree was adopted to arrest Robespierre, Saint-Just and Couthon. 28 July, they and 19 others were beheaded. 29 July, again 70 Parisians were guillotined.[68] Subsequently, the Law of 22 Prairial (10 June 1794) was repealed, and the 'Girondins' expelled from the Convention in June 1793, if not dead yet, were reinstated as Convention deputies.[74]\n\ndoc432255: History of Europe. On 20 September 1792 the National Convention abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of war, the National Convention created the Committee of Public Safety, controlled by Maximilien de Robespierre of the Jacobin Club, to act as the country's executive. Under Robespierre, the committee initiated the Reign of Terror, during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles and those convicted by the Revolutionary Tribunal, often on the flimsiest of evidence. Internal tensions at Paris drove the Committee towards increasing assertions of radicalism and increasing suspicions, fueling new terror: A few months into this phase, more and more prominent revolutionaries were being sent to the guillotine by Robespierre and his faction, for example Madame Roland and Georges Danton. Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary insurrections were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the coup of 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794) and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierre's more extreme policies.\n\ndoc16518: Left\u2013right political spectrum. When the National Assembly was replaced in 1791 by a Legislative Assembly comprising entirely new members, the divisions continued. \"Innovators\" sat on the left, \"moderates\" gathered in the centre, while the \"conscientious defenders of the constitution\" found themselves sitting on the right, where the defenders of the Ancien R\u00e9gime had previously gathered.[clarification needed] When the succeeding National Convention met in 1792, the seating arrangement continued, but following the coup d'\u00e9tat of 2 June 1793 and the arrest of the Girondins the right side of the assembly was deserted and any remaining members who had sat there moved to the centre. However, following the Thermidorian Reaction of 1794 the members of the far-left were excluded and the method of seating was abolished. The new constitution included rules for the assembly that would \"break up the party groups\".[6] However, following the Restoration in 1814\u20131815 political clubs were again formed. The majority ultraroyalists chose to sit on the right. The \"constitutionals\" sat in the centre while independents sat on the left. The terms extreme right and extreme left as well as centre-right and centre-left came to be used to describe the nuances of ideology of different sections of the assembly.[7]\n\ndoc71142: Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The first congressional terms to begin under Section 1 were those of the 74th Congress, on January 3, 1935. The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin under Section 1 were the second terms of President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner, on January 20, 1937.\n\ndoc2002958: France. Political disagreements and enmity in the National Convention between October 1793 and July 1794 reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were going prosperous, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and from royalism.\n\ndoc1596640: Maximilien Robespierre. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Maximilien Robespierre, 1794[57]\n\ndoc1648427: Coronation of the British monarch. In early modern coronations, the events inside the abbey were usually recorded by artists and published in elaborate folio books of engravings,[30] the last of these was published in 1905 depicting the coronation which had taken place three years earlier.[31] Re-enactments of the ceremony were staged at London and provincial theatres; in 1761, a production featuring the Westminster Abbey choir at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden ran for three months after the real event.[30] In 1902, a request to record the ceremony on a gramophone record was rejected, but Sir\u00a0Benjamin Stone photographed the procession into the abbey.[31] Nine years later, at the coronation of George\u00a0V, Stone was allowed to photograph the recognition, the presentation of the swords, and the homage.[32]\n\ndoc177586: Voltaire. On 11 July 1791, he was enshrined in the Panth\u00e9on, after the National Assembly of France, which regarded him as a forerunner of the French Revolution, had his remains brought back to Paris.[101] It is estimated that a million people attended the procession, which stretched throughout Paris. There was an elaborate ceremony, complete with an orchestra, and the music included a piece that Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try had composed especially for the event, which included a part for the \"tuba curva\" (an instrument that originated in Roman times as the cornu but had recently been revived under a new name[102]).\n\ndoc650944: 1st United States Congress. Held December 6, 1790, through March 3, 1791, at Congress Hall in Philadelphia\n\ndoc65241: French Revolution. Meanwhile, France's external wars were going well, with victories over Austrian and British troops in May and June 1794 opening up Belgium for French conquest.[135] But cooperation within the Committee of Public Prosperity, since April 1793 the de facto executive government, started to break down. On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at 'the Committee' called him a dictator in his face \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should have the courage to say which deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, what Robespierre refused to do.[135]\n\ndoc298285: French Constitution of 1791. A second body, the Committee of Revisions, was struck September 1790, and included Antoine Barnave, Adrien Duport, and Charles de Lameth. Because the National Assembly was both a legislature and a constitutional convention, it was not always clear when its decrees were constitutional articles or mere statutes. It was the job of this committee to sort it out. The committee became very important in the days after the Champs de Mars Massacre, when a wave of revulsion against popular movements swept France and resulted in a renewed effort to preserve powers for the Crown. The result is the rise of the Feuillants, a new political faction led by Barnave, who used his position on the committee to preserve a number of powers for the Crown, such as the nomination of ambassadors, military leaders, and ministers.\n\ndoc1596638: Maximilien Robespierre. From 13 February to 13 March 1794, Robespierre withdrew from active business on the Committee due to illness. On 15 March, he reappeared in the Convention. H\u00c3\u00a9bert and nineteen of his followers were arrested on 19 March and guillotined on 24 March. Danton, Desmoulins and their friends were arrested on 30 March and guillotined on 5 April.\n\ndoc779285: Reign of Terror. Several historians consider the \"reign of terror\" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September,[1] June[2] or March (birth of the Revolutionary Tribunal), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 (September Massacres), or even July 1789 (when the first lynchings took place),[3] but there is a consensus that it ended with the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794.[1][2]\n\ndoc491874: Jacobin. In July 1794, the government of Robespierre and allies was pushed out of power; Robespierre and 21 associates were executed. In November 1794, the Jacobin Club was closed.\n\ndoc515887: Caesarean section. The patron saint of Caesarean section is Caesarius of Africa, a young deacon martyred at Terracina, who has replaced and Christianized the pagan figure of Caesar.[105] The martyr (Saint Cesareo, in italian) is invoked for the good success of this surgical procedure.\n\ndoc463864: National Convention. But at the end of the winter of 1793-4, the shortage of food took a sharp turn for the worse. The Hebertists incited sans-culottes to demand stringent measures, and at first the Committee did prove conciliatory. The Convention voted 10 million for relief,[clarification needed] on 3 Ventose, Barere presented a new general Maximum, and on the 8th Saint-Just obtained a decree confiscating the property of suspects and distributing it to the needy (Ventose decrees). The Hebertists felt that if they increased the pressure, they would triumph once and for all. Although the call appeared like one for insurrection it was probably just for a new demonstration, like the one in September. But the Committee of Public Safety decided on 22 Ventose Year II (12 March 1794) that the Hebertists posed too serious a threat. The Committee linked Hebert, Ronsin, Vincent, and Momoro to the emigres Proli, Cloots and Pereira, so as to present the Hebertists as parties to the \"foreign plot\". All were executed on 4 Germinal (24 March).[48] This move largely silenced the Hebertists, now without their leadership. Having succeeded in stifling dissent on the left, the Committee then turned on the Dantonists, several members of which were implicated in financial corruption. The Committee forced the Convention to lift the parliamentary immunity of nine Dantonist deputies, allowing them to be put on trial. On 5 April Dantonist leaders Danton, Delacroix, Desmoulins, and Philippeaux were executed.[49]\n\ndoc2563488: Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. On hearing of Mountbatten's death, the then Master of the Queen's Music, Malcolm Williamson, was moved to write the Lament in Memory of Lord Mountbatten of Burma for violin and string orchestra. The 11\u00c2\u00a0minute work was given its first performance on 5 May 1980 by the Scottish Baroque Ensemble, conducted by Leonard Friedman.[126]\n\ndoc1728837: America's Critical Period.

After the 1760s, regular concerts became a part of the cultural landscape, as well as a wide variety of dancing. Operatic excerpts began to appear, and before the end of the century Canada had its first home-grown opera.[4] A \"Concert Hall\" existed in Qu\u00e9bec by 1764 and subscription concerts by 1770, given, one may presume, by band players and skilled amateurs.[26] Programs for the Qu\u00e9bec and Halifax concerts of the 1790s reveal orchestral and chamber music by Handel, J.C. Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Pleyel.[5] Canada's first two operas were written, ca. 1790 and ca. 1808 by composer, poet, and playwright Joseph Quesnel (1746\u20131809).[27] The instrument of favour for the lower class was the fiddle. Fiddlers were a fixture in most public drinking establishments.[28] God Save the King/Queen has been sung in Canada since British rule and by the mid-20th century was, along with \"O Canada\", one of the country's two de facto national anthems.[29][30][31][32]\n\ndoc515895: Caesarean section. Self-inflicted caesarean section is the concept of a mother alone performing her own caesarean section.

After the fall of the monarchy, the revolutionary French government faced serious internal and external challenges, including the War of the First Coalition and insurrectionary War in the Vend\u00e9e. French revolutionary politicians believed a stable government was needed to quell the chaos.[17] On 11 March 1793, a Revolutionary Tribunal was established by Jacobins in the Convention.[54] On 6 April, Maximin Isnard and Georges Danton spearheaded the creation of a nine-member Committee of Public Safety to replace the larger Committee of General Defence. On 27 July 1793, Robespierre was elected to the Committee, although he had not sought the position.[55]\n\ndoc650942: 1st United States Congress.

The connection between conductor Serge Koussevitzsky\u2019s foundation and the Boston Symphony Orchestra led to the presumption that he and that orchestra would give the premiere, but Kurt Frederick, conductor of the Albuquerque Civic Symphony Orchestra, had heard about A Survivor from Warsaw and wrote to Schoenberg to ask permission to do the honors, and Schoenberg agreed, stipulating that in lieu of their performance fee the New Mexico musicians should prepare a full set of choral and orchestral parts and send those to him. The premiere was at first scheduled for Sept. 7, 1948, but was delayed until Nov. 4 of that year. Frederick conducted his orchestra at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque[2] with Sherman Smith as narrator. During the two-month delay, Koussevitzsky heard of Frederick\u2019s request and approved of the plan.[2]\n\ndoc740110: Committee of Public Safety.

Throughout the winter of 1792 and spring of 1793, Paris was plagued by food riots and mass hunger. The new Convention did little to remedy the problem until late spring of 1793, occupied instead with matters of war. Finally, on 6 April 1793, the Convention created the Committee of Public Safety, and was given a monumental task: \"To deal with the radical movements of the Enrag\u00e9s, food shortages and riots, the revolt in the Vend\u00e9e and in Brittany, recent defeats of its armies, and the desertion of its commanding general.\"[5] Most notably, the Committee of Public Safety instated a policy of terror, and the guillotine began to fall on perceived enemies of the republic at an ever-increasing rate, beginning the period known today as the Reign of Terror.[6]\n\ndoc1133961: French Directory. In July 1794, the members of the Convention began planning a new form of government and drafting a new Constitution, which would become the Constitution of the Year III (August 1795). An important aim was to prevent too much power from becoming concentrated in the hands of one man. One of the authors of the new Constitution, Fran\u00e7ois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas, wrote to the Convention:\n\ndoc740111: Committee of Public Safety. After Robespierre's election to the Committee on 27 July 1793, the Committee increased its membership to twelve. The list below represents the Committee's membership.\n\ndoc65211: French Revolution. This policy of price control was coeval with the Committee of Public Safety's rise to power and the Reign of Terror. The Committee first attempted to set the price for only a limited number of grain products but, by September 1793, it expanded the \"maximum\" to cover all foodstuffs and a long list of other goods.[119] Widespread shortages and famine ensued. The Committee reacted by sending dragoons into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize crops. This temporarily solved the problem in Paris, but the rest of the country suffered. By the spring of 1794, forced collection of food was not sufficient to feed even Paris and the days of the Committee were numbered. When Robespierre went to the guillotine in July of that year the crowd jeered, \"There goes the dirty maximum!\"[120]\n\ndoc1648468: Coronation of the British monarch. The music played at coronations has been primarily classical and religiously inspired. Much of the choral music uses texts from the Bible which have been used at coronations since King Edgar's coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for George\u00a0II's coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of Charles\u00a0II and Thomas Tomkins for Charles\u00a0I in 1621.[96]\n\ndoc591456: Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The division in France was at an all-time high when even families had different views on juring and non-juring priest.[13] The difference in families was primarily seen when the women would attend masses that where held by those who had defied the oath and men attended mass that was provided by clergymembers who had taken the oath.[13] It is important to note that even though priests who had not taken the Oath had the right to use the churches many were not allowed to use the buildings (this was done by priest who had sworn their allegiance) this furthermore demonstrated the division in the state.[13] On 29 November 1791, the Legislative Assembly, which had replaced the National Constituent Assembly, decreed that refractory priests could only exacerbate factionalism and aggravate extremists in the constituent assembly. The November 29th decree declared that no refractory priest could invoke the rights in the Constitution of the Clergy and that all such priests were suspect and so to be arrested. Louis XVI vetoed this decree (as he also did with another text concerning the creation of an army of 20,000 men on the orders of the Assembly, precipitating the monarchy's fall), which was toughened and re-issued a year later. Anti-Catholic persecution by the State would intensify into de-Christianization and propagation of the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being in 1793\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1794. During this time countless non-juring priests were interned in chains on prison ships in French harbors where most died within a few months from the appalling conditions.\n\ndoc619371: James Madison. Madison helped arrange the 1785 Mount Vernon Conference, which helped settle disputes regarding navigation rights on the Potomac River and also served as a model for future interstate conferences.[30] At the 1786 Annapolis Convention, he supported the calling of another convention to consider amending the Articles. After winning election to another term in Congress, Madison helped convince the other Congressmen to authorize the Philadelphia Convention for the purposes of proposing new amendments. But Madison had come to believe that the ineffectual Articles had to be superseded by a new constitution, and he began preparing for a convention that would propose an entirely new constitution.[31] Madison ensured that George Washington, who was popular throughout the country, and Robert Morris, who was influential in the critical state of Pennsylvania, would both broadly support Madison's plan to implement a new constitution.[32]\n\ndoc1648418: Coronation of the British monarch. A third recension was probably compiled during the reign of Henry\u00a0I and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a book of German liturgy compiled in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice.[2] It remained in use until the coronation of Edward\u00a0II in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ordo focussed on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings.[3] One manuscript of this recension is the Liber Regalis at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.[4]\n\ndoc838069: Joseph de Maistre. A member of the progressive Scottish Rite Masonic lodge at Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry from 1774 to 1790,[16] Maistre originally favoured political reform in France, supporting the efforts of the magistrates in the Parlements to force King Louis XVI to convene the Estates General. As a landowner in France, Maistre was eligible to join that body, and there is some evidence that he contemplated that possibility.[17] He was alarmed, however, by the decision of the States-General to combine clergy, aristocracy, and commoners into a single legislative body, which became the National Constituent Assembly. After the passing of the August Decrees on 4 August 1789 he decisively turned against the course of political events in France.[18]\n\ndoc591441: Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The Assembly passed the Civil Constitution on 12 July 1790, two days before the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. On that anniversary, the F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, Talleyrand and three hundred priests officiated at the \"altar of the nation\" erected on the Champ de Mars, wearing tricolor waistbands over their priestly vestments and calling down God's blessing upon the Revolution.\n\ndoc65230: French Revolution. Criteria for bringing someone before the Revolutionary Tribunal, created March 1793, had always been vast and vague.[135] By August, political disagreement seemed enough to be summoned before the Tribunal; appeal against a Tribunal verdict was impossible.[129] Late August 1793, an army general had been guillotined on the accusation of choosing too timid strategies on the battlefield.[129] Mid-October, the widowed former queen Marie Antoinette was on trial for a long list of charges such as \"teaching [her husband] Louis Capet the art of dissimulation\" and incest with her son, she too was guillotined.[129] In October 1793, 21 former 'Girondins' Convention members who hadn't left Paris after June were convicted to death and executed, on the charge of verbally supporting the preparation of an insurrection in Caen by fellow-Girondins.[129]\n\ndoc2352654: Silent film. Musical scores for early silent films were either improvised or compiled of classical or theatrical repertory music. Once full features became commonplace, however, music was compiled from photoplay music by the pianist, organist, orchestra conductor or the movie studio itself, which included a cue sheet with the film. These sheets were often lengthy, with detailed notes about effects and moods to watch for. Starting with the mostly original score composed by Joseph Carl Breil for D.\u00a0W. Griffith's groundbreaking epic The Birth of a Nation (1915), it became relatively common for the biggest-budgeted films to arrive at the exhibiting theater with original, specially composed scores.[14] However, the first designated full-blown scores had in fact been composed in 1908, by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns for The Assassination of the Duke of Guise,[15] and by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov for Stenka Razin.\n\ndoc2511458: Louis Antoine de Saint-Just. In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was initially unable to form a consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened.[51] By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report in the name of the Committee, and his damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins' trials must proceed, he said, and any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged on for months, but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to the guillotine on 31 October 1793.[52] Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers of arrest and punishment.[53]\n\ndoc1962851: Mount Vernon Conference. The conference was initially scheduled to begin March 21, 1785, in Alexandria, Virginia. Maryland delegates included Samuel Chase, Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, and Thomas Stone. From Virginia, Alexander Henderson and George Mason attended; James Madison and Edmund Randolph had been appointed but were not sufficiently notified of their appointments. None of Virginia's delegates were present when Maryland's arrived for the meeting.[1] George Washington, who had been corresponding with Thomas Stone about the conference,[6] offered them the hospitality of his Mount Vernon estate in Fairfax County, Virginia, while they waited, and then offered to host the gathering itself. Although not an official participant, Washington\u2014with his authoritative knowledge of the issues and active interest in Potomac navigation\u2014inspired the delegates and lent considerable prestige to the proceedings.[1]\n\ndoc2096118: Cello Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns). The work can be split into three different sections as follows:\n\ndoc1331544: Columbia University. On May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Dr. Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected President of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[38] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President George Washington and Vice President John Adams attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.[39]\n\ndoc1596663: Maximilien Robespierre. The same day, 28 July 1794, in the afternoon, Robespierre was guillotined without trial in the Place de la R\u00e9volution. His brother Augustin, Couthon, Saint-Just, Hanriot, and twelve other followers, among them the cobbler Antoine Simon, the jailor of Louis-Charles, Dauphin of France, were also executed.[85] When clearing Robespierre's neck, the executioner tore off the bandage that was holding his shattered jaw in place, causing Robespierre to produce an agonised scream until the fall of the blade silenced him.[86] Together with those executed with him, he was buried in a common grave at the newly opened Errancis Cemetery[87] (near what is now the Place Prosper-Goubaux). A plaque indicating the former site of this cemetery is located at 97 rue de Monceau, Paris. Between 1844 and 1859 (probably in 1848), the remains of all those buried there were moved to the Catacombs of Paris.\n\ndoc1575341: Book of Common Prayer. The Episcopal Church separated itself from the Church of England in 1789, the first church in the USA having been founded in 1607.(Cross & Livingstone 1975) Its prayer book, published in 1790, had as its sources the 1662 English book and the 1764 Scottish Liturgy (see above) which Bishop Seabury of Connecticut had brought over following his consecration in Aberdeen in 1784, containing elements of each (Perry 1922). The preface to the 1789 Book of Common Prayer says, \"this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doctrine, discipline, or worship...further than local circumstances require.\" There were some notable differences. For example, in the Communion service the prayer of consecration follows mainly the Scottish orders derived from 1549 (Shepherd 1965, 82) and found in the 1764 Book of Common Prayer. The compilers used materials derived from ancient liturgies especially Eastern Orthodox ones such as the Liturgy of St. James.(Shepherd 1965, 82) An epiclesis was included, as in the Scottish book, though modified to meet reformist objections. Overall, the book was modelled on the English Prayer Book, the Convention having resisted attempts at deletion and revision.(McGarvey & Gibson 1907) The 1789 American BCP reintroduced explicit sacrificial language in the Prayer of Consecration by adding the words \"which we now offer unto Thee\", after \"with these thy holy gifts\" from the 1549 BCP. The insertion undid Cranmer's rejection of the Eucharist as a material sacrifice by which the Church offers itself to God in an unbloody liturgical representation in and with the very same sacrifice of Christ who is both priest and victim, both offering and offered. This reworking thereby aligned the church's eucharistic theology more closely to that of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches.\n\ndoc463902: National Convention. The article on the Convention in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica concludes, \"The work of the Convention was immense in all branches of public affairs. To appreciate it without prejudice, one should recall that this assembly saved France from a civil war and invasion, that it founded the system of public education (Museum, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00c9cole des langues orientales, Conservatoire), created institutions of capital importance, like that of the Grand Livre de la Dette publique, and definitely established the social and political gains of the Revolution.\" By a decree of 4 February 1794 (16 pluvi\u00f4se) it also ratified and expanded to the whole French colonial empire the 1793 abolition of slavery on Saint-Domingue by civil commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel, though this did not affect Martinique or Guadeloupe and was abolished by the law of 20 May 1802.\n\ndoc1399010: French Revolution from the summer of 1790 to the establishment of the Legislative Assembly. The close of the Assembly was set for 29 September 1791.\n\ndoc1422871: Canadian Confederation. The original Fathers of Confederation are those delegates who attended any of the conferences held at Charlottetown and Quebec in 1864, or in London, United Kingdom, in 1866, leading to Confederation.[74]\n\ndoc916599: John Hanson. The Articles of Confederation stipulated that presidents of Congress serve one-year terms, and Hanson became the first to do so.[1][19] [20] Contrary to the claims of some of his later advocates, however, he was not the first president to serve under the Articles, nor the first to be elected under the Articles.[21] When the Articles went into effect in March 1781, Congress did not bother to elect a new president; instead, Samuel Huntington continued serving a term that had already exceeded a year.[22] On July 9, 1781, Samuel Johnston became the first man to be elected as president of Congress after the ratification of the Articles.[23] He declined the office, however, perhaps to make himself available for North Carolina's gubernatorial election.[24] After Johnston turned down the office, Thomas McKean was elected.[25][22] McKean served just a few months, resigning in October 1781 after hearing news of the British surrender at Yorktown. Congress asked him to remain in office until November, when a new session of Congress was scheduled to begin.[19] It was in that session that Hanson began to serve his one-year term. A highlight of Hanson's term was when George Washington presented Cornwallis's sword to Congress.[26]\n\ndoc1223937: Whiskey Rebellion. In October 1794, Washington traveled west to review the progress of the military expedition. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was \"the first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\".[99] Jonathan Forman led the Third Infantry Regiment of New Jersey troops against the Whiskey Rebellion, he wrote about his encounter with Washington:[100]\n\ndoc1279051: History of France. Maximilien Robespierre, since July 1793 member of the Committee of Public Prosperity,[66] on 5 February 1794 in a speech in the Convention identified Jacques H\u00e9bert and his faction as \"internal enemies\" working toward the triumph of tyranny. After a dubious trial H\u00e9bert and some allies were guillotined in March.[68] On 5 April, again at the instigation of Robespierre, Danton and 13 associated politicians were executed. A week later again 19 politicians. This hushed the Convention deputies: if henceforth they disagreed with Robespierre they hardly dared to speak out.[68] A law enacted on 10 June 1794 (22 Prairial II) further streamlined criminal procedures: if the Revolutionary Tribunal saw sufficient proof of someone being an \"enemy of the people\" a counsel for defence would not be allowed. The frequency of guillotine executions in Paris now rose from on average three a day to an average of 29 a day.[68]\n\ndoc515872: Caesarean section. The World Health Organization officially withdrew its previous recommendation of a 15% C-section rate in June 2010. Their official statement read, \"There is no empirical evidence for an optimum percentage. What matters most is that all women who need caesarean sections receive them.\"[84]\n\ndoc2512357: John Jay. The Court's business through its first three years primarily involved the establishment of rules and procedure; reading of commissions and admission of attorneys to the bar; and the Justices' duties in \"riding circuit,\" or presiding over cases in the circuit courts of the various federal judicial districts. No convention existed that precluded the involvement of Supreme Court Justices in political affairs, and Jay used his light workload as a Justice to freely participate in the business of Washington's administration. He used his circuit riding to spread word throughout the states of Washington's commitment to neutrality, then published reports of French minister Edmond-Charles Genet's campaign to win American support for France. However, Jay also established an early precedent for the Court's independence in 1790, when Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton wrote to Jay requesting the Court's endorsement of legislation that would assume the debts of the states. Jay replied that the Court's business was restricted to ruling on the constitutionality of cases being tried before it and refused to allow it to take a position either for or against the legislation.[71]\n\ndoc2213310: Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven). The British premiere was presented on 21 March 1825 by its commissioners, the Philharmonic Society of London, at its Argyll Rooms conducted by Sir George Smart and with the choral part sung in Italian. The American premiere was presented on 20 May 1846 by the newly formed New York Philharmonic at Castle Garden (in an attempt to raise funds for a new concert hall), conducted by the English-born George Loder with the choral part translated into English for the first time.\n\ndoc515828: Caesarean section. There are number of steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of adhesions. Such techniques and principles may include:\n\n"

Dr. Jesse Bennett (July 10, 1769 \u00e2\u20ac\u201dJuly 13, 1842) was the first American physician to perform a successful Caesarean section, which he performed on his own wife at the birth of their only child on January 14, 1794.[1][2]\n\ndoc515885: Caesarean section. The first successful Caesarean section to be performed in America took place in Mason County, Virginia (now Mason County, West Virginia), in 1794. The procedure was performed by Dr. Jesse Bennett on his wife Elizabeth.[103]\n\ndoc740113: Committee of Public Safety. July 1793 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c July 1794:\n\ndoc1427: Jesse Bennett. Because Dr. Bennett didn't report the operation during his life, it was long believed the first successful American Caesarian section had been performed in 1827 by Dr. John Lambert in Ohio. Dr. Lambert lived only ten miles from Dr. Bennett's practice.[3]\n\ndoc725527: Timeline of the French Revolution.

The Roman Lex Regia (royal law), later the Lex Caesarea (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715\u00e2\u20ac\u201c673 BC),[106] required the child of a mother dead in childbirth to be cut from her womb.[107] There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant,[108] that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.[109] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false.[110] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.[107][111] As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.[112] The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere, \"to cut\", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones. Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, \"cut from the womb\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \"Caesar\" which was then carried by his descendants.[107] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as \"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\".[113] Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar\"[114]\n\ndoc725526: Timeline of the French Revolution. The Convention rises against Robespierre (July 27, 1794)\n\ndoc740095: Committee of Public Safety. The execution of Robespierre in July 1794 represented a reactionary period against the Committee of Public Safety. This is known as the Thermidorian Reaction, as Robespierre's fall from power occurred during the Revolutionary month of Thermidor. The Committee's influence diminished,[1] and it was disestablished in 1795.\n\ndoc1430709: Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution.

On March 5, 2000, in Mexico, In\u00e9s Ram\u00edrez performed a Caesarean section on herself and survived, as did her son, Orlando Ruiz Ram\u00edrez.[104]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc740103: Committee of Public Safety. The elimination of the H\u00e9bertists and the Dantonists made evident the strength of the committees, as had their ability to control and silence opposition. The creation, in March 1794, of a \"General Police Bureau\"\u2014reporting nominally to the Committee of Public Safety, but more often directly to Robespierre and his closest ally, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just\u2014served to increase the power of the Committee of Public Safety, and of Robespierre himself.\n\ndoc2262687: United States Capitol cornerstone laying. A centennial rededication of the Capitol, roughly modeled after the cornerstone ceremony of 1793, was organized on September 18, 1893.[12] The pre-ceremonial parade proceeded along the same route followed by Washington's entourage in 1793 and was led by President Grover Cleveland, who rode in the presidential state coach accompanied by a squadron of United States Army cavalry. The president was followed by a ceremonial escort formed into four divisions.[13] The first division consisted of delegations from Masonic lodges and friendly societies. The second division was formed of contingents from lineage societies, including the Society of the Cincinnati, the Sons of the Revolution, and the Aztec Club of 1847. The third division included federal military forces, including units from the U.S. Army 3rd Field Artillery Regiment and the District of Columbia National Guard. The fourth division consisted of local fire brigades.[13] At the capitol, the United States Marine Band provided music, accompanied by a 1,500-person choir. Opening remarks were delivered by Cleveland, followed by a two-hour speech by William Wirt Henry, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and Patrick Henry's grandson.[1] According to news reports of the day, 150,000 spectators attended the event.[1][13]\n\ndoc740102: Committee of Public Safety. Consequently, though the H\u00e9bertists were arrested and executed in March 1794, the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security ensured that Desmoulins and Danton were also arrested. H\u00e9rault de S\u00e9chelles\u2014a friend and ally of Danton\u2014was expelled from the Committee of Public Safety, arrested, and tried alongside them. On 5 April 1794, the Dantonists went to the guillotine.[8]\n\ndoc2426479: Concierto de Aranjuez. On 11 December 1940 the concerto received its first performance in Madrid, at the Teatro Espa\u00f1ol de Madrid conducted by Jes\u00fas Ar\u00e1mbarri, with the same soloist. The United States premiere was given by Rey de la Torre on 19 November 1959, with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Robert Shaw.\n\ndoc740107: Committee of Public Safety. On the following day, 27 July 1794 (or 9 Thermidor according to the Revolutionary calendar), Saint-Just began to deliver a speech to the Convention in which he had planned to denounce Collot d'Herbois, Billaud-Varenne, and other members of the Committee of Public Safety. However, he was almost immediately interrupted by Tallien and by Billaud-Varenne, who accused Saint-Just of intending to \"murder the Convention.\"[13] Bar\u00e8re, Vadier, and Stanislas Fr\u00e9ron joined the accusations against Saint-Just and Robespierre. The arrest of Robespierre, his brother Augustin, and Saint-Just was ordered, along with that of their supporters, Philippe Le Bas and Georges Couthon.\n\ndoc113600: French First Republic. As a result of the spike in public violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, a party of six members of France's Legislative Assembly was assigned the task of overseeing elections. The resulting Convention was founded with the dual purpose of abolishing the monarchy and drafting a new constitution. The Convention's first act, on 10 August 1792, was to establish the French First Republic and officially strip the king of all political powers. The King, by then a private citizen bearing his family name of Capet, was subsequently put on trial for crimes of high treason starting in December 1792. On 16 January 1793 he was convicted, and on 21 January, he was executed by guillotine.[4]\n\ndoc463814: National Convention. Although the Convention lasted until 1795, power was effectively stripped from the elected deputies and concentrated in the small Committee of Public Safety from April 1793. The eight months from Fall 1793 to Spring 1794, when Maximilien Robespierre and his allies dominated the Committee of Public Safety, represent the most radical and bloodiest phase of the French Revolution, known as the Reign of Terror. After the fall of Robespierre, the Convention lasted for another year until a new constitution was written, ushering in the French Directory.\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515880: Caesarean section. Pliny the Elder theorized that Julius Caesar's name came from an ancestor who was born by caesarean section, but the truth of this is debated (see the discussion of the etymology of Caesar). The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by caesarean section. His first wife however died in childbirth, giving birth to a stilborn son who might have lived had a caesarean taken place.\n\ndoc515891: Caesarean section. Finally, the Roman praenomen (given name) Caeso was said to be given to children who were born via C-section. While this was probably just folk etymology made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.[117]\n\ndoc740106: Committee of Public Safety. When it became evident, in mid-July 1794, that Robespierre and Saint-Just were planning to strike against their political opponents Joseph Fouch\u00e9, Jean-Lambert Tallien, and Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier (the latter two of whom were members of the Committee of General Security), the fragile truce within the government was dissolved. Saint-Just and his fellow Committee of Public Safety member Bar\u00e8re attempted to keep the peace between the Committees of Public Safety and General Security; however, on 26 July, Robespierre delivered a speech to the National Convention in which he emphasized the need to \"purify\" the Committees and \"crush all factions.\"[12] In a speech to the Jacobin Club that night, he attacked Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, who had refused to allow the printing and distribution of his speech to the Convention.\n\ndoc515884: Caesarean section. European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc65238: French Revolution. Maximilien Robespierre, since July 1793 member of the Committee of Public Prosperity,[130] on 5 February 1794 in a speech in the Convention identified Jacques H\u00e9bert and his faction as \"internal enemies\" working toward the triumph of tyranny.[135] After a dubious trial H\u00e9bert and some allies, charged with counter-revolutionary activities,[152] were guillotined in March.[135]\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc515871: Caesarean section. In the United States C-section rates have increased from just over 20% in 1996 to 33% in 2011.[3] This increase has not resulted in improved outcomes resulting in the position that C-sections may be done too frequently.[3]\n\ndoc515811: Caesarean section. C-sections result in a small overall increase in poor outcomes in low risk pregnancies.[3] They also typically take longer to heal from, about six weeks, than vaginal birth.[2] The increased risks include breathing problems in the baby and amniotic fluid embolism and postpartum bleeding in the mother.[3] Established guidelines recommend that caesarean sections not be used before 39 weeks of pregnancy without a medical reason.[6] The method of delivery does not appear to have an effect on subsequent sexual function.[7]\n\ndoc298280: French Constitution of 1791. A twelve-member Constitutional Committee was convened on 14 July 1789 (coincidentally the day of the Storming of the Bastille). Its task was to do much of the drafting of the articles of the constitution. It included originally two members from the First Estate (Champion de Cic\u00e9, Archbishop of Bordeaux and Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun); two from the Second (the comte de Clermont-Tonnerre and the marquis de Lally-Tollendal); and four from the Third (Jean Joseph Mounier, Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s, Nicholas Bergasse, and Isaac Ren\u00e9 Guy le Chapelier).\n\ndoc463876: National Convention. On the evening of 10 Thermidor (28 July 1794), Robespierre, Saint-Just, Couthon and nineteen of their political allies were executed without trial. On the following day it was the turn of a large batch of 71 men, the largest mass execution in the entire course of the Revolution.[64]\n\ndoc1133960: French Directory. On 27 July 1794, members of the French Convention, the revolutionary parliament of France, rose up against its leader, Maximilien Robespierre, who was in the midst of executing thousands of suspected enemies of the Revolution. Robespierre and his leading followers were declared outside the law, and on 28 July were arrested and guillotined the same day. The Revolutionary Tribunal, which had sent thousands to the guillotine, ceased meeting and its head, Fouquier-Tinville, was arrested and imprisoned, and after trial was himself guillotined. More than five hundred suspected counter-revolutionaries awaiting trial and execution were immediately released.\n\ndoc740112: Committee of Public Safety.

In July 1793, following the defeat at the Convention of the Girondins, the prominent leader of the radical Jacobin, Maximilien Robespierre, was added to the Committee. The power of the Committee peaked between August 1793 and July 1794. In December 1793, the Convention formally conferred executive power upon the Committee.\n\ndoc1405576: The Lamb. Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy C, 1789, 1794 (Library of Congress), object 8 \"The Lamb\"\n\ndoc491904: Jacobin. In late June 1794, three colleagues on the Committee of Public Prosperity/Safety \u2013 Billaud-Varenne, Collot d'Herbois and Carnot \u2013 called Robespierre a dictator. Late July 1794, Robespierre and 21 associates including the Jacobin Saint-Just and the Montagnard Couthon were sentenced to death by the National Convention and guillotined.[22]\n\ndoc740098: Committee of Public Safety. The Committee was formally created on 6 April 1793. Closely associated with the leadership of Danton, it was initially known as \"the Danton Committee\".[3] Danton steered the Committee through the 31 May and 2 June 1793 journ\u00e9es that resulted in the fall of the Girondins, and through the intensifying war in the Vend\u00e9e. However, when the Committee was recomposed on 10 July, Danton was not included. Nevertheless, he continued to support the centralization of power by the Committee.[4]\n\ndoc6307: Music history of the United States during the colonial era. The English singer Benjamin Carr was especially notable. He arrived in New York in 1793, along with his brother and father. They soon became prominent music publishers and vendors, owning stores in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Carr himself was a composer, organist, pianist and a publisher and editor. They published, in Philadelphia, \"The President's March\" in 1793; written by Philip Phile, \"The President's March\" is one of the most enduring of American patriotic songs. The march was soon politicized, adopted by the Federalists as a rallying song.\n\ndoc515853: Caesarean section. The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of Misgav Ladach, a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al in 1994[52] and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. However, there is an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.[53][54]\n\ndoc2034118: 1793 in the United States. Events from the year 1793 in the United States.\n\ndoc515813: Caesarean section. Caesarean section is recommended when vaginal delivery might pose a risk to the mother or baby. C-sections are also carried out for personal and social reasons. Systematic reviews have found no strong evidence about the impact of caesareans for non-medical reasons.[10][11] Recommendations encourage counseling to identify the reasons for the request, addressing anxieties and information, and encouraging vaginal birth.[10][12] Elective caesareans at 38 weeks showed increased health complications in the newborn.[13] For this reason, planned caesarean sections (also known as elective caesarean sections) should not be scheduled before 39 weeks gestation unless there is medical reason to do so.\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc725520: Timeline of the French Revolution. The execution of Louis XVI (January 21, 1793)\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc1962854: Mount Vernon Conference. This second interstate political convention, formally titled \"A Meeting of Commissioners to Remedy Defects of the Federal Government\", convened at George Mann's Tavern[7] held in Annapolis, Maryland, on September 11, 1786,. Delegates from five states (appointed delegates from four others either arrived too late to participate or otherwise did not attend) gathered to discuss ways to facilitate commerce between the states and establish standard rules and regulations. As a result of the gathering, commissioners called for there to be another constitutional convention at which possible improvements to the Articles could be discussed. The desired convention took place in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.\n\ndoc2107804: Confederation Period. In 1785, Washington hosted the Mount Vernon Conference, which established an agreement between Maryland and Virginia regarding several commercial issues. Encouraged by this example of interstate cooperation, Madison convinced the Virginia assembly to host another conference, the Annapolis Convention, with the goal of promoting interstate trade.[101] Only five state delegations attended the convention, but the delegates that did attend largely agreed on the need to reform the federal government. The delegates called for a second convention to take place in 1787 in Philadelphia to consider constitutional reform. In the months after the Annapolis Convention, reformers took steps to ensure better turnout at the next convention. They secured the blessing of Congress to consider constitutional reform and made sure to invite Washington, the most prominent national leader. The nationalist call for a constitutional convention was bolstered by the outbreak of Shays' Rebellion, which convinced many of the need for a national government powerful enough to help suppress uprisings.[102]\n\ndoc1279053: History of France. In the Convention session of 27 July 1794, Robespierre and his allies hardly managed to say a word as they were constantly interrupted by a row of critics such as Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, Vadier, Bar\u00c3\u00a8re and acting president Thuriot. Finally, even Robespierre's own voice failed on him: it faltered at his last attempt to beg permission to speak. A decree was adopted to arrest Robespierre, Saint-Just and Couthon. 28 July, they and 19 others were beheaded. 29 July, again 70 Parisians were guillotined.[68] Subsequently, the Law of 22 Prairial (10 June 1794) was repealed, and the 'Girondins' expelled from the Convention in June 1793, if not dead yet, were reinstated as Convention deputies.[74]\n\ndoc432255: History of Europe. On 20 September 1792 the National Convention abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of war, the National Convention created the Committee of Public Safety, controlled by Maximilien de Robespierre of the Jacobin Club, to act as the country's executive. Under Robespierre, the committee initiated the Reign of Terror, during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles and those convicted by the Revolutionary Tribunal, often on the flimsiest of evidence. Internal tensions at Paris drove the Committee towards increasing assertions of radicalism and increasing suspicions, fueling new terror: A few months into this phase, more and more prominent revolutionaries were being sent to the guillotine by Robespierre and his faction, for example Madame Roland and Georges Danton. Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary insurrections were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the coup of 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794) and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierre's more extreme policies.\n\ndoc16518: Left\u2013right political spectrum. When the National Assembly was replaced in 1791 by a Legislative Assembly comprising entirely new members, the divisions continued. \"Innovators\" sat on the left, \"moderates\" gathered in the centre, while the \"conscientious defenders of the constitution\" found themselves sitting on the right, where the defenders of the Ancien R\u00e9gime had previously gathered.[clarification needed] When the succeeding National Convention met in 1792, the seating arrangement continued, but following the coup d'\u00e9tat of 2 June 1793 and the arrest of the Girondins the right side of the assembly was deserted and any remaining members who had sat there moved to the centre. However, following the Thermidorian Reaction of 1794 the members of the far-left were excluded and the method of seating was abolished. The new constitution included rules for the assembly that would \"break up the party groups\".[6] However, following the Restoration in 1814\u20131815 political clubs were again formed. The majority ultraroyalists chose to sit on the right. The \"constitutionals\" sat in the centre while independents sat on the left. The terms extreme right and extreme left as well as centre-right and centre-left came to be used to describe the nuances of ideology of different sections of the assembly.[7]\n\ndoc71142: Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The first congressional terms to begin under Section 1 were those of the 74th Congress, on January 3, 1935. The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin under Section 1 were the second terms of President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner, on January 20, 1937.\n\ndoc2002958: France. Political disagreements and enmity in the National Convention between October 1793 and July 1794 reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were going prosperous, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and from royalism.\n\ndoc1596640: Maximilien Robespierre. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Maximilien Robespierre, 1794[57]\n\ndoc1648427: Coronation of the British monarch. In early modern coronations, the events inside the abbey were usually recorded by artists and published in elaborate folio books of engravings,[30] the last of these was published in 1905 depicting the coronation which had taken place three years earlier.[31] Re-enactments of the ceremony were staged at London and provincial theatres; in 1761, a production featuring the Westminster Abbey choir at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden ran for three months after the real event.[30] In 1902, a request to record the ceremony on a gramophone record was rejected, but Sir\u00a0Benjamin Stone photographed the procession into the abbey.[31] Nine years later, at the coronation of George\u00a0V, Stone was allowed to photograph the recognition, the presentation of the swords, and the homage.[32]\n\ndoc177586: Voltaire. On 11 July 1791, he was enshrined in the Panth\u00e9on, after the National Assembly of France, which regarded him as a forerunner of the French Revolution, had his remains brought back to Paris.[101] It is estimated that a million people attended the procession, which stretched throughout Paris. There was an elaborate ceremony, complete with an orchestra, and the music included a piece that Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try had composed especially for the event, which included a part for the \"tuba curva\" (an instrument that originated in Roman times as the cornu but had recently been revived under a new name[102]).\n\ndoc650944: 1st United States Congress. Held December 6, 1790, through March 3, 1791, at Congress Hall in Philadelphia\n\ndoc65241: French Revolution. Meanwhile, France's external wars were going well, with victories over Austrian and British troops in May and June 1794 opening up Belgium for French conquest.[135] But cooperation within the Committee of Public Prosperity, since April 1793 the de facto executive government, started to break down. On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at 'the Committee' called him a dictator in his face \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should have the courage to say which deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, what Robespierre refused to do.[135]\n\ndoc298285: French Constitution of 1791. A second body, the Committee of Revisions, was struck September 1790, and included Antoine Barnave, Adrien Duport, and Charles de Lameth. Because the National Assembly was both a legislature and a constitutional convention, it was not always clear when its decrees were constitutional articles or mere statutes. It was the job of this committee to sort it out. The committee became very important in the days after the Champs de Mars Massacre, when a wave of revulsion against popular movements swept France and resulted in a renewed effort to preserve powers for the Crown. The result is the rise of the Feuillants, a new political faction led by Barnave, who used his position on the committee to preserve a number of powers for the Crown, such as the nomination of ambassadors, military leaders, and ministers.\n\ndoc1596638: Maximilien Robespierre. From 13 February to 13 March 1794, Robespierre withdrew from active business on the Committee due to illness. On 15 March, he reappeared in the Convention. H\u00c3\u00a9bert and nineteen of his followers were arrested on 19 March and guillotined on 24 March. Danton, Desmoulins and their friends were arrested on 30 March and guillotined on 5 April.\n\ndoc779285: Reign of Terror. Several historians consider the \"reign of terror\" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September,[1] June[2] or March (birth of the Revolutionary Tribunal), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 (September Massacres), or even July 1789 (when the first lynchings took place),[3] but there is a consensus that it ended with the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794.[1][2]\n\ndoc491874: Jacobin. In July 1794, the government of Robespierre and allies was pushed out of power; Robespierre and 21 associates were executed. In November 1794, the Jacobin Club was closed.\n\ndoc515887: Caesarean section. The patron saint of Caesarean section is Caesarius of Africa, a young deacon martyred at Terracina, who has replaced and Christianized the pagan figure of Caesar.[105] The martyr (Saint Cesareo, in italian) is invoked for the good success of this surgical procedure.\n\ndoc463864: National Convention. But at the end of the winter of 1793-4, the shortage of food took a sharp turn for the worse. The Hebertists incited sans-culottes to demand stringent measures, and at first the Committee did prove conciliatory. The Convention voted 10 million for relief,[clarification needed] on 3 Ventose, Barere presented a new general Maximum, and on the 8th Saint-Just obtained a decree confiscating the property of suspects and distributing it to the needy (Ventose decrees). The Hebertists felt that if they increased the pressure, they would triumph once and for all. Although the call appeared like one for insurrection it was probably just for a new demonstration, like the one in September. But the Committee of Public Safety decided on 22 Ventose Year II (12 March 1794) that the Hebertists posed too serious a threat. The Committee linked Hebert, Ronsin, Vincent, and Momoro to the emigres Proli, Cloots and Pereira, so as to present the Hebertists as parties to the \"foreign plot\". All were executed on 4 Germinal (24 March).[48] This move largely silenced the Hebertists, now without their leadership. Having succeeded in stifling dissent on the left, the Committee then turned on the Dantonists, several members of which were implicated in financial corruption. The Committee forced the Convention to lift the parliamentary immunity of nine Dantonist deputies, allowing them to be put on trial. On 5 April Dantonist leaders Danton, Delacroix, Desmoulins, and Philippeaux were executed.[49]\n\ndoc2563488: Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. On hearing of Mountbatten's death, the then Master of the Queen's Music, Malcolm Williamson, was moved to write the Lament in Memory of Lord Mountbatten of Burma for violin and string orchestra. The 11\u00c2\u00a0minute work was given its first performance on 5 May 1980 by the Scottish Baroque Ensemble, conducted by Leonard Friedman.[126]\n\ndoc1728837: America's Critical Period. In 1785, Washington hosted the Mount Vernon Conference, which established an agreement between Maryland and Virginia regarding several commercial issues.

After the 1760s, regular concerts became a part of the cultural landscape, as well as a wide variety of dancing. Operatic excerpts began to appear, and before the end of the century Canada had its first home-grown opera.[4] A \"Concert Hall\" existed in Qu\u00e9bec by 1764 and subscription concerts by 1770, given, one may presume, by band players and skilled amateurs.[26] Programs for the Qu\u00e9bec and Halifax concerts of the 1790s reveal orchestral and chamber music by Handel, J.C. Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Pleyel.[5] Canada's first two operas were written, ca. 1790 and ca. 1808 by composer, poet, and playwright Joseph Quesnel (1746\u20131809).[27] The instrument of favour for the lower class was the fiddle. Fiddlers were a fixture in most public drinking establishments.[28] God Save the King/Queen has been sung in Canada since British rule and by the mid-20th century was, along with \"O Canada\", one of the country's two de facto national anthems.[29][30][31][32]\n\ndoc515895: Caesarean section. Self-inflicted caesarean section is the concept of a mother alone performing her own caesarean section. There have apparently been a few successful cases, notably In\u00e9s Ram\u00edrez P\u00e9rez of Mexico who in March 2000, performed a successful Caesarean section on herself.[125][126][127]\n\ndoc1279052: History of France.

After the fall of the monarchy, the revolutionary French government faced serious internal and external challenges, including the War of the First Coalition and insurrectionary War in the Vend\u00e9e. French revolutionary politicians believed a stable government was needed to quell the chaos.[17] On 11 March 1793, a Revolutionary Tribunal was established by Jacobins in the Convention.[54] On 6 April, Maximin Isnard and Georges Danton spearheaded the creation of a nine-member Committee of Public Safety to replace the larger Committee of General Defence. On 27 July 1793, Robespierre was elected to the Committee, although he had not sought the position.[55]\n\ndoc650942: 1st United States Congress. Held March 4, 1789, through September 29, 1789, at Federal Hall in New York City\n\ndoc1809196: A Survivor from Warsaw. The connection between conductor Serge Koussevitzsky\u2019s foundation and the Boston Symphony Orchestra led to the presumption that he and that orchestra would give the premiere, but Kurt Frederick, conductor of the Albuquerque Civic Symphony Orchestra, had heard about A Survivor from Warsaw and wrote to Schoenberg to ask permission to do the honors, and Schoenberg agreed, stipulating that in lieu of their performance fee the New Mexico musicians should prepare a full set of choral and orchestral parts and send those to him. The premiere was at first scheduled for Sept. 7, 1948, but was delayed until Nov. 4 of that year. Frederick conducted his orchestra at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque[2] with Sherman Smith as narrator. During the two-month delay, Koussevitzsky heard of Frederick\u2019s request and approved of the plan.[2]\n\ndoc740110: Committee of Public Safety. The Committee was initially composed of nine members, all selected by the National Convention for one month at a time, without term limits. Its first members, instated on 6 April 1793, were as follows, in order of election.\n\ndoc113601: French First Republic. Throughout the winter of 1792 and spring of 1793, Paris was plagued by food riots and mass hunger. The new Convention did little to remedy the problem until late spring of 1793, occupied instead with matters of war. Finally, on 6 April 1793, the Convention created the Committee of Public Safety, and was given a monumental task: \"To deal with the radical movements of the Enrag\u00e9s, food shortages and riots, the revolt in the Vend\u00e9e and in Brittany, recent defeats of its armies, and the desertion of its commanding general.\"[5] Most notably, the Committee of Public Safety instated a policy of terror, and the guillotine began to fall on perceived enemies of the republic at an ever-increasing rate, beginning the period known today as the Reign of Terror.[6]\n\ndoc1133961: French Directory. In July 1794, the members of the Convention began planning a new form of government and drafting a new Constitution, which would become the Constitution of the Year III (August 1795). An important aim was to prevent too much power from becoming concentrated in the hands of one man. One of the authors of the new Constitution, Fran\u00e7ois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas, wrote to the Convention:\n\ndoc740111: Committee of Public Safety. After Robespierre's election to the Committee on 27 July 1793, the Committee increased its membership to twelve. The list below represents the Committee's membership.\n\ndoc65211: French Revolution. This policy of price control was coeval with the Committee of Public Safety's rise to power and the Reign of Terror. The Committee first attempted to set the price for only a limited number of grain products but, by September 1793, it expanded the \"maximum\" to cover all foodstuffs and a long list of other goods.[119] Widespread shortages and famine ensued. The Committee reacted by sending dragoons into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize crops. This temporarily solved the problem in Paris, but the rest of the country suffered. By the spring of 1794, forced collection of food was not sufficient to feed even Paris and the days of the Committee were numbered. When Robespierre went to the guillotine in July of that year the crowd jeered, \"There goes the dirty maximum!\"[120]\n\ndoc1648468: Coronation of the British monarch. The music played at coronations has been primarily classical and religiously inspired. Much of the choral music uses texts from the Bible which have been used at coronations since King Edgar's coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for George\u00a0II's coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of Charles\u00a0II and Thomas Tomkins for Charles\u00a0I in 1621.[96]\n\ndoc591456: Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The division in France was at an all-time high when even families had different views on juring and non-juring priest.[13] The difference in families was primarily seen when the women would attend masses that where held by those who had defied the oath and men attended mass that was provided by clergymembers who had taken the oath.[13] It is important to note that even though priests who had not taken the Oath had the right to use the churches many were not allowed to use the buildings (this was done by priest who had sworn their allegiance) this furthermore demonstrated the division in the state.[13] On 29 November 1791, the Legislative Assembly, which had replaced the National Constituent Assembly, decreed that refractory priests could only exacerbate factionalism and aggravate extremists in the constituent assembly. The November 29th decree declared that no refractory priest could invoke the rights in the Constitution of the Clergy and that all such priests were suspect and so to be arrested. Louis XVI vetoed this decree (as he also did with another text concerning the creation of an army of 20,000 men on the orders of the Assembly, precipitating the monarchy's fall), which was toughened and re-issued a year later. Anti-Catholic persecution by the State would intensify into de-Christianization and propagation of the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being in 1793\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1794. During this time countless non-juring priests were interned in chains on prison ships in French harbors where most died within a few months from the appalling conditions.\n\ndoc619371: James Madison. Madison helped arrange the 1785 Mount Vernon Conference, which helped settle disputes regarding navigation rights on the Potomac River and also served as a model for future interstate conferences.[30] At the 1786 Annapolis Convention, he supported the calling of another convention to consider amending the Articles. After winning election to another term in Congress, Madison helped convince the other Congressmen to authorize the Philadelphia Convention for the purposes of proposing new amendments. But Madison had come to believe that the ineffectual Articles had to be superseded by a new constitution, and he began preparing for a convention that would propose an entirely new constitution.[31] Madison ensured that George Washington, who was popular throughout the country, and Robert Morris, who was influential in the critical state of Pennsylvania, would both broadly support Madison's plan to implement a new constitution.[32]\n\ndoc1648418: Coronation of the British monarch. A third recension was probably compiled during the reign of Henry\u00a0I and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a book of German liturgy compiled in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice.[2] It remained in use until the coronation of Edward\u00a0II in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ordo focussed on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings.[3] One manuscript of this recension is the Liber Regalis at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.[4]\n\ndoc838069: Joseph de Maistre. A member of the progressive Scottish Rite Masonic lodge at Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry from 1774 to 1790,[16] Maistre originally favoured political reform in France, supporting the efforts of the magistrates in the Parlements to force King Louis XVI to convene the Estates General. As a landowner in France, Maistre was eligible to join that body, and there is some evidence that he contemplated that possibility.[17] He was alarmed, however, by the decision of the States-General to combine clergy, aristocracy, and commoners into a single legislative body, which became the National Constituent Assembly. After the passing of the August Decrees on 4 August 1789 he decisively turned against the course of political events in France.[18]\n\ndoc591441: Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The Assembly passed the Civil Constitution on 12 July 1790, two days before the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. On that anniversary, the F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, Talleyrand and three hundred priests officiated at the \"altar of the nation\" erected on the Champ de Mars, wearing tricolor waistbands over their priestly vestments and calling down God's blessing upon the Revolution.\n\ndoc65230: French Revolution. Criteria for bringing someone before the Revolutionary Tribunal, created March 1793, had always been vast and vague.[135] By August, political disagreement seemed enough to be summoned before the Tribunal; appeal against a Tribunal verdict was impossible.[129] Late August 1793, an army general had been guillotined on the accusation of choosing too timid strategies on the battlefield.[129] Mid-October, the widowed former queen Marie Antoinette was on trial for a long list of charges such as \"teaching [her husband] Louis Capet the art of dissimulation\" and incest with her son, she too was guillotined.[129] In October 1793, 21 former 'Girondins' Convention members who hadn't left Paris after June were convicted to death and executed, on the charge of verbally supporting the preparation of an insurrection in Caen by fellow-Girondins.[129]\n\ndoc2352654: Silent film. Musical scores for early silent films were either improvised or compiled of classical or theatrical repertory music. Once full features became commonplace, however, music was compiled from photoplay music by the pianist, organist, orchestra conductor or the movie studio itself, which included a cue sheet with the film. These sheets were often lengthy, with detailed notes about effects and moods to watch for. Starting with the mostly original score composed by Joseph Carl Breil for D.\u00a0W. Griffith's groundbreaking epic The Birth of a Nation (1915), it became relatively common for the biggest-budgeted films to arrive at the exhibiting theater with original, specially composed scores.[14] However, the first designated full-blown scores had in fact been composed in 1908, by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns for The Assassination of the Duke of Guise,[15] and by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov for Stenka Razin.\n\ndoc2511458: Louis Antoine de Saint-Just. In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was initially unable to form a consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened.[51] By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report in the name of the Committee, and his damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins' trials must proceed, he said, and any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged on for months, but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to the guillotine on 31 October 1793.[52] Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers of arrest and punishment.[53]\n\ndoc1962851: Mount Vernon Conference. The conference was initially scheduled to begin March 21, 1785, in Alexandria, Virginia. Maryland delegates included Samuel Chase, Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, and Thomas Stone. From Virginia, Alexander Henderson and George Mason attended; James Madison and Edmund Randolph had been appointed but were not sufficiently notified of their appointments. None of Virginia's delegates were present when Maryland's arrived for the meeting.[1] George Washington, who had been corresponding with Thomas Stone about the conference,[6] offered them the hospitality of his Mount Vernon estate in Fairfax County, Virginia, while they waited, and then offered to host the gathering itself. Although not an official participant, Washington\u2014with his authoritative knowledge of the issues and active interest in Potomac navigation\u2014inspired the delegates and lent considerable prestige to the proceedings.[1]\n\ndoc2096118: Cello Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns). The work can be split into three different sections as follows:\n\ndoc1331544: Columbia University. On May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Dr. Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected President of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[38] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President George Washington and Vice President John Adams attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.[39]\n\ndoc1596663: Maximilien Robespierre. The same day, 28 July 1794, in the afternoon, Robespierre was guillotined without trial in the Place de la R\u00e9volution. His brother Augustin, Couthon, Saint-Just, Hanriot, and twelve other followers, among them the cobbler Antoine Simon, the jailor of Louis-Charles, Dauphin of France, were also executed.[85] When clearing Robespierre's neck, the executioner tore off the bandage that was holding his shattered jaw in place, causing Robespierre to produce an agonised scream until the fall of the blade silenced him.[86] Together with those executed with him, he was buried in a common grave at the newly opened Errancis Cemetery[87] (near what is now the Place Prosper-Goubaux). A plaque indicating the former site of this cemetery is located at 97 rue de Monceau, Paris. Between 1844 and 1859 (probably in 1848), the remains of all those buried there were moved to the Catacombs of Paris.\n\ndoc1575341: Book of Common Prayer. The Episcopal Church separated itself from the Church of England in 1789, the first church in the USA having been founded in 1607.(Cross & Livingstone 1975) Its prayer book, published in 1790, had as its sources the 1662 English book and the 1764 Scottish Liturgy (see above) which Bishop Seabury of Connecticut had brought over following his consecration in Aberdeen in 1784, containing elements of each (Perry 1922). The preface to the 1789 Book of Common Prayer says, \"this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doctrine, discipline, or worship...further than local circumstances require.\" There were some notable differences. For example, in the Communion service the prayer of consecration follows mainly the Scottish orders derived from 1549 (Shepherd 1965, 82) and found in the 1764 Book of Common Prayer. The compilers used materials derived from ancient liturgies especially Eastern Orthodox ones such as the Liturgy of St. James.(Shepherd 1965, 82) An epiclesis was included, as in the Scottish book, though modified to meet reformist objections. Overall, the book was modelled on the English Prayer Book, the Convention having resisted attempts at deletion and revision.(McGarvey & Gibson 1907) The 1789 American BCP reintroduced explicit sacrificial language in the Prayer of Consecration by adding the words \"which we now offer unto Thee\", after \"with these thy holy gifts\" from the 1549 BCP. The insertion undid Cranmer's rejection of the Eucharist as a material sacrifice by which the Church offers itself to God in an unbloody liturgical representation in and with the very same sacrifice of Christ who is both priest and victim, both offering and offered. This reworking thereby aligned the church's eucharistic theology more closely to that of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches.\n\ndoc463902: National Convention. The article on the Convention in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica concludes, \"The work of the Convention was immense in all branches of public affairs. To appreciate it without prejudice, one should recall that this assembly saved France from a civil war and invasion, that it founded the system of public education (Museum, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00c9cole des langues orientales, Conservatoire), created institutions of capital importance, like that of the Grand Livre de la Dette publique, and definitely established the social and political gains of the Revolution.\" By a decree of 4 February 1794 (16 pluvi\u00f4se) it also ratified and expanded to the whole French colonial empire the 1793 abolition of slavery on Saint-Domingue by civil commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel, though this did not affect Martinique or Guadeloupe and was abolished by the law of 20 May 1802.\n\ndoc1399010: French Revolution from the summer of 1790 to the establishment of the Legislative Assembly. The close of the Assembly was set for 29 September 1791.\n\ndoc1422871: Canadian Confederation. The original Fathers of Confederation are those delegates who attended any of the conferences held at Charlottetown and Quebec in 1864, or in London, United Kingdom, in 1866, leading to Confederation.[74]\n\ndoc916599: John Hanson. The Articles of Confederation stipulated that presidents of Congress serve one-year terms, and Hanson became the first to do so.[1][19] [20] Contrary to the claims of some of his later advocates, however, he was not the first president to serve under the Articles, nor the first to be elected under the Articles.[21] When the Articles went into effect in March 1781, Congress did not bother to elect a new president; instead, Samuel Huntington continued serving a term that had already exceeded a year.[22] On July 9, 1781, Samuel Johnston became the first man to be elected as president of Congress after the ratification of the Articles.[23] He declined the office, however, perhaps to make himself available for North Carolina's gubernatorial election.[24] After Johnston turned down the office, Thomas McKean was elected.[25][22] McKean served just a few months, resigning in October 1781 after hearing news of the British surrender at Yorktown. Congress asked him to remain in office until November, when a new session of Congress was scheduled to begin.[19] It was in that session that Hanson began to serve his one-year term. A highlight of Hanson's term was when George Washington presented Cornwallis's sword to Congress.[26]\n\ndoc1223937: Whiskey Rebellion. In October 1794, Washington traveled west to review the progress of the military expedition. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was \"the first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\".[99] Jonathan Forman led the Third Infantry Regiment of New Jersey troops against the Whiskey Rebellion, he wrote about his encounter with Washington:[100]\n\ndoc1279051: History of France. Maximilien Robespierre, since July 1793 member of the Committee of Public Prosperity,[66] on 5 February 1794 in a speech in the Convention identified Jacques H\u00e9bert and his faction as \"internal enemies\" working toward the triumph of tyranny. After a dubious trial H\u00e9bert and some allies were guillotined in March.[68] On 5 April, again at the instigation of Robespierre, Danton and 13 associated politicians were executed. A week later again 19 politicians. This hushed the Convention deputies: if henceforth they disagreed with Robespierre they hardly dared to speak out.[68] A law enacted on 10 June 1794 (22 Prairial II) further streamlined criminal procedures: if the Revolutionary Tribunal saw sufficient proof of someone being an \"enemy of the people\" a counsel for defence would not be allowed. The frequency of guillotine executions in Paris now rose from on average three a day to an average of 29 a day.[68]\n\ndoc515872: Caesarean section. The World Health Organization officially withdrew its previous recommendation of a 15% C-section rate in June 2010. Their official statement read, \"There is no empirical evidence for an optimum percentage. What matters most is that all women who need caesarean sections receive them.\"[84]\n\ndoc2512357: John Jay. The Court's business through its first three years primarily involved the establishment of rules and procedure; reading of commissions and admission of attorneys to the bar; and the Justices' duties in \"riding circuit,\" or presiding over cases in the circuit courts of the various federal judicial districts. No convention existed that precluded the involvement of Supreme Court Justices in political affairs, and Jay used his light workload as a Justice to freely participate in the business of Washington's administration. He used his circuit riding to spread word throughout the states of Washington's commitment to neutrality, then published reports of French minister Edmond-Charles Genet's campaign to win American support for France. However, Jay also established an early precedent for the Court's independence in 1790, when Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton wrote to Jay requesting the Court's endorsement of legislation that would assume the debts of the states. Jay replied that the Court's business was restricted to ruling on the constitutionality of cases being tried before it and refused to allow it to take a position either for or against the legislation.[71]\n\ndoc2213310: Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven). The British premiere was presented on 21 March 1825 by its commissioners, the Philharmonic Society of London, at its Argyll Rooms conducted by Sir George Smart and with the choral part sung in Italian. The American premiere was presented on 20 May 1846 by the newly formed New York Philharmonic at Castle Garden (in an attempt to raise funds for a new concert hall), conducted by the English-born George Loder with the choral part translated into English for the first time.\n\ndoc515828: Caesarean section. There are number of steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of adhesions. Such techniques and principles may include:\n\n"

Dr. Jesse Bennett (July 10, 1769 \u00e2\u20ac\u201dJuly 13, 1842) was the first American physician to perform a successful Caesarean section, which he performed on his own wife at the birth of their only child on January 14, 1794.[1][2]\n\ndoc515885: Caesarean section. The first successful Caesarean section to be performed in America took place in Mason County, Virginia (now Mason County, West Virginia), in 1794. The procedure was performed by Dr. Jesse Bennett on his wife Elizabeth.[103]\n\ndoc740113: Committee of Public Safety. July 1793 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c July 1794:\n\ndoc1427: Jesse Bennett. Because Dr. Bennett didn't report the operation during his life, it was long believed the first successful American Caesarian section had been performed in 1827 by Dr. John Lambert in Ohio. Dr. Lambert lived only ten miles from Dr. Bennett's practice.[3]\n\ndoc725527: Timeline of the French Revolution.

The Roman Lex Regia (royal law), later the Lex Caesarea (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715\u00e2\u20ac\u201c673 BC),[106] required the child of a mother dead in childbirth to be cut from her womb.[107] There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant,[108] that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.[109] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false.[110] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.[107][111] As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.[112] The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere, \"to cut\", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones. Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, \"cut from the womb\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \"Caesar\" which was then carried by his descendants.[107] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as \"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\".[113] Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar\"[114]\n\ndoc725526: Timeline of the French Revolution. The Convention rises against Robespierre (July 27, 1794)\n\ndoc740095: Committee of Public Safety. The execution of Robespierre in July 1794 represented a reactionary period against the Committee of Public Safety. This is known as the Thermidorian Reaction, as Robespierre's fall from power occurred during the Revolutionary month of Thermidor. The Committee's influence diminished,[1] and it was disestablished in 1795.\n\ndoc1430709: Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution.

On March 5, 2000, in Mexico, In\u00e9s Ram\u00edrez performed a Caesarean section on herself and survived, as did her son, Orlando Ruiz Ram\u00edrez.[104]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc740103: Committee of Public Safety. The elimination of the H\u00e9bertists and the Dantonists made evident the strength of the committees, as had their ability to control and silence opposition. The creation, in March 1794, of a \"General Police Bureau\"\u2014reporting nominally to the Committee of Public Safety, but more often directly to Robespierre and his closest ally, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just\u2014served to increase the power of the Committee of Public Safety, and of Robespierre himself.\n\ndoc2262687: United States Capitol cornerstone laying. A centennial rededication of the Capitol, roughly modeled after the cornerstone ceremony of 1793, was organized on September 18, 1893.[12] The pre-ceremonial parade proceeded along the same route followed by Washington's entourage in 1793 and was led by President Grover Cleveland, who rode in the presidential state coach accompanied by a squadron of United States Army cavalry. The president was followed by a ceremonial escort formed into four divisions.[13] The first division consisted of delegations from Masonic lodges and friendly societies. The second division was formed of contingents from lineage societies, including the Society of the Cincinnati, the Sons of the Revolution, and the Aztec Club of 1847. The third division included federal military forces, including units from the U.S. Army 3rd Field Artillery Regiment and the District of Columbia National Guard. The fourth division consisted of local fire brigades.[13] At the capitol, the United States Marine Band provided music, accompanied by a 1,500-person choir. Opening remarks were delivered by Cleveland, followed by a two-hour speech by William Wirt Henry, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and Patrick Henry's grandson.[1] According to news reports of the day, 150,000 spectators attended the event.[1][13]\n\ndoc740102: Committee of Public Safety. Consequently, though the H\u00e9bertists were arrested and executed in March 1794, the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security ensured that Desmoulins and Danton were also arrested. H\u00e9rault de S\u00e9chelles\u2014a friend and ally of Danton\u2014was expelled from the Committee of Public Safety, arrested, and tried alongside them. On 5 April 1794, the Dantonists went to the guillotine.[8]\n\ndoc2426479: Concierto de Aranjuez. On 11 December 1940 the concerto received its first performance in Madrid, at the Teatro Espa\u00f1ol de Madrid conducted by Jes\u00fas Ar\u00e1mbarri, with the same soloist. The United States premiere was given by Rey de la Torre on 19 November 1959, with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Robert Shaw.\n\ndoc740107: Committee of Public Safety. On the following day, 27 July 1794 (or 9 Thermidor according to the Revolutionary calendar), Saint-Just began to deliver a speech to the Convention in which he had planned to denounce Collot d'Herbois, Billaud-Varenne, and other members of the Committee of Public Safety. However, he was almost immediately interrupted by Tallien and by Billaud-Varenne, who accused Saint-Just of intending to \"murder the Convention.\"[13] Bar\u00e8re, Vadier, and Stanislas Fr\u00e9ron joined the accusations against Saint-Just and Robespierre. The arrest of Robespierre, his brother Augustin, and Saint-Just was ordered, along with that of their supporters, Philippe Le Bas and Georges Couthon.\n\ndoc113600: French First Republic. As a result of the spike in public violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, a party of six members of France's Legislative Assembly was assigned the task of overseeing elections. The resulting Convention was founded with the dual purpose of abolishing the monarchy and drafting a new constitution. The Convention's first act, on 10 August 1792, was to establish the French First Republic and officially strip the king of all political powers. The King, by then a private citizen bearing his family name of Capet, was subsequently put on trial for crimes of high treason starting in December 1792. On 16 January 1793 he was convicted, and on 21 January, he was executed by guillotine.[4]\n\ndoc463814: National Convention. Although the Convention lasted until 1795, power was effectively stripped from the elected deputies and concentrated in the small Committee of Public Safety from April 1793. The eight months from Fall 1793 to Spring 1794, when Maximilien Robespierre and his allies dominated the Committee of Public Safety, represent the most radical and bloodiest phase of the French Revolution, known as the Reign of Terror. After the fall of Robespierre, the Convention lasted for another year until a new constitution was written, ushering in the French Directory.\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515880: Caesarean section. Pliny the Elder theorized that Julius Caesar's name came from an ancestor who was born by caesarean section, but the truth of this is debated (see the discussion of the etymology of Caesar). The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by caesarean section. His first wife however died in childbirth, giving birth to a stilborn son who might have lived had a caesarean taken place.\n\ndoc515891: Caesarean section. Finally, the Roman praenomen (given name) Caeso was said to be given to children who were born via C-section. While this was probably just folk etymology made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.[117]\n\ndoc740106: Committee of Public Safety. When it became evident, in mid-July 1794, that Robespierre and Saint-Just were planning to strike against their political opponents Joseph Fouch\u00e9, Jean-Lambert Tallien, and Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier (the latter two of whom were members of the Committee of General Security), the fragile truce within the government was dissolved. Saint-Just and his fellow Committee of Public Safety member Bar\u00e8re attempted to keep the peace between the Committees of Public Safety and General Security; however, on 26 July, Robespierre delivered a speech to the National Convention in which he emphasized the need to \"purify\" the Committees and \"crush all factions.\"[12] In a speech to the Jacobin Club that night, he attacked Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, who had refused to allow the printing and distribution of his speech to the Convention.\n\ndoc515884: Caesarean section. European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc65238: French Revolution. Maximilien Robespierre, since July 1793 member of the Committee of Public Prosperity,[130] on 5 February 1794 in a speech in the Convention identified Jacques H\u00e9bert and his faction as \"internal enemies\" working toward the triumph of tyranny.[135] After a dubious trial H\u00e9bert and some allies, charged with counter-revolutionary activities,[152] were guillotined in March.[135]\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc515871: Caesarean section. In the United States C-section rates have increased from just over 20% in 1996 to 33% in 2011.[3] This increase has not resulted in improved outcomes resulting in the position that C-sections may be done too frequently.[3]\n\ndoc515811: Caesarean section. C-sections result in a small overall increase in poor outcomes in low risk pregnancies.[3] They also typically take longer to heal from, about six weeks, than vaginal birth.[2] The increased risks include breathing problems in the baby and amniotic fluid embolism and postpartum bleeding in the mother.[3] Established guidelines recommend that caesarean sections not be used before 39 weeks of pregnancy without a medical reason.[6] The method of delivery does not appear to have an effect on subsequent sexual function.[7]\n\ndoc298280: French Constitution of 1791. A twelve-member Constitutional Committee was convened on 14 July 1789 (coincidentally the day of the Storming of the Bastille). Its task was to do much of the drafting of the articles of the constitution. It included originally two members from the First Estate (Champion de Cic\u00e9, Archbishop of Bordeaux and Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun); two from the Second (the comte de Clermont-Tonnerre and the marquis de Lally-Tollendal); and four from the Third (Jean Joseph Mounier, Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s, Nicholas Bergasse, and Isaac Ren\u00e9 Guy le Chapelier).\n\ndoc463876: National Convention. On the evening of 10 Thermidor (28 July 1794), Robespierre, Saint-Just, Couthon and nineteen of their political allies were executed without trial. On the following day it was the turn of a large batch of 71 men, the largest mass execution in the entire course of the Revolution.[64]\n\ndoc1133960: French Directory. On 27 July 1794, members of the French Convention, the revolutionary parliament of France, rose up against its leader, Maximilien Robespierre, who was in the midst of executing thousands of suspected enemies of the Revolution. Robespierre and his leading followers were declared outside the law, and on 28 July were arrested and guillotined the same day. The Revolutionary Tribunal, which had sent thousands to the guillotine, ceased meeting and its head, Fouquier-Tinville, was arrested and imprisoned, and after trial was himself guillotined. More than five hundred suspected counter-revolutionaries awaiting trial and execution were immediately released.\n\ndoc740112: Committee of Public Safety. April 1793 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c July 1793:\n\ndoc740094: Committee of Public Safety. In July 1793, following the defeat at the Convention of the Girondins, the prominent leader of the radical Jacobin, Maximilien Robespierre, was added to the Committee. The power of the Committee peaked between August 1793 and July 1794. In December 1793, the Convention formally conferred executive power upon the Committee.\n\ndoc1405576: The Lamb.

In late June 1794, three colleagues on the Committee of Public Prosperity/Safety \u2013 Billaud-Varenne, Collot d'Herbois and Carnot \u2013 called Robespierre a dictator. Late July 1794, Robespierre and 21 associates including the Jacobin Saint-Just and the Montagnard Couthon were sentenced to death by the National Convention and guillotined.[22]\n\ndoc740098: Committee of Public Safety. The Committee was formally created on 6 April 1793. Closely associated with the leadership of Danton, it was initially known as \"the Danton Committee\".[3] Danton steered the Committee through the 31 May and 2 June 1793 journ\u00e9es that resulted in the fall of the Girondins, and through the intensifying war in the Vend\u00e9e. However, when the Committee was recomposed on 10 July, Danton was not included. Nevertheless, he continued to support the centralization of power by the Committee.[4]\n\ndoc6307: Music history of the United States during the colonial era. The English singer Benjamin Carr was especially notable. He arrived in New York in 1793, along with his brother and father. They soon became prominent music publishers and vendors, owning stores in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Carr himself was a composer, organist, pianist and a publisher and editor. They published, in Philadelphia, \"The President's March\" in 1793; written by Philip Phile, \"The President's March\" is one of the most enduring of American patriotic songs. The march was soon politicized, adopted by the Federalists as a rallying song.\n\ndoc515853: Caesarean section. The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of Misgav Ladach, a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al in 1994[52] and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. However, there is an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.[53][54]\n\ndoc2034118: 1793 in the United States. Events from the year 1793 in the United States.\n\ndoc515813: Caesarean section. Caesarean section is recommended when vaginal delivery might pose a risk to the mother or baby. C-sections are also carried out for personal and social reasons. Systematic reviews have found no strong evidence about the impact of caesareans for non-medical reasons.[10][11] Recommendations encourage counseling to identify the reasons for the request, addressing anxieties and information, and encouraging vaginal birth.[10][12] Elective caesareans at 38 weeks showed increased health complications in the newborn.[13] For this reason, planned caesarean sections (also known as elective caesarean sections) should not be scheduled before 39 weeks gestation unless there is medical reason to do so.\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc725520: Timeline of the French Revolution. The execution of Louis XVI (January 21, 1793)\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc1962854: Mount Vernon Conference. This second interstate political convention, formally titled \"A Meeting of Commissioners to Remedy Defects of the Federal Government\", convened at George Mann's Tavern[7] held in Annapolis, Maryland, on September 11, 1786,. Delegates from five states (appointed delegates from four others either arrived too late to participate or otherwise did not attend) gathered to discuss ways to facilitate commerce between the states and establish standard rules and regulations. As a result of the gathering, commissioners called for there to be another constitutional convention at which possible improvements to the Articles could be discussed. The desired convention took place in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.\n\ndoc2107804: Confederation Period. In 1785, Washington hosted the Mount Vernon Conference, which established an agreement between Maryland and Virginia regarding several commercial issues. Encouraged by this example of interstate cooperation, Madison convinced the Virginia assembly to host another conference, the Annapolis Convention, with the goal of promoting interstate trade.[101] Only five state delegations attended the convention, but the delegates that did attend largely agreed on the need to reform the federal government. The delegates called for a second convention to take place in 1787 in Philadelphia to consider constitutional reform. In the months after the Annapolis Convention, reformers took steps to ensure better turnout at the next convention. They secured the blessing of Congress to consider constitutional reform and made sure to invite Washington, the most prominent national leader. The nationalist call for a constitutional convention was bolstered by the outbreak of Shays' Rebellion, which convinced many of the need for a national government powerful enough to help suppress uprisings.[102]\n\ndoc1279053: History of France. In the Convention session of 27 July 1794, Robespierre and his allies hardly managed to say a word as they were constantly interrupted by a row of critics such as Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, Vadier, Bar\u00c3\u00a8re and acting president Thuriot. Finally, even Robespierre's own voice failed on him: it faltered at his last attempt to beg permission to speak. A decree was adopted to arrest Robespierre, Saint-Just and Couthon. 28 July, they and 19 others were beheaded. 29 July, again 70 Parisians were guillotined.[68] Subsequently, the Law of 22 Prairial (10 June 1794) was repealed, and the 'Girondins' expelled from the Convention in June 1793, if not dead yet, were reinstated as Convention deputies.[74]\n\ndoc432255: History of Europe. On 20 September 1792 the National Convention abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of war, the National Convention created the Committee of Public Safety, controlled by Maximilien de Robespierre of the Jacobin Club, to act as the country's executive. Under Robespierre, the committee initiated the Reign of Terror, during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles and those convicted by the Revolutionary Tribunal, often on the flimsiest of evidence. Internal tensions at Paris drove the Committee towards increasing assertions of radicalism and increasing suspicions, fueling new terror: A few months into this phase, more and more prominent revolutionaries were being sent to the guillotine by Robespierre and his faction, for example Madame Roland and Georges Danton. Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary insurrections were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the coup of 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794) and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierre's more extreme policies.\n\ndoc16518: Left\u2013right political spectrum. When the National Assembly was replaced in 1791 by a Legislative Assembly comprising entirely new members, the divisions continued. \"Innovators\" sat on the left, \"moderates\" gathered in the centre, while the \"conscientious defenders of the constitution\" found themselves sitting on the right, where the defenders of the Ancien R\u00e9gime had previously gathered.[clarification needed] When the succeeding National Convention met in 1792, the seating arrangement continued, but following the coup d'\u00e9tat of 2 June 1793 and the arrest of the Girondins the right side of the assembly was deserted and any remaining members who had sat there moved to the centre. However, following the Thermidorian Reaction of 1794 the members of the far-left were excluded and the method of seating was abolished. The new constitution included rules for the assembly that would \"break up the party groups\".[6] However, following the Restoration in 1814\u20131815 political clubs were again formed. The majority ultraroyalists chose to sit on the right. The \"constitutionals\" sat in the centre while independents sat on the left. The terms extreme right and extreme left as well as centre-right and centre-left came to be used to describe the nuances of ideology of different sections of the assembly.[7]\n\ndoc71142: Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The first congressional terms to begin under Section 1 were those of the 74th Congress, on January 3, 1935. The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin under Section 1 were the second terms of President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner, on January 20, 1937.\n\ndoc2002958: France. Political disagreements and enmity in the National Convention between October 1793 and July 1794 reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were going prosperous, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and from royalism.\n\ndoc1596640: Maximilien Robespierre. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Maximilien Robespierre, 1794[57]\n\ndoc1648427: Coronation of the British monarch. In early modern coronations, the events inside the abbey were usually recorded by artists and published in elaborate folio books of engravings,[30] the last of these was published in 1905 depicting the coronation which had taken place three years earlier.[31] Re-enactments of the ceremony were staged at London and provincial theatres; in 1761, a production featuring the Westminster Abbey choir at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden ran for three months after the real event.[30] In 1902, a request to record the ceremony on a gramophone record was rejected, but Sir\u00a0Benjamin Stone photographed the procession into the abbey.[31] Nine years later, at the coronation of George\u00a0V, Stone was allowed to photograph the recognition, the presentation of the swords, and the homage.[32]\n\ndoc177586: Voltaire. On 11 July 1791, he was enshrined in the Panth\u00e9on, after the National Assembly of France, which regarded him as a forerunner of the French Revolution, had his remains brought back to Paris.[101] It is estimated that a million people attended the procession, which stretched throughout Paris. There was an elaborate ceremony, complete with an orchestra, and the music included a piece that Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try had composed especially for the event, which included a part for the \"tuba curva\" (an instrument that originated in Roman times as the cornu but had recently been revived under a new name[102]).\n\ndoc650944: 1st United States Congress. Held December 6, 1790, through March 3, 1791, at Congress Hall in Philadelphia\n\ndoc65241: French Revolution. Meanwhile, France's external wars were going well, with victories over Austrian and British troops in May and June 1794 opening up Belgium for French conquest.[135] But cooperation within the Committee of Public Prosperity, since April 1793 the de facto executive government, started to break down. On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at 'the Committee' called him a dictator in his face \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should have the courage to say which deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, what Robespierre refused to do.[135]\n\ndoc298285: French Constitution of 1791. A second body, the Committee of Revisions, was struck September 1790, and included Antoine Barnave, Adrien Duport, and Charles de Lameth. Because the National Assembly was both a legislature and a constitutional convention, it was not always clear when its decrees were constitutional articles or mere statutes. It was the job of this committee to sort it out. The committee became very important in the days after the Champs de Mars Massacre, when a wave of revulsion against popular movements swept France and resulted in a renewed effort to preserve powers for the Crown. The result is the rise of the Feuillants, a new political faction led by Barnave, who used his position on the committee to preserve a number of powers for the Crown, such as the nomination of ambassadors, military leaders, and ministers.\n\ndoc1596638: Maximilien Robespierre. From 13 February to 13 March 1794, Robespierre withdrew from active business on the Committee due to illness. On 15 March, he reappeared in the Convention. H\u00c3\u00a9bert and nineteen of his followers were arrested on 19 March and guillotined on 24 March. Danton, Desmoulins and their friends were arrested on 30 March and guillotined on 5 April.\n\ndoc779285: Reign of Terror. Several historians consider the \"reign of terror\" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September,[1] June[2] or March (birth of the Revolutionary Tribunal), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 (September Massacres), or even July 1789 (when the first lynchings took place),[3] but there is a consensus that it ended with the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794.[1][2]\n\ndoc491874: Jacobin. In July 1794, the government of Robespierre and allies was pushed out of power; Robespierre and 21 associates were executed. In November 1794, the Jacobin Club was closed.\n\ndoc515887: Caesarean section. The patron saint of Caesarean section is Caesarius of Africa, a young deacon martyred at Terracina, who has replaced and Christianized the pagan figure of Caesar.[105] The martyr (Saint Cesareo, in italian) is invoked for the good success of this surgical procedure.\n\ndoc463864: National Convention. But at the end of the winter of 1793-4, the shortage of food took a sharp turn for the worse. The Hebertists incited sans-culottes to demand stringent measures, and at first the Committee did prove conciliatory. The Convention voted 10 million for relief,[clarification needed] on 3 Ventose, Barere presented a new general Maximum, and on the 8th Saint-Just obtained a decree confiscating the property of suspects and distributing it to the needy (Ventose decrees). The Hebertists felt that if they increased the pressure, they would triumph once and for all. Although the call appeared like one for insurrection it was probably just for a new demonstration, like the one in September. But the Committee of Public Safety decided on 22 Ventose Year II (12 March 1794) that the Hebertists posed too serious a threat. The Committee linked Hebert, Ronsin, Vincent, and Momoro to the emigres Proli, Cloots and Pereira, so as to present the Hebertists as parties to the \"foreign plot\". All were executed on 4 Germinal (24 March).[48] This move largely silenced the Hebertists, now without their leadership. Having succeeded in stifling dissent on the left, the Committee then turned on the Dantonists, several members of which were implicated in financial corruption. The Committee forced the Convention to lift the parliamentary immunity of nine Dantonist deputies, allowing them to be put on trial. On 5 April Dantonist leaders Danton, Delacroix, Desmoulins, and Philippeaux were executed.[49]\n\ndoc2563488: Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. On hearing of Mountbatten's death, the then Master of the Queen's Music, Malcolm Williamson, was moved to write the Lament in Memory of Lord Mountbatten of Burma for violin and string orchestra. The 11\u00c2\u00a0minute work was given its first performance on 5 May 1980 by the Scottish Baroque Ensemble, conducted by Leonard Friedman.[126]\n\ndoc1728837: America's Critical Period. In 1785, Washington hosted the Mount Vernon Conference, which established an agreement between Maryland and Virginia regarding several commercial issues.

After the 1760s, regular concerts became a part of the cultural landscape, as well as a wide variety of dancing. Operatic excerpts began to appear, and before the end of the century Canada had its first home-grown opera.[4] A \"Concert Hall\" existed in Qu\u00e9bec by 1764 and subscription concerts by 1770, given, one may presume, by band players and skilled amateurs.[26] Programs for the Qu\u00e9bec and Halifax concerts of the 1790s reveal orchestral and chamber music by Handel, J.C. Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Pleyel.[5] Canada's first two operas were written, ca. 1790 and ca. 1808 by composer, poet, and playwright Joseph Quesnel (1746\u20131809).[27] The instrument of favour for the lower class was the fiddle. Fiddlers were a fixture in most public drinking establishments.[28] God Save the King/Queen has been sung in Canada since British rule and by the mid-20th century was, along with \"O Canada\", one of the country's two de facto national anthems.[29][30][31][32]\n\ndoc515895: Caesarean section. Self-inflicted caesarean section is the concept of a mother alone performing her own caesarean section. There have apparently been a few successful cases, notably In\u00e9s Ram\u00edrez P\u00e9rez of Mexico who in March 2000, performed a successful Caesarean section on herself.[125][126][127]\n\ndoc1279052: History of France.

After the fall of the monarchy, the revolutionary French government faced serious internal and external challenges, including the War of the First Coalition and insurrectionary War in the Vend\u00e9e. French revolutionary politicians believed a stable government was needed to quell the chaos.[17] On 11 March 1793, a Revolutionary Tribunal was established by Jacobins in the Convention.[54] On 6 April, Maximin Isnard and Georges Danton spearheaded the creation of a nine-member Committee of Public Safety to replace the larger Committee of General Defence. On 27 July 1793, Robespierre was elected to the Committee, although he had not sought the position.[55]\n\ndoc650942: 1st United States Congress. Held March 4, 1789, through September 29, 1789, at Federal Hall in New York City\n\ndoc1809196: A Survivor from Warsaw. The connection between conductor Serge Koussevitzsky\u2019s foundation and the Boston Symphony Orchestra led to the presumption that he and that orchestra would give the premiere, but Kurt Frederick, conductor of the Albuquerque Civic Symphony Orchestra, had heard about A Survivor from Warsaw and wrote to Schoenberg to ask permission to do the honors, and Schoenberg agreed, stipulating that in lieu of their performance fee the New Mexico musicians should prepare a full set of choral and orchestral parts and send those to him. The premiere was at first scheduled for Sept. 7, 1948, but was delayed until Nov. 4 of that year. Frederick conducted his orchestra at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque[2] with Sherman Smith as narrator. During the two-month delay, Koussevitzsky heard of Frederick\u2019s request and approved of the plan.[2]\n\ndoc740110: Committee of Public Safety. The Committee was initially composed of nine members, all selected by the National Convention for one month at a time, without term limits. Its first members, instated on 6 April 1793, were as follows, in order of election.\n\ndoc113601: French First Republic. Throughout the winter of 1792 and spring of 1793, Paris was plagued by food riots and mass hunger. The new Convention did little to remedy the problem until late spring of 1793, occupied instead with matters of war. Finally, on 6 April 1793, the Convention created the Committee of Public Safety, and was given a monumental task: \"To deal with the radical movements of the Enrag\u00e9s, food shortages and riots, the revolt in the Vend\u00e9e and in Brittany, recent defeats of its armies, and the desertion of its commanding general.\"[5] Most notably, the Committee of Public Safety instated a policy of terror, and the guillotine began to fall on perceived enemies of the republic at an ever-increasing rate, beginning the period known today as the Reign of Terror.[6]\n\ndoc1133961: French Directory. In July 1794, the members of the Convention began planning a new form of government and drafting a new Constitution, which would become the Constitution of the Year III (August 1795). An important aim was to prevent too much power from becoming concentrated in the hands of one man. One of the authors of the new Constitution, Fran\u00e7ois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas, wrote to the Convention:\n\ndoc740111: Committee of Public Safety. After Robespierre's election to the Committee on 27 July 1793, the Committee increased its membership to twelve. The list below represents the Committee's membership.\n\ndoc65211: French Revolution. This policy of price control was coeval with the Committee of Public Safety's rise to power and the Reign of Terror. The Committee first attempted to set the price for only a limited number of grain products but, by September 1793, it expanded the \"maximum\" to cover all foodstuffs and a long list of other goods.[119] Widespread shortages and famine ensued. The Committee reacted by sending dragoons into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize crops. This temporarily solved the problem in Paris, but the rest of the country suffered. By the spring of 1794, forced collection of food was not sufficient to feed even Paris and the days of the Committee were numbered. When Robespierre went to the guillotine in July of that year the crowd jeered, \"There goes the dirty maximum!\"[120]\n\ndoc1648468: Coronation of the British monarch. The music played at coronations has been primarily classical and religiously inspired. Much of the choral music uses texts from the Bible which have been used at coronations since King Edgar's coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for George\u00a0II's coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of Charles\u00a0II and Thomas Tomkins for Charles\u00a0I in 1621.[96]\n\ndoc591456: Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The division in France was at an all-time high when even families had different views on juring and non-juring priest.[13] The difference in families was primarily seen when the women would attend masses that where held by those who had defied the oath and men attended mass that was provided by clergymembers who had taken the oath.[13] It is important to note that even though priests who had not taken the Oath had the right to use the churches many were not allowed to use the buildings (this was done by priest who had sworn their allegiance) this furthermore demonstrated the division in the state.[13] On 29 November 1791, the Legislative Assembly, which had replaced the National Constituent Assembly, decreed that refractory priests could only exacerbate factionalism and aggravate extremists in the constituent assembly. The November 29th decree declared that no refractory priest could invoke the rights in the Constitution of the Clergy and that all such priests were suspect and so to be arrested. Louis XVI vetoed this decree (as he also did with another text concerning the creation of an army of 20,000 men on the orders of the Assembly, precipitating the monarchy's fall), which was toughened and re-issued a year later. Anti-Catholic persecution by the State would intensify into de-Christianization and propagation of the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being in 1793\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1794. During this time countless non-juring priests were interned in chains on prison ships in French harbors where most died within a few months from the appalling conditions.\n\ndoc619371: James Madison. Madison helped arrange the 1785 Mount Vernon Conference, which helped settle disputes regarding navigation rights on the Potomac River and also served as a model for future interstate conferences.[30] At the 1786 Annapolis Convention, he supported the calling of another convention to consider amending the Articles. After winning election to another term in Congress, Madison helped convince the other Congressmen to authorize the Philadelphia Convention for the purposes of proposing new amendments. But Madison had come to believe that the ineffectual Articles had to be superseded by a new constitution, and he began preparing for a convention that would propose an entirely new constitution.[31] Madison ensured that George Washington, who was popular throughout the country, and Robert Morris, who was influential in the critical state of Pennsylvania, would both broadly support Madison's plan to implement a new constitution.[32]\n\ndoc1648418: Coronation of the British monarch. A third recension was probably compiled during the reign of Henry\u00a0I and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a book of German liturgy compiled in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice.[2] It remained in use until the coronation of Edward\u00a0II in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ordo focussed on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings.[3] One manuscript of this recension is the Liber Regalis at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.[4]\n\ndoc838069: Joseph de Maistre. A member of the progressive Scottish Rite Masonic lodge at Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry from 1774 to 1790,[16] Maistre originally favoured political reform in France, supporting the efforts of the magistrates in the Parlements to force King Louis XVI to convene the Estates General. As a landowner in France, Maistre was eligible to join that body, and there is some evidence that he contemplated that possibility.[17] He was alarmed, however, by the decision of the States-General to combine clergy, aristocracy, and commoners into a single legislative body, which became the National Constituent Assembly. After the passing of the August Decrees on 4 August 1789 he decisively turned against the course of political events in France.[18]\n\ndoc591441: Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The Assembly passed the Civil Constitution on 12 July 1790, two days before the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. On that anniversary, the F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, Talleyrand and three hundred priests officiated at the \"altar of the nation\" erected on the Champ de Mars, wearing tricolor waistbands over their priestly vestments and calling down God's blessing upon the Revolution.\n\ndoc65230: French Revolution. Criteria for bringing someone before the Revolutionary Tribunal, created March 1793, had always been vast and vague.[135] By August, political disagreement seemed enough to be summoned before the Tribunal; appeal against a Tribunal verdict was impossible.[129] Late August 1793, an army general had been guillotined on the accusation of choosing too timid strategies on the battlefield.[129] Mid-October, the widowed former queen Marie Antoinette was on trial for a long list of charges such as \"teaching [her husband] Louis Capet the art of dissimulation\" and incest with her son, she too was guillotined.[129] In October 1793, 21 former 'Girondins' Convention members who hadn't left Paris after June were convicted to death and executed, on the charge of verbally supporting the preparation of an insurrection in Caen by fellow-Girondins.[129]\n\ndoc2352654: Silent film. Musical scores for early silent films were either improvised or compiled of classical or theatrical repertory music. Once full features became commonplace, however, music was compiled from photoplay music by the pianist, organist, orchestra conductor or the movie studio itself, which included a cue sheet with the film. These sheets were often lengthy, with detailed notes about effects and moods to watch for. Starting with the mostly original score composed by Joseph Carl Breil for D.\u00a0W. Griffith's groundbreaking epic The Birth of a Nation (1915), it became relatively common for the biggest-budgeted films to arrive at the exhibiting theater with original, specially composed scores.[14] However, the first designated full-blown scores had in fact been composed in 1908, by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns for The Assassination of the Duke of Guise,[15] and by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov for Stenka Razin.\n\ndoc2511458: Louis Antoine de Saint-Just. In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was initially unable to form a consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened.[51] By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report in the name of the Committee, and his damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins' trials must proceed, he said, and any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged on for months, but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to the guillotine on 31 October 1793.[52] Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers of arrest and punishment.[53]\n\ndoc1962851: Mount Vernon Conference. The conference was initially scheduled to begin March 21, 1785, in Alexandria, Virginia. Maryland delegates included Samuel Chase, Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, and Thomas Stone. From Virginia, Alexander Henderson and George Mason attended; James Madison and Edmund Randolph had been appointed but were not sufficiently notified of their appointments. None of Virginia's delegates were present when Maryland's arrived for the meeting.[1] George Washington, who had been corresponding with Thomas Stone about the conference,[6] offered them the hospitality of his Mount Vernon estate in Fairfax County, Virginia, while they waited, and then offered to host the gathering itself. Although not an official participant, Washington\u2014with his authoritative knowledge of the issues and active interest in Potomac navigation\u2014inspired the delegates and lent considerable prestige to the proceedings.[1]\n\ndoc2096118: Cello Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns). The work can be split into three different sections as follows:\n\ndoc1331544: Columbia University. On May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Dr. Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected President of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[38] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President George Washington and Vice President John Adams attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.[39]\n\ndoc1596663: Maximilien Robespierre. The same day, 28 July 1794, in the afternoon, Robespierre was guillotined without trial in the Place de la R\u00e9volution. His brother Augustin, Couthon, Saint-Just, Hanriot, and twelve other followers, among them the cobbler Antoine Simon, the jailor of Louis-Charles, Dauphin of France, were also executed.[85] When clearing Robespierre's neck, the executioner tore off the bandage that was holding his shattered jaw in place, causing Robespierre to produce an agonised scream until the fall of the blade silenced him.[86] Together with those executed with him, he was buried in a common grave at the newly opened Errancis Cemetery[87] (near what is now the Place Prosper-Goubaux). A plaque indicating the former site of this cemetery is located at 97 rue de Monceau, Paris. Between 1844 and 1859 (probably in 1848), the remains of all those buried there were moved to the Catacombs of Paris.\n\ndoc1575341: Book of Common Prayer. The Episcopal Church separated itself from the Church of England in 1789, the first church in the USA having been founded in 1607.(Cross & Livingstone 1975) Its prayer book, published in 1790, had as its sources the 1662 English book and the 1764 Scottish Liturgy (see above) which Bishop Seabury of Connecticut had brought over following his consecration in Aberdeen in 1784, containing elements of each (Perry 1922). The preface to the 1789 Book of Common Prayer says, \"this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doctrine, discipline, or worship...further than local circumstances require.\" There were some notable differences. For example, in the Communion service the prayer of consecration follows mainly the Scottish orders derived from 1549 (Shepherd 1965, 82) and found in the 1764 Book of Common Prayer. The compilers used materials derived from ancient liturgies especially Eastern Orthodox ones such as the Liturgy of St. James.(Shepherd 1965, 82) An epiclesis was included, as in the Scottish book, though modified to meet reformist objections. Overall, the book was modelled on the English Prayer Book, the Convention having resisted attempts at deletion and revision.(McGarvey & Gibson 1907) The 1789 American BCP reintroduced explicit sacrificial language in the Prayer of Consecration by adding the words \"which we now offer unto Thee\", after \"with these thy holy gifts\" from the 1549 BCP. The insertion undid Cranmer's rejection of the Eucharist as a material sacrifice by which the Church offers itself to God in an unbloody liturgical representation in and with the very same sacrifice of Christ who is both priest and victim, both offering and offered. This reworking thereby aligned the church's eucharistic theology more closely to that of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches.\n\ndoc463902: National Convention. The article on the Convention in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica concludes, \"The work of the Convention was immense in all branches of public affairs. To appreciate it without prejudice, one should recall that this assembly saved France from a civil war and invasion, that it founded the system of public education (Museum, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00c9cole des langues orientales, Conservatoire), created institutions of capital importance, like that of the Grand Livre de la Dette publique, and definitely established the social and political gains of the Revolution.\" By a decree of 4 February 1794 (16 pluvi\u00f4se) it also ratified and expanded to the whole French colonial empire the 1793 abolition of slavery on Saint-Domingue by civil commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel, though this did not affect Martinique or Guadeloupe and was abolished by the law of 20 May 1802.\n\ndoc1399010: French Revolution from the summer of 1790 to the establishment of the Legislative Assembly. The close of the Assembly was set for 29 September 1791.\n\ndoc1422871: Canadian Confederation. The original Fathers of Confederation are those delegates who attended any of the conferences held at Charlottetown and Quebec in 1864, or in London, United Kingdom, in 1866, leading to Confederation.[74]\n\ndoc916599: John Hanson. The Articles of Confederation stipulated that presidents of Congress serve one-year terms, and Hanson became the first to do so.[1][19] [20] Contrary to the claims of some of his later advocates, however, he was not the first president to serve under the Articles, nor the first to be elected under the Articles.[21] When the Articles went into effect in March 1781, Congress did not bother to elect a new president; instead, Samuel Huntington continued serving a term that had already exceeded a year.[22] On July 9, 1781, Samuel Johnston became the first man to be elected as president of Congress after the ratification of the Articles.[23] He declined the office, however, perhaps to make himself available for North Carolina's gubernatorial election.[24] After Johnston turned down the office, Thomas McKean was elected.[25][22] McKean served just a few months, resigning in October 1781 after hearing news of the British surrender at Yorktown. Congress asked him to remain in office until November, when a new session of Congress was scheduled to begin.[19] It was in that session that Hanson began to serve his one-year term. A highlight of Hanson's term was when George Washington presented Cornwallis's sword to Congress.[26]\n\ndoc1223937: Whiskey Rebellion. In October 1794, Washington traveled west to review the progress of the military expedition. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was \"the first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\".[99] Jonathan Forman led the Third Infantry Regiment of New Jersey troops against the Whiskey Rebellion, he wrote about his encounter with Washington:[100]\n\ndoc1279051: History of France. Maximilien Robespierre, since July 1793 member of the Committee of Public Prosperity,[66] on 5 February 1794 in a speech in the Convention identified Jacques H\u00e9bert and his faction as \"internal enemies\" working toward the triumph of tyranny. After a dubious trial H\u00e9bert and some allies were guillotined in March.[68] On 5 April, again at the instigation of Robespierre, Danton and 13 associated politicians were executed. A week later again 19 politicians. This hushed the Convention deputies: if henceforth they disagreed with Robespierre they hardly dared to speak out.[68] A law enacted on 10 June 1794 (22 Prairial II) further streamlined criminal procedures: if the Revolutionary Tribunal saw sufficient proof of someone being an \"enemy of the people\" a counsel for defence would not be allowed. The frequency of guillotine executions in Paris now rose from on average three a day to an average of 29 a day.[68]\n\ndoc515872: Caesarean section. The World Health Organization officially withdrew its previous recommendation of a 15% C-section rate in June 2010. Their official statement read, \"There is no empirical evidence for an optimum percentage. What matters most is that all women who need caesarean sections receive them.\"[84]\n\ndoc2512357: John Jay. The Court's business through its first three years primarily involved the establishment of rules and procedure; reading of commissions and admission of attorneys to the bar; and the Justices' duties in \"riding circuit,\" or presiding over cases in the circuit courts of the various federal judicial districts. No convention existed that precluded the involvement of Supreme Court Justices in political affairs, and Jay used his light workload as a Justice to freely participate in the business of Washington's administration. He used his circuit riding to spread word throughout the states of Washington's commitment to neutrality, then published reports of French minister Edmond-Charles Genet's campaign to win American support for France. However, Jay also established an early precedent for the Court's independence in 1790, when Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton wrote to Jay requesting the Court's endorsement of legislation that would assume the debts of the states. Jay replied that the Court's business was restricted to ruling on the constitutionality of cases being tried before it and refused to allow it to take a position either for or against the legislation.[71]\n\ndoc2213310: Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven). The British premiere was presented on 21 March 1825 by its commissioners, the Philharmonic Society of London, at its Argyll Rooms conducted by Sir George Smart and with the choral part sung in Italian. The American premiere was presented on 20 May 1846 by the newly formed New York Philharmonic at Castle Garden (in an attempt to raise funds for a new concert hall), conducted by the English-born George Loder with the choral part translated into English for the first time.\n\ndoc515828: Caesarean section. There are number of steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of adhesions. Such techniques and principles may include:\n\n"
