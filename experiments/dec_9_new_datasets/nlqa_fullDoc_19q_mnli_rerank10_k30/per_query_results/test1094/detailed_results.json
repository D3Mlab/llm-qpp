The law was introduced to the New Zealand Parliament as a private members bill by Green Party Member of Parliament Sue Bradford in 2005, after being drawn from the ballot. It drew intense debate, both in Parliament and from the public. The bill was colloquially referred to by several of its opponents and newspapers as the \"anti-smacking bill\".[1] The bill was passed on its third reading on 16 May 2007 by 113 votes to eight.[2][3] The Governor-General of New Zealand granted the bill Royal Assent on 21 May 2007, and the law came into effect on 21 June 2007.\n\ndoc38371: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. On March 24, 2017, it was Reported that New Zealand First and Winston Peters will take to the election a policy of repeal the anti-smacking law passed by the last parliament. They will not enter any coalition or confidence and supply agreement with a party that wishes to ignore the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly stated view in a referendum on that issue after the New Zealand general election, 2017[35]\n\ndoc806030: Gun laws in New Zealand. The two major anti-gun groups in recent years have been the Coalition for Gun Control, and Gunsafe NZ. Neither is still active, but were led by activist Philip Alpers and Mike Meyrick, a former police officer and lawyer.[15]\n\ndoc806025: Gun laws in New Zealand. The New Zealand Police administer and enforce the Arms Act 1983.[7] They are issued Bushmaster XM-15 semi-automatic rifles, Glock 17 gen 4 pistols, and Tasers, which are normally carried in patrol cars and not on the officers.[8]\n\ndoc1513188: Gangs in New Zealand. A law banning gang patches from government and public buildings was introduced in 2012 by National MP Todd McClay.[73] Police welcomed the law,[74]\n\ndoc806016: Gun laws in New Zealand. An internal police report in 1982 criticised the proposals, saying there was no evidence that registration of guns helped to solve crimes, and that registration would use time and money better spent on other police work. This policy was adopted by the government in the 1983 Act.[5]\n\ndoc806031: Gun laws in New Zealand. The main parties, Labour and National, generally treat gun control as a bi-partisan issue. Both support the passage of the Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill[citation needed].\n\ndoc806004: Gun laws in New Zealand. C Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Restricted weapons\n\ndoc806028: Gun laws in New Zealand. The Sporting Shooters Association of New Zealand is a part-time lobby group that is usually only active at elections and when there are government calls for gun control laws. It is smaller than COLFO.\n\ndoc1862081: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Criminal Justice The Act requires that everyone who is charged with an offence:\n\ndoc1862078: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Everyone who is arrested or who is detained has the right to:\n\ndoc806020: Gun laws in New Zealand. The law also created the new category of \"military-style semi-automatic\", which like the Federal Assault Weapons Ban two years later in the United States, mainly covered the appearance rather than the functionality of the guns. These required a special endorsement, security and registration in the same manner as pistols, but could be used wherever A-category guns could.\n\ndoc805996: Gun laws in New Zealand. In March 2009 the New Zealand police bid to reclassify certain types of civilian semi-automatic firearms was overturned by the New Zealand High Court as a result of a legal challenge mounted by the New Zealand National Shooters Association (NSA) president Richard Lincoln.\n\ndoc805997: Gun laws in New Zealand. Gun laws in New Zealand are notably more liberal than other countries in the Pacific and focus mainly on vetting firearm owners, rather than registering firearms or banning certain types of firearms.[4] Firearms legislation is provided for in the Arms Act and its associated regulations, though stricter unofficial police and government policies also apply[citation needed].\n\ndoc1897168: Alcohol in New Zealand. Laws for M\ud6eeori\nThe first laws prohibiting M\ud6eeori people from consuming alcohol in New Zealand were established between 1847 and 1878. Laws were passed due to the common belief the M\ud6eeori were susceptible to alcohol abuse.[7]\n\ndoc2669994: Speed limits in New Zealand. Although there is no minimum posted speed limit, it is illegal to drive at an \"unreasonably slow speed\" which means slow drivers are required by law to pull over to the side of the road to allow queues of cars behind them to pass. The police can and do enforce this law in which the offending driver is given anything from an NZ$150 infringement notice for Inconsiderate Driving to possibly an indictment for careless driving which is usually dealt with by the Courts.\n\ndoc806022: Gun laws in New Zealand. The government decided to order another report, this time led by former judge Thomas Thorp. The report was released in 1997 and called for many new restrictions on legal gun ownership, including banning various features, and that all guns be registered (the last particularly unpopular with firearm owners).\n\ndoc2317548: Treason. New Zealand has treason laws that are stipulated under the Crimes Act 1961. Section 73 of the Crimes Act reads as follows:\n\ndoc1862079: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Everyone who is arrested for an offence has the right to be charged promptly or to be released. Everyone who is arrested or detained for any offence or suspected offence shall have the right to:\n\ndoc806017: Gun laws in New Zealand. The 1983 Arms Act abandoned registration for most long guns, as Parliament felt it was prohibitively expensive and not particularly useful. The philosophy of the new system was to control users, rather than firearms. Police were required to conduct a background check before a licence would be issued (though existing owners would be issued a licence automatically), but once a person had a licence there was no requirement to register long guns or obtain a permit-to-procure when they were sold or lent.\n\ndoc806013: Gun laws in New Zealand. Firearms first arrived in New Zealand with European traders and were traded in large numbers to the native M\u0101ori. This lead partly to the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. The first gun control laws were enacted in 1845, but early regulations were ineffective until the passage of the Arms Act in 1860, which required licences and registration of firearms and firearm dealers. Early laws were mainly targeted at M\u0101ori during the land wars in the Waikato and Taranaki, and were largely suspended at the end of the 1880s. By about 1910 the laws were ignored and unenforced, as crime and the threat of political unrest were minimal.\n\ndoc806023: Gun laws in New Zealand. The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1790286: Citizen's arrest. Specifically, the Crimes Act 1961 states that everyone (not just New Zealand citizens) is justified in arresting without warrant:[42]\n\ndoc806026: Gun laws in New Zealand. The New Zealand Police Association, the police union / service association, has repeatedly lobbied for greater access to firearms for police officers.[9][10][11] As well as stricter regulations on licensed firearm owners.[12][13][14]\n\ndoc1862098: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The resistance to an entrenched bill of rights in New Zealand is because the country is governed by parliamentary sovereignty. Giving the courts the power to strike down Parliament\u2019s legislation would be contrary to the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy.[28] There is also resistance because the protection of human rights is not the courts\u2019 responsibility and should involve all branches of government.[29]\n\ndoc806018: Gun laws in New Zealand. Special restrictions applied to restricted weapons and pistols, which needed to be registered. Self-defence was no longer a valid reason to have a pistol (although the Crimes Act 1961 states a person can use \"reasonable force\" to defend oneself and/or one's property, and nowhere in this act states a person cannot use a firearm for such purposes, while the arms act does not mention \"directly in words\" one cannot use a firearm for self-defence), but the new sport of target pistol shooting has become more popular, and pistol club shooters can own pistols with a special \"B\" endorsement.\n\ndoc806033: Gun laws in New Zealand. The Green Party supports an increase in legislative restrictions on public access to firearms.[16] The Greens policies include the full ban of private ownership of all semi automatic firearms and the reintroduction of a national firearms registry.[17]\n\ndoc673527: Public intoxication. In New Zealand, drinking in public is not a crime and instead, local governments must specify that alcohol is banned in an area before it is considered a crime to drink in that location. Being drunk in public is not specifically an offense unless the person who is intoxicated is a public nuisance, in which case they may be dealt with for 'disturbing the peace'. This will usually result in being taken home, or otherwise taken to a police cell until sober.\n\ndoc2173071: New Zealand\u2013United Kingdom relations. A number of these acts were repealed through the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989.[10]\n\ndoc806008: Gun laws in New Zealand. E Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Military-style semi-automatics\n\ndoc806011: Gun laws in New Zealand. This class allows a person working for a dealer to demonstrate a pistol, military-style semi-automatic or a collectable weapon without having to have that class of licence. They can demonstrate one but not possess one for personal use. This is not a well known endorsement\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A large number of cases have been heard under the Act since it was passed in 1990, mostly pertaining to rights around arrest and detention.\n\ndoc1152406: Road rage. In New Zealand, Road Rage in itself is not an offence,[13] but Drivers are usually charged with other offences committed during an act of road rage (usually assault or unlawful possession of an offensive weapon). Drivers have a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid endangerment of human life when operating a vehicle (s 156 Crimes Act 1961); failure to discharge this duty, such as an act of aggressive driving, can give rise to liability in criminal nuisance (s 146 Crimes Act 1961). Ramming a vehicle constitutes intentional or reckless damage to property, a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment (s 269 Crimes Act 1961). New Zealand courts currently have no powers to disqualify drivers who physically assault another road user.[citation needed]\n\ndoc76451: Politics of New Zealand. New Zealand law has three principal sources: English common law, certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689), and statutes of the New Zealand Parliament.[33] In interpreting common law, the courts have endeavoured to preserve uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions.[34]\n\ndoc1513186: Gangs in New Zealand. Some politicians have called for gang patches to be made illegal.[68][69][70]\n\ndoc38340: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. A citizens-initiated referendum on the issues surrounding the law was held between 30 July and 21 August 2009, asking \"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\" Despite widespread criticism of the question's wording, the referendum was returned with an 87.4 percent \"No\" vote on a turnout of 56.1 percent.\n\ndoc806027: Gun laws in New Zealand. The Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO) was set up in 1996.\n\ndoc806003: Gun laws in New Zealand. B Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Target (competition) pistols\n\ndoc806005: Gun laws in New Zealand. Pistols can also be held on the C endorsement instead of the B. Common special reasons include:\n\ndoc516910: Cannabis in New Zealand. The use of cannabis in New Zealand is governed by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, which makes unauthorised possession of any amount of cannabis illegal. There are political efforts to remove penalties on its use for those over 18 years of age. In October 2017, following the ascension of a Labour/Green/New Zealand First coalition to government, the Greens announced a nationwide referendum of the legality of cannabis for both medical and personal use.\n\ndoc806029: Gun laws in New Zealand. The National Shooters Association is a nationwide civilian gun owners association that took the forefront in a 2009 legal challenge against unauthorised police interference with gun regulations. Its executive is largely made up of former members of the Practical Shooting Institute, a predecessor group which had similar success bringing court action against Police interference in 1990.\n\ndoc806021: Gun laws in New Zealand. After two shootings by police in 1995, the government ordered an inquiry into police procedures for storing and using firearms. Before the review started, massacres overseas at Dunblane and Port Arthur led the government to expand the scope to gun control generally. The police reported that the system was sound and that no major changes were needed.\n\ndoc1049514: History of rugby union in New Zealand. Two games had to be cancelled.[8] The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at Timaru was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.[8]\n\ndoc805998: Gun laws in New Zealand. Firearms in New Zealand fall into one of four categories:\n\ndoc2661844: Wasting police time. In New Zealand, one can be charged under Section 24 of the Summary Offences Act 1981[4] for committing either of the following acts:\n\ndoc40110: Legal issues in airsoft. Legislation, New Zealand, Arms Act 1983, retrieved 15 July 2014\u00c2\n\ndoc518316: Freedom of speech by country. The right to freedom of speech is not explicitly protected by common law in New Zealand, but is encompassed in a wide range of doctrines aimed at protecting free speech.[69] An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press.[70] In particular, freedom of expression is preserved in section 14 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (BORA) which states that:\n\ndoc2300292: Sedition. Following a recommendation from the New Zealand Law Commission,[33] the New Zealand government announced on 7 May 2007 that the sedition law would be repealed.[34] The Crimes (Repeal of Seditious Offences) Amendment Act 2007 was passed on 24 October 2007, and entered into force on 1 January 2008.[35]\n\ndoc806014: Gun laws in New Zealand. Strikes in 1912 and 1913, a Communist revolution in Russia, and large numbers of ex-military guns coming into the country after World War I were used as justification for a new law in 1920. The new law required the registration of all firearms and issuance of a \"permit to procure\" before a firearm was transferred. Semi-automatic pistols were banned and a special permit was needed for other pistols (e.g. revolvers), with the intent of discouraging the carrying of concealed weapons. Few changes were seen for the next forty years as crime remained low and the country avoided political violence.\n\ndoc806024: Gun laws in New Zealand. In August 2009, the Police decided that any firearm, including single shot bolt action rifles, with a free-standing pistol grip that could allow the firearm to be shot inaccurately from the hip would be defined as an MSSA.[6] However, the High Court rejected this attempt in Lincoln v Police [2010] BCL 194; 33 TCL 11/2.\n\ndoc2145434: Law of New Zealand. Another problem with the idea that the Treaty established the rule of British law is that in 1840 M\ud6eeori still controlled New Zealand. Although the British had sent a governor, they had not backed him up with troops and for the first few years of supposed British sovereignty, Europeans were significantly outnumbered and outgunned by M\ud6eeori. M\ud6eeori generally obeyed British law in European settlements and when they or their chiefs chose to, but there was nothing to make them obey the law in areas they controlled, which until about the 1860s was most of the country. British law, and later New Zealand law as passed by the New Zealand parliament was slowly established over the country, but it remained ineffective in M\ud6eeori-controlled areas until the late nineteenth century at least. In practical terms, British-based law was established in New Zealand not through the Treaty of Waitangi but through conquest and settlement.\n\ndoc806007: Gun laws in New Zealand. For those that make an income from firearms. To sell restricted weapons the dealer also needs to have the appropriate endorsements.\n\ndoc1897169: Alcohol in New Zealand. For over a century, from the 1847 laws to 1948, M\u0101ori were restricted to buying alcohol from off-licensed vendors. In 1948 Parliament repealed most discriminatory measures, in part due to pressure from M\u0101ori servicemen returning from war.[7]\n\ndoc805999: Gun laws in New Zealand. Registration is not required under the law but the police carry out a regime similar to registration for all but \"A Category\" firearms. Firearms in any other category require a \"permit to procure\" before they are transferred.\n\ndoc38364: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The first petition was supported by Family First New Zealand, the ACT Party[28] and The Kiwi Party.[26]\n\ndoc466193: School corporal punishment. Corporal punishment in New Zealand schools was abolished in 1987, but wasn't abolished legislatively until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or ECE provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control.[108] Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in termination and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.[109]\n\ndoc253: Tobacco advertising. Tobacco advertising in New Zealand was outlawed with the passage of the Smokefree Amendment Act 1990.\n\ndoc667029: Legal tender. New Zealand has a complex history of legal tender. English law applied, as applicable to local circumstances, from either 6 January 1840, when the Governor of New South Wales by proclamation annexed New Zealand, or from 14 January 1840 when Captain Hobson Royal Navy was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor. The English Laws Act 1858 subsequently confirmed that English legislation passed prior to 14 January 1840 was and had been the law of New Zealand, as applicable to local circumstances. The (UK) Coinage Act 1816 therefore applied and British coins were confirmed as legal tender in New Zealand. Unusually, until 1989, the Reserve Bank did not have the right to issue coins as legal tender. Coins had to be issued by the Minister of Finance.\n\ndoc30318: Flag of New Zealand. In March 1994 the Prime Minister of New Zealand Jim Bolger made statements supporting a move towards a New Zealand republic.[17] In response Christian Democrat MP Graeme Lee introduced a Flags, Anthems, Emblems, and Names Protection Amendment Bill.[18] If passed, the Bill would have entrenched the Act that governs the flag and added New Zealand's anthems, requiring a majority of 65 percent of votes in Parliament before any future legislation could change the flag. The Bill passed its first reading but was defeated at its second reading, 26 votes to 37.\n\ndoc1897167: Alcohol in New Zealand. The liquor laws of New Zealand begin with the Colonisation of New Zealand and the implementation of English Common Law to New Zealand between 1840 and 1842, when New Zealand was jurisdictionally part of the Colony of New South Wales.[7]\n\ndoc1664411: New Zealanders. Agitation regarding Treaty of Waitangi violations intensified in the 1970s. The Waitangi Tribunal was set up in 1975 to consider alleged breaches, and in 1984 was empowered to look back to 1840.[47]\n\ndoc1324332: Capital punishment in New Zealand. Capital punishment in New Zealand first appeared in a codified form when it became a British territory in 1840, and was first employed in 1842.[1] It was last used in 1957, abolished for murder in 1961, and abolished altogether, including for treason, in 1989. During the period that it was in effect, 85 people were executed.\n\ndoc38354: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The law change has been described by supporters as aimed at making 'Aotearoa New Zealand [\u2026] a place where children are secure, confident, understand limits and boundaries and behave well \u2013 without physical punishment' and to 'protect children from assault'.[14]\n\ndoc38351: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. Bradford considers that smacking was illegal even before the Act was passed.[10] When an illegal activity is reported to the Police or to Child Youth and Family (CYF), they are required to investigate the reported abuse. Under subsection 4, The Police have the option of not prosecuting the parents 'where the offence is considered to be so inconsequential that there is no public interest in proceeding with a prosecution.'\n\ndoc1862075: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The Act also (Section 18(4)) ensures that non-New Zealand citizens lawfully in New Zealand shall not be required to leave except under a decision taken on grounds prescribed by law.\n\ndoc805994: Gun laws in New Zealand. Gun licenses are issued at the discretion of the police in New Zealand provided the police consider the person to be of good standing and without criminal, psychiatric or drug issues as well as meeting other conditions such as having suitable storage facilities. To be issued, they must be issued for a valid reason, which may not include self defense. Several different categories of licenses are permitted, with the lowest one permitting access to restricted semi-automatic rifles and shotguns, with limited capacity, while the higher levels which permit fully automatic weaponry and pistols are rarely issued to civilians.\n\ndoc1772171: Military history of New Zealand during World War II. The military history of New Zealand during World War II began when New Zealand entered the Second World War by declaring war on Nazi Germany with Great Britain. The state of war with Germany was officially held to have existed since 9:30 pm on 3 September 1939 (local time), simultaneous with that of Britain, but in fact the declaration of war was not made until confirmation had been received from Britain that their ultimatum to Germany had expired. The group (led by Peter Fraser as Prime Minister Mickey Savage was terminally ill) listened to the shortwave radio in Carl Berendsen's room in Parliament Buildings but were not certain what Neville Chamberlain had said because of static on the short-wave radio, and a coded telegraph message from London did not arrive until just before midnight as the messenger boy with the telegram in London took shelter because of a (false) air-raid warning. The Cabinet acted after hearing the Admiralty's notification to the fleet that war had broken out. The next day Cabinet approved nearly 30 war regulations as laid down in the War Book, and after completing the formalities with the Executive Council the Governor-General, Lord Galway, issued the Proclamation of War, backdated to 9.30 pm on 3 September.[1][2]\n\ndoc38355: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The first conviction under the new law occurred on 22 November 2007.[15] In the first five years of the law (June 2007 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c June 2012) there were eight prosecutions for smacking.[16][17]\n\ndoc1862095: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Several other remedies were suggested to be available in R v Taylor (1996) 14 CRNZ 426. These included a reduction in the penalty, police disciplinary proceedings, criminal prosecution, a declaration, or future-looking relief.[21] Other remedies have included special jury directions, and orders that witness testimony be disregarded.[22] It can often depend on the nature of the right breached as to what remedy will be appropriate to vindicate that breach.[23]\n\ndoc1324350: Capital punishment in New Zealand. Occasional calls to reinstate capital punishment still occur, but no major political party has made capital punishment an element of any of their election manifestos since the 1989 Abolition act.\n\ndoc2345864: Health care in New Zealand. Abortion is legal in New Zealand, if certain criteria are met. In general, either the health of the pregnant woman or the foetus must be in jeopardy. Additionally, two doctors must give their consent to the procedure. There were 18,380 abortions carried out in 2007, following a general increase in both the absolute number and per capita rate since 1991.\n\ndoc1049511: History of rugby union in New Zealand. The 1981 Springbok Tour, or The Tour, went down as one of the most controversial rugby tours ever. From July to September, the Springboks toured New Zealand. Rugby fans filled the stadiums, yet equal numbers of fans protested the games outside the stadiums. Police were divided into Red and Blue riot squads for the tour, and in preparation for possible trouble, all spectators were told to assemble in sports grounds at least an hour before kickoff. At a game at Rugby Park in Hamilton, around 350 protesters pulled down a fence and invaded the pitch. Police, already very worried, pulled the match when they found out a light plane piloted by a protester was headed to fly around the stadium. A protest turned violent in Wellington the following week, escalating the situation. During the final test match at Eden Park, a low flying plane dropped flour bombs over the pitch. These images were beamed around the world, and looked as though a civil crisis had engulfed New Zealand. A subsequent 1985 All Black tour was prevented by the High Court, but an unofficial tour took place the following year.\n\ndoc2295140: Auckland Harbour Bridge. The protest created a wide spectrum of responses in the media and in public perception, from being labelled a dangerous stunt representative of an increasingly lawless, anarchic society[50] to being considered a successful signal to authorities to give more weight to the demands and the public backing of the walk and cycleway proponents. Authorities noted that they were investigating whether any of the protesters would face fines or charges.[51] NZTA representatives noted that they were disappointed at what they considered the broken word of the organisers of the protest, and remarked that it would take 30 more years before walking and cycling could likely be provided (see also \"Second Harbour Crossing\" below).[49] NZTA were criticised as having brought the situation at least partly onto themselves by choosing the easy route of forbidding the protest crossing.[50] Several political protest marches (especially hikois) had been allowed to cross the bridge.\n\ndoc1862097: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. It is an on-going conversation amongst legal academics in New Zealand as to whether there should be an entrenched constitutional bill of rights that gives the court the power to strike down inconsistent legislation.[25] This would provide a remedy to breaches of the Bill of Rights Act 1990 as the courts could uphold the right, rather than finding it to be subservient under s4. The UN Human Rights Committee criticised New Zealand for the lack of court power to strike down legislation inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act 1990. They equated this lack of power with a lack of human rights protection[26] Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler published a book in 2016 entitled A Constitution for Aotearoa New Zealand[27] that laid out a proposed entrenched bill of rights, including a judicial power of strike down. This was intended to start a conversation in New Zealand as to whether entrenching their bill of rights in a constitution was the way forward.\n\ndoc159166: Drunk driving law by country. New Zealand operates a program called Compulsory Breath Testing, which allows police to stop motorists at any time. CBT is usually carried out at roadside checkpoints but mobile patrol cars can also randomly stop motorists to administer a test. The police also carry out roadside drug tests upon motorists they suspect have used drugs.[90]\n\ndoc806010: Gun laws in New Zealand. F Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Dealers staff licence\n\ndoc323122: Overview of gun laws by nation. New Zealand's gun laws comprise the Arms Act of 1983,[147]\nArms Amendment Act 1992,[148]\nand Arms Regulations 1992,[149]\nand focus mainly on vetting firearm owners. A firearms licence may be issued by police to applicants who attend a safety lecture, pass a written test on safety and the Arms Code, and have secure storage for firearms and ammunition; the police will also interview the applicant and two references to be certain the applicant is \"fit and proper\" to own a firearm. Having criminal associations, a history of domestic violence, mental instability, or alcohol or drug abuse almost always result in the application being denied. Misbehavior involving firearms commonly leads to a firearms licence being revoked by police. Even when licensed, a person may only be in possession of a firearm for a particular lawful, proper and sufficient purpose,[150]\nwhich the NZ Police claim specifically excludes self-defence, however this is not written in the Arms Act or supporting regulations.[151]\n\ndoc1513187: Gangs in New Zealand. In 2009 the Wanganui District Council voted to ban gang patches, but it was overturned following a judicial review instigated by the Hells Angels.[71] The council tried again in 2011, this time restricting the ban to just the central business district, malls and parks.[72]\n\ndoc1862087: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A common remedy to the Bill of Rights Act 1990 is that the evidence obtained through breaching a right is inadmissible in court. This developed in the courts as a presumption of exclusion but was then lessened to a balancing exercise where various factors are weighed up to determine the admissibility of evidence tainted by a breach of the Bill of Rights Act 1990.[7] This remedy is now reflected in section 30 of the Evidence Act 2006.[8]\n\ndoc1862082: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Fair Trial Everyone who is charged with an offence has the minimum right:\n\ndoc40106: Legal issues in airsoft. Air-powered firearms are legal to possess and use in New Zealand, provided that the person is either over 18 years of age or 16 with a firearms license. A person under 18 may not possess an air gun, but may use one under the direct supervision of someone over 18 or a firearms license holder (Direct supervision requires that the license holder be able to take control of the firearm at all times, so they must remain within arms reach).\n\ndoc805993: Gun laws in New Zealand. About 230,000 licensed firearms owners own and use New Zealand's estimated 1.1 million firearms.[1] As in Australia, but unlike the US and Canada, gun laws usually gain the support of both major parties before they are passed. Guns are not currently a major political issue, but have been immediately after the Aramoana massacre in 1990, and the Scottish Dunblane and Australian Port Arthur massacres in 1996.\n\ndoc2317551: Treason. Very few people have been prosecuted for the act of treason in New Zealand and none have been prosecuted in recent years.[21]\n\ndoc2410390: New Zealand nuclear-free zone. Initial seeds were sown for New Zealand's 1987 nuclear free zone legislation in the late 1950s with the formation of the local Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) organisation between 1957 and 1959.[9][10] In 1959, responding to rising public concern following the British hydrogen bomb tests in Australia and the Pacific, New Zealand voted in the UN to condemn nuclear testing while the UK, US and France voted against, and Australia abstained.[11] In 1961, CND urged the New Zealand government to declare that it would not acquire or use nuclear weapons and to withdraw from nuclear alliances such as ANZUS. In 1963, the Auckland CND campaign submitted its 'No Bombs South of the Line' petition to the New Zealand parliament with 80,238 signatures calling on the government to sponsor an international conference to discuss establishing a nuclear-free-zone in the southern hemisphere. It was the biggest petition in the nation since the one in 1893 which demanded that women must have the right to vote.[12]\n\ndoc2020110: Graffiti. In February 2008 Helen Clark, the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in Auckland during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of manslaughter.\n\ndoc1049521: History of rugby union in New Zealand. New Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with South Africa, especially through rugby union. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against M\u0101ori players, since the apartheid political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that M\u0101ori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being M\u0101ori, this was agreed to, and M\u0101ori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some M\u0101ori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at M\u0101ori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group Halt All Racist Tours was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which M\u0101ori were central, and M\u0101ori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by P\u0101keh\u0101 (white New Zealanders).\n\ndoc952715: Islam in New Zealand. In 2006, two newspapers in New Zealand decided to republish controversial Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. The Muslim community registered their displeasure through press statements and a small peaceful march in Auckland. The editors said they did not mean offence but would not back down. Prime Minister Helen Clark and opposition leader Don Brash both made statements that the cartoons were not appreciated if they deeply offended members of the New Zealand community, but that such decisions were for editors to make, not politicians. Muslim leaders and the editors got together with the Race Relations office, and Jewish and Christian representatives in Wellington. As a result of this meeting the editors said they would not apologise but in good faith would refrain from publishing the offending images again. The New Zealand Muslim leadership, through the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIAN]Z, then proceeded in good faith to consider the matter closed, and drafted letters to 52 Muslim countries reversing their earlier stance and asking that New Zealand products not be boycotted.[18][19]\n\ndoc2317549: Treason. Every one owing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand commits treason who, within or outside New Zealand,\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\n\ndoc2222778: New Zealand nationality law. This law has been controversial. A 2003 petition asking the Parliament of New Zealand to repeal the Act attracted 100,000 signatures, and the Samoan rights group Mau Sitiseni filed a petition on the issue with the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2007.[6]\n\ndoc1049519: History of rugby union in New Zealand. The role of the NZ police also became more controversial as a result of the tour.\n\ndoc1310356: New Zealand national rugby union team. The 1981 South African tour to New Zealand sparked protests against South Africa's apartheid policy, the likes of which had not been seen in New Zealand since the 1951 waterfront dispute.[67][68] The NZRU had invited the Springboks to tour as the Muldoon government refused to involve politics in sport.[69] Although New Zealand won the test series, two of the tour's provincial games were cancelled and the whole tour was marred by violence and protest.[70] The third and final test match of the tour is sometimes known as the Flour Bomb test, as an anti-apartheid activist in a Cessna light aircraft dropped leaflets, flares, a parachute-supported banner reading \"Biko\" and flour bombs into Auckland's Eden Park throughout the match, felling a New Zealand player. During the tour the country experienced unrest, and the tour had a significant impact on New Zealand society.[67][70][71]\n\ndoc806009: Gun laws in New Zealand. New class of restricted weapon that was created after the Aramoana shooting spree. At the time anyone with an MSSA that wanted to keep it in that configuration was given a E endorsement (after going through the vetting and extra security requirements). But presently few are issued. Common reasons for wanting an E endorsement are professional pest destruction, collecting, 3-gun and service rifle shooting. Those people that did not want the extra hassle and expense of the endorsement converted their rifles into 'A' configuration by removing the components that made it an 'E'.\n\ndoc430006: History of New Zealand. Feminists by the 1880s were using the rhetoric of \"white slavery\" to reveal men's sexual and social oppression of women. By demanding that men take responsibility for the right of women to walk the streets in safety, New Zealand feminists deployed the rhetoric of white slavery to argue for women's sexual and social freedom.[55] Middle class women successfully mobilised to stop prostitution, especially during the First World War.[56]\n\ndoc40108: Legal issues in airsoft. Police, New Zealand, Airguns Factsheet, retrieved 24 July 2007\u00c2\n\ndoc2295139: Auckland Harbour Bridge. On Sunday, 24 May 2009, thousands of people crossed the bridge as a part of a protest by GetAcross against the bridge not providing walking and cycling access, and against what the group perceives to be the authorities' negative and obstructionist attitude towards such access.[49] A crossing either as part of the protest or as part of the official 50-year anniversary celebrations had been forbidden by NZTA because of the costs and traffic difficulties claimed for a managed crossing. However, after several speeches, including by Auckland Regional Council Chairman Mike Lee, several people made their way around the police cordon onto the bridge. At that stage police closed the northbound lanes to traffic, bringing State Highway 1 to a stop. The remainder of the protesters moving onto the bridge, which was not resisted any more by the police. No accidents, violence or arrests were reported,[49] and protesters left the bridge approximately an hour later, many having crossed to the North Shore and back.\n\ndoc2245146: Constitution of New Zealand. New Zealand law has three principal sources: English common law; certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689); and statutes of the Parliament of New Zealand. In interpreting common law, there is a rebuttable presumption in support of uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions. Non-uniformity arises where the New Zealand courts consider local conditions to warrant it or where the law has been codified by New Zealand statute.[3] The maintenance of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London as the final court of appeal and judges' practice of tending to follow British decisions, even though, technically, they are not bound by them, both bolstered this presumption. The Supreme Court of New Zealand, which was established by legislation in October 2003 and which replaced the Privy Council for future appeals, has continued to develop the presumption.\n\ndoc2564629: New Zealand national cricket team. Perhaps New Zealand's most infamous one-day match was the \"Under arm\" match against Australia at the MCG in 1981. Requiring six runs to tie the match off the final ball, Australian captain Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to \"bowl\" the ball underarm along the wicket to prevent New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie from hitting a six. The Australian umpires ruled the move as legal even though to this day many believe it was one of the most unsporting decisions made in cricket.\n\ndoc2145439: Law of New Zealand. New Zealand contract law was initially derived from the English model. Since 1969, however, a series of Acts of Parliament altered this, and New Zealand contract law is now 'largely... distinct from other jurisdictions'.[3] The main distinction of New Zealand contract law is the wide discretionary power given to courts in granting relief. Although these changes were initially opposed due to fears that they would make the remedy of contractual disputes unpredictable and increase levels of litigation, it is generally agreed that this has not happened, and that the laws are working satisfactorily.[4]\n\ndoc2410389: New Zealand nuclear-free zone. After the Disarmament and Arms Control Act was passed by the Lange-led Labour government, the United States government suspended its ANZUS obligations to New Zealand. The legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity.[6][7] New Zealand's three decade anti-nuclear campaign is the only successful movement of its type in the world which resulted in the nation's nuclear-weapon-free zone status being enshrined in legislation.[8]\n\ndoc2397926: Education in New Zealand. Bullying is a widespread issue in New Zealand schools. In 2007, one in five New Zealand high school students reported being cyber-bullied.[44] In regard to physical bullying, an international study in 2009 found New Zealand had the second highest incidence of bullying out of the 40 countries surveyed.[45]\n\n"

The law was introduced to the New Zealand Parliament as a private members bill by Green Party Member of Parliament Sue Bradford in 2005, after being drawn from the ballot. It drew intense debate, both in Parliament and from the public. The bill was colloquially referred to by several of its opponents and newspapers as the \"anti-smacking bill\".[1] The bill was passed on its third reading on 16 May 2007 by 113 votes to eight.[2][3] The Governor-General of New Zealand granted the bill Royal Assent on 21 May 2007, and the law came into effect on 21 June 2007.\n\ndoc38371: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. On March 24, 2017, it was Reported that New Zealand First and Winston Peters will take to the election a policy of repeal the anti-smacking law passed by the last parliament. They will not enter any coalition or confidence and supply agreement with a party that wishes to ignore the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly stated view in a referendum on that issue after the New Zealand general election, 2017[35]\n\ndoc806030: Gun laws in New Zealand. The two major anti-gun groups in recent years have been the Coalition for Gun Control, and Gunsafe NZ. Neither is still active, but were led by activist Philip Alpers and Mike Meyrick, a former police officer and lawyer.[15]\n\ndoc806025: Gun laws in New Zealand. The New Zealand Police administer and enforce the Arms Act 1983.[7] They are issued Bushmaster XM-15 semi-automatic rifles, Glock 17 gen 4 pistols, and Tasers, which are normally carried in patrol cars and not on the officers.[8]\n\ndoc1513188: Gangs in New Zealand. A law banning gang patches from government and public buildings was introduced in 2012 by National MP Todd McClay.[73] Police welcomed the law,[74]\n\ndoc806016: Gun laws in New Zealand. An internal police report in 1982 criticised the proposals, saying there was no evidence that registration of guns helped to solve crimes, and that registration would use time and money better spent on other police work. This policy was adopted by the government in the 1983 Act.[5]\n\ndoc806031: Gun laws in New Zealand. The main parties, Labour and National, generally treat gun control as a bi-partisan issue. Both support the passage of the Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill[citation needed].\n\ndoc806004: Gun laws in New Zealand. C Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Restricted weapons\n\ndoc806028: Gun laws in New Zealand. The Sporting Shooters Association of New Zealand is a part-time lobby group that is usually only active at elections and when there are government calls for gun control laws. It is smaller than COLFO.\n\ndoc1862081: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Criminal Justice The Act requires that everyone who is charged with an offence:\n\ndoc1862078: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Everyone who is arrested or who is detained has the right to:\n\ndoc806020: Gun laws in New Zealand. The law also created the new category of \"military-style semi-automatic\", which like the Federal Assault Weapons Ban two years later in the United States, mainly covered the appearance rather than the functionality of the guns. These required a special endorsement, security and registration in the same manner as pistols, but could be used wherever A-category guns could.\n\ndoc805996: Gun laws in New Zealand. In March 2009 the New Zealand police bid to reclassify certain types of civilian semi-automatic firearms was overturned by the New Zealand High Court as a result of a legal challenge mounted by the New Zealand National Shooters Association (NSA) president Richard Lincoln.\n\ndoc805997: Gun laws in New Zealand. Gun laws in New Zealand are notably more liberal than other countries in the Pacific and focus mainly on vetting firearm owners, rather than registering firearms or banning certain types of firearms.[4] Firearms legislation is provided for in the Arms Act and its associated regulations, though stricter unofficial police and government policies also apply[citation needed].\n\ndoc1897168: Alcohol in New Zealand. Laws for M\ud6eeori\nThe first laws prohibiting M\ud6eeori people from consuming alcohol in New Zealand were established between 1847 and 1878. Laws were passed due to the common belief the M\ud6eeori were susceptible to alcohol abuse.[7]\n\ndoc2669994: Speed limits in New Zealand. Although there is no minimum posted speed limit, it is illegal to drive at an \"unreasonably slow speed\" which means slow drivers are required by law to pull over to the side of the road to allow queues of cars behind them to pass. The police can and do enforce this law in which the offending driver is given anything from an NZ$150 infringement notice for Inconsiderate Driving to possibly an indictment for careless driving which is usually dealt with by the Courts.\n\ndoc806022: Gun laws in New Zealand. The government decided to order another report, this time led by former judge Thomas Thorp. The report was released in 1997 and called for many new restrictions on legal gun ownership, including banning various features, and that all guns be registered (the last particularly unpopular with firearm owners).\n\ndoc2317548: Treason. New Zealand has treason laws that are stipulated under the Crimes Act 1961. Section 73 of the Crimes Act reads as follows:\n\ndoc1862079: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Everyone who is arrested for an offence has the right to be charged promptly or to be released. Everyone who is arrested or detained for any offence or suspected offence shall have the right to:\n\ndoc806017: Gun laws in New Zealand. The 1983 Arms Act abandoned registration for most long guns, as Parliament felt it was prohibitively expensive and not particularly useful. The philosophy of the new system was to control users, rather than firearms. Police were required to conduct a background check before a licence would be issued (though existing owners would be issued a licence automatically), but once a person had a licence there was no requirement to register long guns or obtain a permit-to-procure when they were sold or lent.\n\ndoc806013: Gun laws in New Zealand. Firearms first arrived in New Zealand with European traders and were traded in large numbers to the native M\u0101ori. This lead partly to the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. The first gun control laws were enacted in 1845, but early regulations were ineffective until the passage of the Arms Act in 1860, which required licences and registration of firearms and firearm dealers. Early laws were mainly targeted at M\u0101ori during the land wars in the Waikato and Taranaki, and were largely suspended at the end of the 1880s. By about 1910 the laws were ignored and unenforced, as crime and the threat of political unrest were minimal.\n\ndoc806023: Gun laws in New Zealand. The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1790286: Citizen's arrest. Specifically, the Crimes Act 1961 states that everyone (not just New Zealand citizens) is justified in arresting without warrant:[42]\n\ndoc806026: Gun laws in New Zealand. The New Zealand Police Association, the police union / service association, has repeatedly lobbied for greater access to firearms for police officers.[9][10][11] As well as stricter regulations on licensed firearm owners.[12][13][14]\n\ndoc1862098: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The resistance to an entrenched bill of rights in New Zealand is because the country is governed by parliamentary sovereignty. Giving the courts the power to strike down Parliament\u2019s legislation would be contrary to the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy.[28] There is also resistance because the protection of human rights is not the courts\u2019 responsibility and should involve all branches of government.[29]\n\ndoc806018: Gun laws in New Zealand. Special restrictions applied to restricted weapons and pistols, which needed to be registered. Self-defence was no longer a valid reason to have a pistol (although the Crimes Act 1961 states a person can use \"reasonable force\" to defend oneself and/or one's property, and nowhere in this act states a person cannot use a firearm for such purposes, while the arms act does not mention \"directly in words\" one cannot use a firearm for self-defence), but the new sport of target pistol shooting has become more popular, and pistol club shooters can own pistols with a special \"B\" endorsement.\n\ndoc806033: Gun laws in New Zealand. The Green Party supports an increase in legislative restrictions on public access to firearms.[16] The Greens policies include the full ban of private ownership of all semi automatic firearms and the reintroduction of a national firearms registry.[17]\n\ndoc673527: Public intoxication. In New Zealand, drinking in public is not a crime and instead, local governments must specify that alcohol is banned in an area before it is considered a crime to drink in that location. Being drunk in public is not specifically an offense unless the person who is intoxicated is a public nuisance, in which case they may be dealt with for 'disturbing the peace'. This will usually result in being taken home, or otherwise taken to a police cell until sober.\n\ndoc2173071: New Zealand\u2013United Kingdom relations. A number of these acts were repealed through the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989.[10]\n\ndoc806008: Gun laws in New Zealand. E Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Military-style semi-automatics\n\ndoc806011: Gun laws in New Zealand. This class allows a person working for a dealer to demonstrate a pistol, military-style semi-automatic or a collectable weapon without having to have that class of licence. They can demonstrate one but not possess one for personal use. This is not a well known endorsement\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A large number of cases have been heard under the Act since it was passed in 1990, mostly pertaining to rights around arrest and detention.\n\ndoc1152406: Road rage. In New Zealand, Road Rage in itself is not an offence,[13] but Drivers are usually charged with other offences committed during an act of road rage (usually assault or unlawful possession of an offensive weapon). Drivers have a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid endangerment of human life when operating a vehicle (s 156 Crimes Act 1961); failure to discharge this duty, such as an act of aggressive driving, can give rise to liability in criminal nuisance (s 146 Crimes Act 1961). Ramming a vehicle constitutes intentional or reckless damage to property, a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment (s 269 Crimes Act 1961). New Zealand courts currently have no powers to disqualify drivers who physically assault another road user.[citation needed]\n\ndoc76451: Politics of New Zealand. New Zealand law has three principal sources: English common law, certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689), and statutes of the New Zealand Parliament.[33] In interpreting common law, the courts have endeavoured to preserve uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions.[34]\n\ndoc1513186: Gangs in New Zealand. Some politicians have called for gang patches to be made illegal.[68][69][70]\n\ndoc38340: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. A citizens-initiated referendum on the issues surrounding the law was held between 30 July and 21 August 2009, asking \"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\" Despite widespread criticism of the question's wording, the referendum was returned with an 87.4 percent \"No\" vote on a turnout of 56.1 percent.\n\ndoc806027: Gun laws in New Zealand. The Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO) was set up in 1996.\n\ndoc806003: Gun laws in New Zealand. B Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Target (competition) pistols\n\ndoc806005: Gun laws in New Zealand. Pistols can also be held on the C endorsement instead of the B. Common special reasons include:\n\ndoc516910: Cannabis in New Zealand. The use of cannabis in New Zealand is governed by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, which makes unauthorised possession of any amount of cannabis illegal. There are political efforts to remove penalties on its use for those over 18 years of age. In October 2017, following the ascension of a Labour/Green/New Zealand First coalition to government, the Greens announced a nationwide referendum of the legality of cannabis for both medical and personal use.\n\ndoc806029: Gun laws in New Zealand. The National Shooters Association is a nationwide civilian gun owners association that took the forefront in a 2009 legal challenge against unauthorised police interference with gun regulations. Its executive is largely made up of former members of the Practical Shooting Institute, a predecessor group which had similar success bringing court action against Police interference in 1990.\n\ndoc806021: Gun laws in New Zealand. After two shootings by police in 1995, the government ordered an inquiry into police procedures for storing and using firearms. Before the review started, massacres overseas at Dunblane and Port Arthur led the government to expand the scope to gun control generally. The police reported that the system was sound and that no major changes were needed.\n\ndoc1049514: History of rugby union in New Zealand. Two games had to be cancelled.[8] The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at Timaru was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.[8]\n\ndoc805998: Gun laws in New Zealand. Firearms in New Zealand fall into one of four categories:\n\ndoc2661844: Wasting police time. In New Zealand, one can be charged under Section 24 of the Summary Offences Act 1981[4] for committing either of the following acts:\n\ndoc40110: Legal issues in airsoft. Legislation, New Zealand, Arms Act 1983, retrieved 15 July 2014\u00c2\n\ndoc518316: Freedom of speech by country. The right to freedom of speech is not explicitly protected by common law in New Zealand, but is encompassed in a wide range of doctrines aimed at protecting free speech.[69] An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press.[70] In particular, freedom of expression is preserved in section 14 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (BORA) which states that:\n\ndoc2300292: Sedition. Following a recommendation from the New Zealand Law Commission,[33] the New Zealand government announced on 7 May 2007 that the sedition law would be repealed.[34] The Crimes (Repeal of Seditious Offences) Amendment Act 2007 was passed on 24 October 2007, and entered into force on 1 January 2008.[35]\n\ndoc806014: Gun laws in New Zealand. Strikes in 1912 and 1913, a Communist revolution in Russia, and large numbers of ex-military guns coming into the country after World War I were used as justification for a new law in 1920. The new law required the registration of all firearms and issuance of a \"permit to procure\" before a firearm was transferred. Semi-automatic pistols were banned and a special permit was needed for other pistols (e.g. revolvers), with the intent of discouraging the carrying of concealed weapons. Few changes were seen for the next forty years as crime remained low and the country avoided political violence.\n\ndoc806024: Gun laws in New Zealand. In August 2009, the Police decided that any firearm, including single shot bolt action rifles, with a free-standing pistol grip that could allow the firearm to be shot inaccurately from the hip would be defined as an MSSA.[6] However, the High Court rejected this attempt in Lincoln v Police [2010] BCL 194; 33 TCL 11/2.\n\ndoc2145434: Law of New Zealand. Another problem with the idea that the Treaty established the rule of British law is that in 1840 M\ud6eeori still controlled New Zealand. Although the British had sent a governor, they had not backed him up with troops and for the first few years of supposed British sovereignty, Europeans were significantly outnumbered and outgunned by M\ud6eeori. M\ud6eeori generally obeyed British law in European settlements and when they or their chiefs chose to, but there was nothing to make them obey the law in areas they controlled, which until about the 1860s was most of the country. British law, and later New Zealand law as passed by the New Zealand parliament was slowly established over the country, but it remained ineffective in M\ud6eeori-controlled areas until the late nineteenth century at least. In practical terms, British-based law was established in New Zealand not through the Treaty of Waitangi but through conquest and settlement.\n\ndoc806007: Gun laws in New Zealand. For those that make an income from firearms. To sell restricted weapons the dealer also needs to have the appropriate endorsements.\n\ndoc1897169: Alcohol in New Zealand. For over a century, from the 1847 laws to 1948, M\u0101ori were restricted to buying alcohol from off-licensed vendors. In 1948 Parliament repealed most discriminatory measures, in part due to pressure from M\u0101ori servicemen returning from war.[7]\n\ndoc805999: Gun laws in New Zealand. Registration is not required under the law but the police carry out a regime similar to registration for all but \"A Category\" firearms. Firearms in any other category require a \"permit to procure\" before they are transferred.\n\ndoc38364: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The first petition was supported by Family First New Zealand, the ACT Party[28] and The Kiwi Party.[26]\n\ndoc466193: School corporal punishment. Corporal punishment in New Zealand schools was abolished in 1987, but wasn't abolished legislatively until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or ECE provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control.[108] Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in termination and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.[109]\n\ndoc253: Tobacco advertising. Tobacco advertising in New Zealand was outlawed with the passage of the Smokefree Amendment Act 1990.\n\ndoc667029: Legal tender. New Zealand has a complex history of legal tender. English law applied, as applicable to local circumstances, from either 6 January 1840, when the Governor of New South Wales by proclamation annexed New Zealand, or from 14 January 1840 when Captain Hobson Royal Navy was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor. The English Laws Act 1858 subsequently confirmed that English legislation passed prior to 14 January 1840 was and had been the law of New Zealand, as applicable to local circumstances. The (UK) Coinage Act 1816 therefore applied and British coins were confirmed as legal tender in New Zealand. Unusually, until 1989, the Reserve Bank did not have the right to issue coins as legal tender. Coins had to be issued by the Minister of Finance.\n\ndoc30318: Flag of New Zealand. In March 1994 the Prime Minister of New Zealand Jim Bolger made statements supporting a move towards a New Zealand republic.[17] In response Christian Democrat MP Graeme Lee introduced a Flags, Anthems, Emblems, and Names Protection Amendment Bill.[18] If passed, the Bill would have entrenched the Act that governs the flag and added New Zealand's anthems, requiring a majority of 65 percent of votes in Parliament before any future legislation could change the flag. The Bill passed its first reading but was defeated at its second reading, 26 votes to 37.\n\ndoc1897167: Alcohol in New Zealand. The liquor laws of New Zealand begin with the Colonisation of New Zealand and the implementation of English Common Law to New Zealand between 1840 and 1842, when New Zealand was jurisdictionally part of the Colony of New South Wales.[7]\n\ndoc1664411: New Zealanders. Agitation regarding Treaty of Waitangi violations intensified in the 1970s. The Waitangi Tribunal was set up in 1975 to consider alleged breaches, and in 1984 was empowered to look back to 1840.[47]\n\ndoc1324332: Capital punishment in New Zealand. Capital punishment in New Zealand first appeared in a codified form when it became a British territory in 1840, and was first employed in 1842.[1] It was last used in 1957, abolished for murder in 1961, and abolished altogether, including for treason, in 1989. During the period that it was in effect, 85 people were executed.\n\ndoc38354: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The law change has been described by supporters as aimed at making 'Aotearoa New Zealand [\u2026] a place where children are secure, confident, understand limits and boundaries and behave well \u2013 without physical punishment' and to 'protect children from assault'.[14]\n\ndoc38351: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. Bradford considers that smacking was illegal even before the Act was passed.[10] When an illegal activity is reported to the Police or to Child Youth and Family (CYF), they are required to investigate the reported abuse. Under subsection 4, The Police have the option of not prosecuting the parents 'where the offence is considered to be so inconsequential that there is no public interest in proceeding with a prosecution.'\n\ndoc1862075: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The Act also (Section 18(4)) ensures that non-New Zealand citizens lawfully in New Zealand shall not be required to leave except under a decision taken on grounds prescribed by law.\n\ndoc805994: Gun laws in New Zealand. Gun licenses are issued at the discretion of the police in New Zealand provided the police consider the person to be of good standing and without criminal, psychiatric or drug issues as well as meeting other conditions such as having suitable storage facilities. To be issued, they must be issued for a valid reason, which may not include self defense. Several different categories of licenses are permitted, with the lowest one permitting access to restricted semi-automatic rifles and shotguns, with limited capacity, while the higher levels which permit fully automatic weaponry and pistols are rarely issued to civilians.\n\ndoc1772171: Military history of New Zealand during World War II. The military history of New Zealand during World War II began when New Zealand entered the Second World War by declaring war on Nazi Germany with Great Britain. The state of war with Germany was officially held to have existed since 9:30 pm on 3 September 1939 (local time), simultaneous with that of Britain, but in fact the declaration of war was not made until confirmation had been received from Britain that their ultimatum to Germany had expired. The group (led by Peter Fraser as Prime Minister Mickey Savage was terminally ill) listened to the shortwave radio in Carl Berendsen's room in Parliament Buildings but were not certain what Neville Chamberlain had said because of static on the short-wave radio, and a coded telegraph message from London did not arrive until just before midnight as the messenger boy with the telegram in London took shelter because of a (false) air-raid warning. The Cabinet acted after hearing the Admiralty's notification to the fleet that war had broken out. The next day Cabinet approved nearly 30 war regulations as laid down in the War Book, and after completing the formalities with the Executive Council the Governor-General, Lord Galway, issued the Proclamation of War, backdated to 9.30 pm on 3 September.[1][2]\n\ndoc38355: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The first conviction under the new law occurred on 22 November 2007.[15] In the first five years of the law (June 2007 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c June 2012) there were eight prosecutions for smacking.[16][17]\n\ndoc1862095: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Several other remedies were suggested to be available in R v Taylor (1996) 14 CRNZ 426. These included a reduction in the penalty, police disciplinary proceedings, criminal prosecution, a declaration, or future-looking relief.[21] Other remedies have included special jury directions, and orders that witness testimony be disregarded.[22] It can often depend on the nature of the right breached as to what remedy will be appropriate to vindicate that breach.[23]\n\ndoc1324350: Capital punishment in New Zealand. Occasional calls to reinstate capital punishment still occur, but no major political party has made capital punishment an element of any of their election manifestos since the 1989 Abolition act.\n\ndoc2345864: Health care in New Zealand. Abortion is legal in New Zealand, if certain criteria are met. In general, either the health of the pregnant woman or the foetus must be in jeopardy. Additionally, two doctors must give their consent to the procedure. There were 18,380 abortions carried out in 2007, following a general increase in both the absolute number and per capita rate since 1991.\n\ndoc1049511: History of rugby union in New Zealand. The 1981 Springbok Tour, or The Tour, went down as one of the most controversial rugby tours ever. From July to September, the Springboks toured New Zealand. Rugby fans filled the stadiums, yet equal numbers of fans protested the games outside the stadiums. Police were divided into Red and Blue riot squads for the tour, and in preparation for possible trouble, all spectators were told to assemble in sports grounds at least an hour before kickoff. At a game at Rugby Park in Hamilton, around 350 protesters pulled down a fence and invaded the pitch. Police, already very worried, pulled the match when they found out a light plane piloted by a protester was headed to fly around the stadium. A protest turned violent in Wellington the following week, escalating the situation. During the final test match at Eden Park, a low flying plane dropped flour bombs over the pitch. These images were beamed around the world, and looked as though a civil crisis had engulfed New Zealand. A subsequent 1985 All Black tour was prevented by the High Court, but an unofficial tour took place the following year.\n\ndoc2295140: Auckland Harbour Bridge. The protest created a wide spectrum of responses in the media and in public perception, from being labelled a dangerous stunt representative of an increasingly lawless, anarchic society[50] to being considered a successful signal to authorities to give more weight to the demands and the public backing of the walk and cycleway proponents. Authorities noted that they were investigating whether any of the protesters would face fines or charges.[51] NZTA representatives noted that they were disappointed at what they considered the broken word of the organisers of the protest, and remarked that it would take 30 more years before walking and cycling could likely be provided (see also \"Second Harbour Crossing\" below).[49] NZTA were criticised as having brought the situation at least partly onto themselves by choosing the easy route of forbidding the protest crossing.[50] Several political protest marches (especially hikois) had been allowed to cross the bridge.\n\ndoc1862097: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. It is an on-going conversation amongst legal academics in New Zealand as to whether there should be an entrenched constitutional bill of rights that gives the court the power to strike down inconsistent legislation.[25] This would provide a remedy to breaches of the Bill of Rights Act 1990 as the courts could uphold the right, rather than finding it to be subservient under s4. The UN Human Rights Committee criticised New Zealand for the lack of court power to strike down legislation inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act 1990. They equated this lack of power with a lack of human rights protection[26] Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler published a book in 2016 entitled A Constitution for Aotearoa New Zealand[27] that laid out a proposed entrenched bill of rights, including a judicial power of strike down. This was intended to start a conversation in New Zealand as to whether entrenching their bill of rights in a constitution was the way forward.\n\ndoc159166: Drunk driving law by country. New Zealand operates a program called Compulsory Breath Testing, which allows police to stop motorists at any time. CBT is usually carried out at roadside checkpoints but mobile patrol cars can also randomly stop motorists to administer a test. The police also carry out roadside drug tests upon motorists they suspect have used drugs.[90]\n\ndoc806010: Gun laws in New Zealand. F Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Dealers staff licence\n\ndoc323122: Overview of gun laws by nation. New Zealand's gun laws comprise the Arms Act of 1983,[147]\nArms Amendment Act 1992,[148]\nand Arms Regulations 1992,[149]\nand focus mainly on vetting firearm owners. A firearms licence may be issued by police to applicants who attend a safety lecture, pass a written test on safety and the Arms Code, and have secure storage for firearms and ammunition; the police will also interview the applicant and two references to be certain the applicant is \"fit and proper\" to own a firearm. Having criminal associations, a history of domestic violence, mental instability, or alcohol or drug abuse almost always result in the application being denied. Misbehavior involving firearms commonly leads to a firearms licence being revoked by police. Even when licensed, a person may only be in possession of a firearm for a particular lawful, proper and sufficient purpose,[150]\nwhich the NZ Police claim specifically excludes self-defence, however this is not written in the Arms Act or supporting regulations.[151]\n\ndoc1513187: Gangs in New Zealand. In 2009 the Wanganui District Council voted to ban gang patches, but it was overturned following a judicial review instigated by the Hells Angels.[71] The council tried again in 2011, this time restricting the ban to just the central business district, malls and parks.[72]\n\ndoc1862087: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A common remedy to the Bill of Rights Act 1990 is that the evidence obtained through breaching a right is inadmissible in court. This developed in the courts as a presumption of exclusion but was then lessened to a balancing exercise where various factors are weighed up to determine the admissibility of evidence tainted by a breach of the Bill of Rights Act 1990.[7] This remedy is now reflected in section 30 of the Evidence Act 2006.[8]\n\ndoc1862082: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Fair Trial Everyone who is charged with an offence has the minimum right:\n\ndoc40106: Legal issues in airsoft. Air-powered firearms are legal to possess and use in New Zealand, provided that the person is either over 18 years of age or 16 with a firearms license. A person under 18 may not possess an air gun, but may use one under the direct supervision of someone over 18 or a firearms license holder (Direct supervision requires that the license holder be able to take control of the firearm at all times, so they must remain within arms reach).\n\ndoc805993: Gun laws in New Zealand. About 230,000 licensed firearms owners own and use New Zealand's estimated 1.1 million firearms.[1] As in Australia, but unlike the US and Canada, gun laws usually gain the support of both major parties before they are passed. Guns are not currently a major political issue, but have been immediately after the Aramoana massacre in 1990, and the Scottish Dunblane and Australian Port Arthur massacres in 1996.\n\ndoc2317551: Treason. Very few people have been prosecuted for the act of treason in New Zealand and none have been prosecuted in recent years.[21]\n\ndoc2410390: New Zealand nuclear-free zone. Initial seeds were sown for New Zealand's 1987 nuclear free zone legislation in the late 1950s with the formation of the local Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) organisation between 1957 and 1959.[9][10] In 1959, responding to rising public concern following the British hydrogen bomb tests in Australia and the Pacific, New Zealand voted in the UN to condemn nuclear testing while the UK, US and France voted against, and Australia abstained.[11] In 1961, CND urged the New Zealand government to declare that it would not acquire or use nuclear weapons and to withdraw from nuclear alliances such as ANZUS. In 1963, the Auckland CND campaign submitted its 'No Bombs South of the Line' petition to the New Zealand parliament with 80,238 signatures calling on the government to sponsor an international conference to discuss establishing a nuclear-free-zone in the southern hemisphere. It was the biggest petition in the nation since the one in 1893 which demanded that women must have the right to vote.[12]\n\ndoc2020110: Graffiti. In February 2008 Helen Clark, the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in Auckland during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of manslaughter.\n\ndoc1049521: History of rugby union in New Zealand. New Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with South Africa, especially through rugby union. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against M\u0101ori players, since the apartheid political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that M\u0101ori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being M\u0101ori, this was agreed to, and M\u0101ori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some M\u0101ori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at M\u0101ori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group Halt All Racist Tours was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which M\u0101ori were central, and M\u0101ori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by P\u0101keh\u0101 (white New Zealanders).\n\ndoc952715: Islam in New Zealand. In 2006, two newspapers in New Zealand decided to republish controversial Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. The Muslim community registered their displeasure through press statements and a small peaceful march in Auckland. The editors said they did not mean offence but would not back down. Prime Minister Helen Clark and opposition leader Don Brash both made statements that the cartoons were not appreciated if they deeply offended members of the New Zealand community, but that such decisions were for editors to make, not politicians. Muslim leaders and the editors got together with the Race Relations office, and Jewish and Christian representatives in Wellington. As a result of this meeting the editors said they would not apologise but in good faith would refrain from publishing the offending images again. The New Zealand Muslim leadership, through the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIAN]Z, then proceeded in good faith to consider the matter closed, and drafted letters to 52 Muslim countries reversing their earlier stance and asking that New Zealand products not be boycotted.[18][19]\n\ndoc2317549: Treason. Every one owing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand commits treason who, within or outside New Zealand,\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\n\ndoc2222778: New Zealand nationality law. This law has been controversial. A 2003 petition asking the Parliament of New Zealand to repeal the Act attracted 100,000 signatures, and the Samoan rights group Mau Sitiseni filed a petition on the issue with the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2007.[6]\n\ndoc1049519: History of rugby union in New Zealand. The role of the NZ police also became more controversial as a result of the tour.\n\ndoc1310356: New Zealand national rugby union team. The 1981 South African tour to New Zealand sparked protests against South Africa's apartheid policy, the likes of which had not been seen in New Zealand since the 1951 waterfront dispute.[67][68] The NZRU had invited the Springboks to tour as the Muldoon government refused to involve politics in sport.[69] Although New Zealand won the test series, two of the tour's provincial games were cancelled and the whole tour was marred by violence and protest.[70] The third and final test match of the tour is sometimes known as the Flour Bomb test, as an anti-apartheid activist in a Cessna light aircraft dropped leaflets, flares, a parachute-supported banner reading \"Biko\" and flour bombs into Auckland's Eden Park throughout the match, felling a New Zealand player. During the tour the country experienced unrest, and the tour had a significant impact on New Zealand society.[67][70][71]\n\ndoc806009: Gun laws in New Zealand. New class of restricted weapon that was created after the Aramoana shooting spree. At the time anyone with an MSSA that wanted to keep it in that configuration was given a E endorsement (after going through the vetting and extra security requirements). But presently few are issued. Common reasons for wanting an E endorsement are professional pest destruction, collecting, 3-gun and service rifle shooting. Those people that did not want the extra hassle and expense of the endorsement converted their rifles into 'A' configuration by removing the components that made it an 'E'.\n\ndoc430006: History of New Zealand. Feminists by the 1880s were using the rhetoric of \"white slavery\" to reveal men's sexual and social oppression of women. By demanding that men take responsibility for the right of women to walk the streets in safety, New Zealand feminists deployed the rhetoric of white slavery to argue for women's sexual and social freedom.[55] Middle class women successfully mobilised to stop prostitution, especially during the First World War.[56]\n\ndoc40108: Legal issues in airsoft. Police, New Zealand, Airguns Factsheet, retrieved 24 July 2007\u00c2\n\ndoc2295139: Auckland Harbour Bridge. On Sunday, 24 May 2009, thousands of people crossed the bridge as a part of a protest by GetAcross against the bridge not providing walking and cycling access, and against what the group perceives to be the authorities' negative and obstructionist attitude towards such access.[49] A crossing either as part of the protest or as part of the official 50-year anniversary celebrations had been forbidden by NZTA because of the costs and traffic difficulties claimed for a managed crossing. However, after several speeches, including by Auckland Regional Council Chairman Mike Lee, several people made their way around the police cordon onto the bridge. At that stage police closed the northbound lanes to traffic, bringing State Highway 1 to a stop. The remainder of the protesters moving onto the bridge, which was not resisted any more by the police. No accidents, violence or arrests were reported,[49] and protesters left the bridge approximately an hour later, many having crossed to the North Shore and back.\n\ndoc2245146: Constitution of New Zealand. New Zealand law has three principal sources: English common law; certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689); and statutes of the Parliament of New Zealand. In interpreting common law, there is a rebuttable presumption in support of uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions. Non-uniformity arises where the New Zealand courts consider local conditions to warrant it or where the law has been codified by New Zealand statute.[3] The maintenance of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London as the final court of appeal and judges' practice of tending to follow British decisions, even though, technically, they are not bound by them, both bolstered this presumption. The Supreme Court of New Zealand, which was established by legislation in October 2003 and which replaced the Privy Council for future appeals, has continued to develop the presumption.\n\ndoc2564629: New Zealand national cricket team. Perhaps New Zealand's most infamous one-day match was the \"Under arm\" match against Australia at the MCG in 1981. Requiring six runs to tie the match off the final ball, Australian captain Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to \"bowl\" the ball underarm along the wicket to prevent New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie from hitting a six. The Australian umpires ruled the move as legal even though to this day many believe it was one of the most unsporting decisions made in cricket.\n\ndoc2145439: Law of New Zealand. New Zealand contract law was initially derived from the English model. Since 1969, however, a series of Acts of Parliament altered this, and New Zealand contract law is now 'largely... distinct from other jurisdictions'.[3] The main distinction of New Zealand contract law is the wide discretionary power given to courts in granting relief. Although these changes were initially opposed due to fears that they would make the remedy of contractual disputes unpredictable and increase levels of litigation, it is generally agreed that this has not happened, and that the laws are working satisfactorily.[4]\n\ndoc2410389: New Zealand nuclear-free zone. After the Disarmament and Arms Control Act was passed by the Lange-led Labour government, the United States government suspended its ANZUS obligations to New Zealand. The legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity.[6][7] New Zealand's three decade anti-nuclear campaign is the only successful movement of its type in the world which resulted in the nation's nuclear-weapon-free zone status being enshrined in legislation.[8]\n\ndoc2397926: Education in New Zealand. Bullying is a widespread issue in New Zealand schools. In 2007, one in five New Zealand high school students reported being cyber-bullied.[44] In regard to physical bullying, an international study in 2009 found New Zealand had the second highest incidence of bullying out of the 40 countries surveyed.[45]\n\n"

The law was introduced to the New Zealand Parliament as a private members bill by Green Party Member of Parliament Sue Bradford in 2005, after being drawn from the ballot. It drew intense debate, both in Parliament and from the public. The bill was colloquially referred to by several of its opponents and newspapers as the \"anti-smacking bill\".[1] The bill was passed on its third reading on 16 May 2007 by 113 votes to eight.[2][3] The Governor-General of New Zealand granted the bill Royal Assent on 21 May 2007, and the law came into effect on 21 June 2007.\n\ndoc38371: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. On March 24, 2017, it was Reported that New Zealand First and Winston Peters will take to the election a policy of repeal the anti-smacking law passed by the last parliament. They will not enter any coalition or confidence and supply agreement with a party that wishes to ignore the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly stated view in a referendum on that issue after the New Zealand general election, 2017[35]\n\ndoc806030: Gun laws in New Zealand. The two major anti-gun groups in recent years have been the Coalition for Gun Control, and Gunsafe NZ. Neither is still active, but were led by activist Philip Alpers and Mike Meyrick, a former police officer and lawyer.[15]\n\ndoc806025: Gun laws in New Zealand. The New Zealand Police administer and enforce the Arms Act 1983.[7] They are issued Bushmaster XM-15 semi-automatic rifles, Glock 17 gen 4 pistols, and Tasers, which are normally carried in patrol cars and not on the officers.[8]\n\ndoc1513188: Gangs in New Zealand. A law banning gang patches from government and public buildings was introduced in 2012 by National MP Todd McClay.[73] Police welcomed the law,[74]\n\ndoc806016: Gun laws in New Zealand. An internal police report in 1982 criticised the proposals, saying there was no evidence that registration of guns helped to solve crimes, and that registration would use time and money better spent on other police work. This policy was adopted by the government in the 1983 Act.[5]\n\ndoc806031: Gun laws in New Zealand. The main parties, Labour and National, generally treat gun control as a bi-partisan issue. Both support the passage of the Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill[citation needed].\n\ndoc806004: Gun laws in New Zealand. C Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Restricted weapons\n\ndoc806028: Gun laws in New Zealand. The Sporting Shooters Association of New Zealand is a part-time lobby group that is usually only active at elections and when there are government calls for gun control laws. It is smaller than COLFO.\n\ndoc1862081: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Criminal Justice The Act requires that everyone who is charged with an offence:\n\ndoc1862078: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Everyone who is arrested or who is detained has the right to:\n\ndoc806020: Gun laws in New Zealand. The law also created the new category of \"military-style semi-automatic\", which like the Federal Assault Weapons Ban two years later in the United States, mainly covered the appearance rather than the functionality of the guns. These required a special endorsement, security and registration in the same manner as pistols, but could be used wherever A-category guns could.\n\ndoc805996: Gun laws in New Zealand. In March 2009 the New Zealand police bid to reclassify certain types of civilian semi-automatic firearms was overturned by the New Zealand High Court as a result of a legal challenge mounted by the New Zealand National Shooters Association (NSA) president Richard Lincoln.\n\ndoc805997: Gun laws in New Zealand. Gun laws in New Zealand are notably more liberal than other countries in the Pacific and focus mainly on vetting firearm owners, rather than registering firearms or banning certain types of firearms.[4] Firearms legislation is provided for in the Arms Act and its associated regulations, though stricter unofficial police and government policies also apply[citation needed].\n\ndoc1897168: Alcohol in New Zealand. Laws for M\ud6eeori\nThe first laws prohibiting M\ud6eeori people from consuming alcohol in New Zealand were established between 1847 and 1878. Laws were passed due to the common belief the M\ud6eeori were susceptible to alcohol abuse.[7]\n\ndoc2669994: Speed limits in New Zealand. Although there is no minimum posted speed limit, it is illegal to drive at an \"unreasonably slow speed\" which means slow drivers are required by law to pull over to the side of the road to allow queues of cars behind them to pass. The police can and do enforce this law in which the offending driver is given anything from an NZ$150 infringement notice for Inconsiderate Driving to possibly an indictment for careless driving which is usually dealt with by the Courts.\n\ndoc806022: Gun laws in New Zealand. The government decided to order another report, this time led by former judge Thomas Thorp. The report was released in 1997 and called for many new restrictions on legal gun ownership, including banning various features, and that all guns be registered (the last particularly unpopular with firearm owners).\n\ndoc2317548: Treason. New Zealand has treason laws that are stipulated under the Crimes Act 1961. Section 73 of the Crimes Act reads as follows:\n\ndoc1862079: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Everyone who is arrested for an offence has the right to be charged promptly or to be released. Everyone who is arrested or detained for any offence or suspected offence shall have the right to:\n\ndoc806017: Gun laws in New Zealand. The 1983 Arms Act abandoned registration for most long guns, as Parliament felt it was prohibitively expensive and not particularly useful. The philosophy of the new system was to control users, rather than firearms. Police were required to conduct a background check before a licence would be issued (though existing owners would be issued a licence automatically), but once a person had a licence there was no requirement to register long guns or obtain a permit-to-procure when they were sold or lent.\n\ndoc806013: Gun laws in New Zealand. Firearms first arrived in New Zealand with European traders and were traded in large numbers to the native M\u0101ori. This lead partly to the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. The first gun control laws were enacted in 1845, but early regulations were ineffective until the passage of the Arms Act in 1860, which required licences and registration of firearms and firearm dealers. Early laws were mainly targeted at M\u0101ori during the land wars in the Waikato and Taranaki, and were largely suspended at the end of the 1880s. By about 1910 the laws were ignored and unenforced, as crime and the threat of political unrest were minimal.\n\ndoc806023: Gun laws in New Zealand. The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1790286: Citizen's arrest. Specifically, the Crimes Act 1961 states that everyone (not just New Zealand citizens) is justified in arresting without warrant:[42]\n\ndoc806026: Gun laws in New Zealand. The New Zealand Police Association, the police union / service association, has repeatedly lobbied for greater access to firearms for police officers.[9][10][11] As well as stricter regulations on licensed firearm owners.[12][13][14]\n\ndoc1862098: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The resistance to an entrenched bill of rights in New Zealand is because the country is governed by parliamentary sovereignty. Giving the courts the power to strike down Parliament\u2019s legislation would be contrary to the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy.[28] There is also resistance because the protection of human rights is not the courts\u2019 responsibility and should involve all branches of government.[29]\n\ndoc806018: Gun laws in New Zealand. Special restrictions applied to restricted weapons and pistols, which needed to be registered. Self-defence was no longer a valid reason to have a pistol (although the Crimes Act 1961 states a person can use \"reasonable force\" to defend oneself and/or one's property, and nowhere in this act states a person cannot use a firearm for such purposes, while the arms act does not mention \"directly in words\" one cannot use a firearm for self-defence), but the new sport of target pistol shooting has become more popular, and pistol club shooters can own pistols with a special \"B\" endorsement.\n\ndoc806033: Gun laws in New Zealand. The Green Party supports an increase in legislative restrictions on public access to firearms.[16] The Greens policies include the full ban of private ownership of all semi automatic firearms and the reintroduction of a national firearms registry.[17]\n\ndoc673527: Public intoxication. In New Zealand, drinking in public is not a crime and instead, local governments must specify that alcohol is banned in an area before it is considered a crime to drink in that location. Being drunk in public is not specifically an offense unless the person who is intoxicated is a public nuisance, in which case they may be dealt with for 'disturbing the peace'. This will usually result in being taken home, or otherwise taken to a police cell until sober.\n\ndoc2173071: New Zealand\u2013United Kingdom relations. A number of these acts were repealed through the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989.[10]\n\ndoc806008: Gun laws in New Zealand. E Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Military-style semi-automatics\n\ndoc806011: Gun laws in New Zealand. This class allows a person working for a dealer to demonstrate a pistol, military-style semi-automatic or a collectable weapon without having to have that class of licence. They can demonstrate one but not possess one for personal use. This is not a well known endorsement\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A large number of cases have been heard under the Act since it was passed in 1990, mostly pertaining to rights around arrest and detention.\n\ndoc1152406: Road rage. In New Zealand, Road Rage in itself is not an offence,[13] but Drivers are usually charged with other offences committed during an act of road rage (usually assault or unlawful possession of an offensive weapon). Drivers have a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid endangerment of human life when operating a vehicle (s 156 Crimes Act 1961); failure to discharge this duty, such as an act of aggressive driving, can give rise to liability in criminal nuisance (s 146 Crimes Act 1961). Ramming a vehicle constitutes intentional or reckless damage to property, a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment (s 269 Crimes Act 1961). New Zealand courts currently have no powers to disqualify drivers who physically assault another road user.[citation needed]\n\ndoc76451: Politics of New Zealand. New Zealand law has three principal sources: English common law, certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689), and statutes of the New Zealand Parliament.[33] In interpreting common law, the courts have endeavoured to preserve uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions.[34]\n\ndoc1513186: Gangs in New Zealand. Some politicians have called for gang patches to be made illegal.[68][69][70]\n\ndoc38340: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. A citizens-initiated referendum on the issues surrounding the law was held between 30 July and 21 August 2009, asking \"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\" Despite widespread criticism of the question's wording, the referendum was returned with an 87.4 percent \"No\" vote on a turnout of 56.1 percent.\n\ndoc806027: Gun laws in New Zealand. The Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO) was set up in 1996.\n\ndoc806003: Gun laws in New Zealand. B Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Target (competition) pistols\n\ndoc806005: Gun laws in New Zealand. Pistols can also be held on the C endorsement instead of the B. Common special reasons include:\n\ndoc516910: Cannabis in New Zealand. The use of cannabis in New Zealand is governed by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, which makes unauthorised possession of any amount of cannabis illegal. There are political efforts to remove penalties on its use for those over 18 years of age. In October 2017, following the ascension of a Labour/Green/New Zealand First coalition to government, the Greens announced a nationwide referendum of the legality of cannabis for both medical and personal use.\n\ndoc806029: Gun laws in New Zealand. The National Shooters Association is a nationwide civilian gun owners association that took the forefront in a 2009 legal challenge against unauthorised police interference with gun regulations. Its executive is largely made up of former members of the Practical Shooting Institute, a predecessor group which had similar success bringing court action against Police interference in 1990.\n\ndoc806021: Gun laws in New Zealand. After two shootings by police in 1995, the government ordered an inquiry into police procedures for storing and using firearms. Before the review started, massacres overseas at Dunblane and Port Arthur led the government to expand the scope to gun control generally. The police reported that the system was sound and that no major changes were needed.\n\ndoc1049514: History of rugby union in New Zealand. Two games had to be cancelled.[8] The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at Timaru was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.[8]\n\ndoc805998: Gun laws in New Zealand. Firearms in New Zealand fall into one of four categories:\n\ndoc2661844: Wasting police time. In New Zealand, one can be charged under Section 24 of the Summary Offences Act 1981[4] for committing either of the following acts:\n\ndoc40110: Legal issues in airsoft. Legislation, New Zealand, Arms Act 1983, retrieved 15 July 2014\u00c2\n\ndoc518316: Freedom of speech by country. The right to freedom of speech is not explicitly protected by common law in New Zealand, but is encompassed in a wide range of doctrines aimed at protecting free speech.[69] An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press.[70] In particular, freedom of expression is preserved in section 14 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (BORA) which states that:\n\ndoc2300292: Sedition. Following a recommendation from the New Zealand Law Commission,[33] the New Zealand government announced on 7 May 2007 that the sedition law would be repealed.[34] The Crimes (Repeal of Seditious Offences) Amendment Act 2007 was passed on 24 October 2007, and entered into force on 1 January 2008.[35]\n\ndoc806014: Gun laws in New Zealand. Strikes in 1912 and 1913, a Communist revolution in Russia, and large numbers of ex-military guns coming into the country after World War I were used as justification for a new law in 1920. The new law required the registration of all firearms and issuance of a \"permit to procure\" before a firearm was transferred. Semi-automatic pistols were banned and a special permit was needed for other pistols (e.g. revolvers), with the intent of discouraging the carrying of concealed weapons. Few changes were seen for the next forty years as crime remained low and the country avoided political violence.\n\ndoc806024: Gun laws in New Zealand. In August 2009, the Police decided that any firearm, including single shot bolt action rifles, with a free-standing pistol grip that could allow the firearm to be shot inaccurately from the hip would be defined as an MSSA.[6] However, the High Court rejected this attempt in Lincoln v Police [2010] BCL 194; 33 TCL 11/2.\n\ndoc2145434: Law of New Zealand. Another problem with the idea that the Treaty established the rule of British law is that in 1840 M\ud6eeori still controlled New Zealand. Although the British had sent a governor, they had not backed him up with troops and for the first few years of supposed British sovereignty, Europeans were significantly outnumbered and outgunned by M\ud6eeori. M\ud6eeori generally obeyed British law in European settlements and when they or their chiefs chose to, but there was nothing to make them obey the law in areas they controlled, which until about the 1860s was most of the country. British law, and later New Zealand law as passed by the New Zealand parliament was slowly established over the country, but it remained ineffective in M\ud6eeori-controlled areas until the late nineteenth century at least. In practical terms, British-based law was established in New Zealand not through the Treaty of Waitangi but through conquest and settlement.\n\ndoc806007: Gun laws in New Zealand. For those that make an income from firearms. To sell restricted weapons the dealer also needs to have the appropriate endorsements.\n\ndoc1897169: Alcohol in New Zealand. For over a century, from the 1847 laws to 1948, M\u0101ori were restricted to buying alcohol from off-licensed vendors. In 1948 Parliament repealed most discriminatory measures, in part due to pressure from M\u0101ori servicemen returning from war.[7]\n\ndoc805999: Gun laws in New Zealand. Registration is not required under the law but the police carry out a regime similar to registration for all but \"A Category\" firearms. Firearms in any other category require a \"permit to procure\" before they are transferred.\n\ndoc38364: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The first petition was supported by Family First New Zealand, the ACT Party[28] and The Kiwi Party.[26]\n\ndoc466193: School corporal punishment. Corporal punishment in New Zealand schools was abolished in 1987, but wasn't abolished legislatively until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or ECE provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control.[108] Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in termination and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.[109]\n\ndoc253: Tobacco advertising. Tobacco advertising in New Zealand was outlawed with the passage of the Smokefree Amendment Act 1990.\n\ndoc667029: Legal tender. New Zealand has a complex history of legal tender. English law applied, as applicable to local circumstances, from either 6 January 1840, when the Governor of New South Wales by proclamation annexed New Zealand, or from 14 January 1840 when Captain Hobson Royal Navy was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor. The English Laws Act 1858 subsequently confirmed that English legislation passed prior to 14 January 1840 was and had been the law of New Zealand, as applicable to local circumstances. The (UK) Coinage Act 1816 therefore applied and British coins were confirmed as legal tender in New Zealand. Unusually, until 1989, the Reserve Bank did not have the right to issue coins as legal tender. Coins had to be issued by the Minister of Finance.\n\ndoc30318: Flag of New Zealand. In March 1994 the Prime Minister of New Zealand Jim Bolger made statements supporting a move towards a New Zealand republic.[17] In response Christian Democrat MP Graeme Lee introduced a Flags, Anthems, Emblems, and Names Protection Amendment Bill.[18] If passed, the Bill would have entrenched the Act that governs the flag and added New Zealand's anthems, requiring a majority of 65 percent of votes in Parliament before any future legislation could change the flag. The Bill passed its first reading but was defeated at its second reading, 26 votes to 37.\n\ndoc1897167: Alcohol in New Zealand. The liquor laws of New Zealand begin with the Colonisation of New Zealand and the implementation of English Common Law to New Zealand between 1840 and 1842, when New Zealand was jurisdictionally part of the Colony of New South Wales.[7]\n\ndoc1664411: New Zealanders. Agitation regarding Treaty of Waitangi violations intensified in the 1970s. The Waitangi Tribunal was set up in 1975 to consider alleged breaches, and in 1984 was empowered to look back to 1840.[47]\n\ndoc1324332: Capital punishment in New Zealand. Capital punishment in New Zealand first appeared in a codified form when it became a British territory in 1840, and was first employed in 1842.[1] It was last used in 1957, abolished for murder in 1961, and abolished altogether, including for treason, in 1989. During the period that it was in effect, 85 people were executed.\n\ndoc38354: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The law change has been described by supporters as aimed at making 'Aotearoa New Zealand [\u2026] a place where children are secure, confident, understand limits and boundaries and behave well \u2013 without physical punishment' and to 'protect children from assault'.[14]\n\ndoc38351: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. Bradford considers that smacking was illegal even before the Act was passed.[10] When an illegal activity is reported to the Police or to Child Youth and Family (CYF), they are required to investigate the reported abuse. Under subsection 4, The Police have the option of not prosecuting the parents 'where the offence is considered to be so inconsequential that there is no public interest in proceeding with a prosecution.'\n\ndoc1862075: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The Act also (Section 18(4)) ensures that non-New Zealand citizens lawfully in New Zealand shall not be required to leave except under a decision taken on grounds prescribed by law.\n\ndoc805994: Gun laws in New Zealand. Gun licenses are issued at the discretion of the police in New Zealand provided the police consider the person to be of good standing and without criminal, psychiatric or drug issues as well as meeting other conditions such as having suitable storage facilities. To be issued, they must be issued for a valid reason, which may not include self defense. Several different categories of licenses are permitted, with the lowest one permitting access to restricted semi-automatic rifles and shotguns, with limited capacity, while the higher levels which permit fully automatic weaponry and pistols are rarely issued to civilians.\n\ndoc1772171: Military history of New Zealand during World War II. The military history of New Zealand during World War II began when New Zealand entered the Second World War by declaring war on Nazi Germany with Great Britain. The state of war with Germany was officially held to have existed since 9:30 pm on 3 September 1939 (local time), simultaneous with that of Britain, but in fact the declaration of war was not made until confirmation had been received from Britain that their ultimatum to Germany had expired. The group (led by Peter Fraser as Prime Minister Mickey Savage was terminally ill) listened to the shortwave radio in Carl Berendsen's room in Parliament Buildings but were not certain what Neville Chamberlain had said because of static on the short-wave radio, and a coded telegraph message from London did not arrive until just before midnight as the messenger boy with the telegram in London took shelter because of a (false) air-raid warning. The Cabinet acted after hearing the Admiralty's notification to the fleet that war had broken out. The next day Cabinet approved nearly 30 war regulations as laid down in the War Book, and after completing the formalities with the Executive Council the Governor-General, Lord Galway, issued the Proclamation of War, backdated to 9.30 pm on 3 September.[1][2]\n\ndoc38355: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The first conviction under the new law occurred on 22 November 2007.[15] In the first five years of the law (June 2007 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c June 2012) there were eight prosecutions for smacking.[16][17]\n\ndoc1862095: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Several other remedies were suggested to be available in R v Taylor (1996) 14 CRNZ 426. These included a reduction in the penalty, police disciplinary proceedings, criminal prosecution, a declaration, or future-looking relief.[21] Other remedies have included special jury directions, and orders that witness testimony be disregarded.[22] It can often depend on the nature of the right breached as to what remedy will be appropriate to vindicate that breach.[23]\n\ndoc1324350: Capital punishment in New Zealand. Occasional calls to reinstate capital punishment still occur, but no major political party has made capital punishment an element of any of their election manifestos since the 1989 Abolition act.\n\ndoc2345864: Health care in New Zealand. Abortion is legal in New Zealand, if certain criteria are met. In general, either the health of the pregnant woman or the foetus must be in jeopardy. Additionally, two doctors must give their consent to the procedure. There were 18,380 abortions carried out in 2007, following a general increase in both the absolute number and per capita rate since 1991.\n\ndoc1049511: History of rugby union in New Zealand. The 1981 Springbok Tour, or The Tour, went down as one of the most controversial rugby tours ever. From July to September, the Springboks toured New Zealand. Rugby fans filled the stadiums, yet equal numbers of fans protested the games outside the stadiums. Police were divided into Red and Blue riot squads for the tour, and in preparation for possible trouble, all spectators were told to assemble in sports grounds at least an hour before kickoff. At a game at Rugby Park in Hamilton, around 350 protesters pulled down a fence and invaded the pitch. Police, already very worried, pulled the match when they found out a light plane piloted by a protester was headed to fly around the stadium. A protest turned violent in Wellington the following week, escalating the situation. During the final test match at Eden Park, a low flying plane dropped flour bombs over the pitch. These images were beamed around the world, and looked as though a civil crisis had engulfed New Zealand. A subsequent 1985 All Black tour was prevented by the High Court, but an unofficial tour took place the following year.\n\ndoc2295140: Auckland Harbour Bridge. The protest created a wide spectrum of responses in the media and in public perception, from being labelled a dangerous stunt representative of an increasingly lawless, anarchic society[50] to being considered a successful signal to authorities to give more weight to the demands and the public backing of the walk and cycleway proponents. Authorities noted that they were investigating whether any of the protesters would face fines or charges.[51] NZTA representatives noted that they were disappointed at what they considered the broken word of the organisers of the protest, and remarked that it would take 30 more years before walking and cycling could likely be provided (see also \"Second Harbour Crossing\" below).[49] NZTA were criticised as having brought the situation at least partly onto themselves by choosing the easy route of forbidding the protest crossing.[50] Several political protest marches (especially hikois) had been allowed to cross the bridge.\n\ndoc1862097: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. It is an on-going conversation amongst legal academics in New Zealand as to whether there should be an entrenched constitutional bill of rights that gives the court the power to strike down inconsistent legislation.[25] This would provide a remedy to breaches of the Bill of Rights Act 1990 as the courts could uphold the right, rather than finding it to be subservient under s4. The UN Human Rights Committee criticised New Zealand for the lack of court power to strike down legislation inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act 1990. They equated this lack of power with a lack of human rights protection[26] Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler published a book in 2016 entitled A Constitution for Aotearoa New Zealand[27] that laid out a proposed entrenched bill of rights, including a judicial power of strike down. This was intended to start a conversation in New Zealand as to whether entrenching their bill of rights in a constitution was the way forward.\n\ndoc159166: Drunk driving law by country. New Zealand operates a program called Compulsory Breath Testing, which allows police to stop motorists at any time. CBT is usually carried out at roadside checkpoints but mobile patrol cars can also randomly stop motorists to administer a test. The police also carry out roadside drug tests upon motorists they suspect have used drugs.[90]\n\ndoc806010: Gun laws in New Zealand. F Endorsement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Dealers staff licence\n\ndoc323122: Overview of gun laws by nation. New Zealand's gun laws comprise the Arms Act of 1983,[147]\nArms Amendment Act 1992,[148]\nand Arms Regulations 1992,[149]\nand focus mainly on vetting firearm owners. A firearms licence may be issued by police to applicants who attend a safety lecture, pass a written test on safety and the Arms Code, and have secure storage for firearms and ammunition; the police will also interview the applicant and two references to be certain the applicant is \"fit and proper\" to own a firearm. Having criminal associations, a history of domestic violence, mental instability, or alcohol or drug abuse almost always result in the application being denied. Misbehavior involving firearms commonly leads to a firearms licence being revoked by police. Even when licensed, a person may only be in possession of a firearm for a particular lawful, proper and sufficient purpose,[150]\nwhich the NZ Police claim specifically excludes self-defence, however this is not written in the Arms Act or supporting regulations.[151]\n\ndoc1513187: Gangs in New Zealand. In 2009 the Wanganui District Council voted to ban gang patches, but it was overturned following a judicial review instigated by the Hells Angels.[71] The council tried again in 2011, this time restricting the ban to just the central business district, malls and parks.[72]\n\ndoc1862087: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A common remedy to the Bill of Rights Act 1990 is that the evidence obtained through breaching a right is inadmissible in court. This developed in the courts as a presumption of exclusion but was then lessened to a balancing exercise where various factors are weighed up to determine the admissibility of evidence tainted by a breach of the Bill of Rights Act 1990.[7] This remedy is now reflected in section 30 of the Evidence Act 2006.[8]\n\ndoc1862082: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Fair Trial Everyone who is charged with an offence has the minimum right:\n\ndoc40106: Legal issues in airsoft. Air-powered firearms are legal to possess and use in New Zealand, provided that the person is either over 18 years of age or 16 with a firearms license. A person under 18 may not possess an air gun, but may use one under the direct supervision of someone over 18 or a firearms license holder (Direct supervision requires that the license holder be able to take control of the firearm at all times, so they must remain within arms reach).\n\ndoc805993: Gun laws in New Zealand. About 230,000 licensed firearms owners own and use New Zealand's estimated 1.1 million firearms.[1] As in Australia, but unlike the US and Canada, gun laws usually gain the support of both major parties before they are passed. Guns are not currently a major political issue, but have been immediately after the Aramoana massacre in 1990, and the Scottish Dunblane and Australian Port Arthur massacres in 1996.\n\ndoc2317551: Treason. Very few people have been prosecuted for the act of treason in New Zealand and none have been prosecuted in recent years.[21]\n\ndoc2410390: New Zealand nuclear-free zone. Initial seeds were sown for New Zealand's 1987 nuclear free zone legislation in the late 1950s with the formation of the local Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) organisation between 1957 and 1959.[9][10] In 1959, responding to rising public concern following the British hydrogen bomb tests in Australia and the Pacific, New Zealand voted in the UN to condemn nuclear testing while the UK, US and France voted against, and Australia abstained.[11] In 1961, CND urged the New Zealand government to declare that it would not acquire or use nuclear weapons and to withdraw from nuclear alliances such as ANZUS. In 1963, the Auckland CND campaign submitted its 'No Bombs South of the Line' petition to the New Zealand parliament with 80,238 signatures calling on the government to sponsor an international conference to discuss establishing a nuclear-free-zone in the southern hemisphere. It was the biggest petition in the nation since the one in 1893 which demanded that women must have the right to vote.[12]\n\ndoc2020110: Graffiti. In February 2008 Helen Clark, the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in Auckland during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of manslaughter.\n\ndoc1049521: History of rugby union in New Zealand. New Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with South Africa, especially through rugby union. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against M\u0101ori players, since the apartheid political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that M\u0101ori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being M\u0101ori, this was agreed to, and M\u0101ori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some M\u0101ori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at M\u0101ori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group Halt All Racist Tours was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which M\u0101ori were central, and M\u0101ori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by P\u0101keh\u0101 (white New Zealanders).\n\ndoc952715: Islam in New Zealand. In 2006, two newspapers in New Zealand decided to republish controversial Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. The Muslim community registered their displeasure through press statements and a small peaceful march in Auckland. The editors said they did not mean offence but would not back down. Prime Minister Helen Clark and opposition leader Don Brash both made statements that the cartoons were not appreciated if they deeply offended members of the New Zealand community, but that such decisions were for editors to make, not politicians. Muslim leaders and the editors got together with the Race Relations office, and Jewish and Christian representatives in Wellington. As a result of this meeting the editors said they would not apologise but in good faith would refrain from publishing the offending images again. The New Zealand Muslim leadership, through the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIAN]Z, then proceeded in good faith to consider the matter closed, and drafted letters to 52 Muslim countries reversing their earlier stance and asking that New Zealand products not be boycotted.[18][19]\n\ndoc2317549: Treason. Every one owing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand commits treason who, within or outside New Zealand,\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\n\ndoc2222778: New Zealand nationality law. This law has been controversial. A 2003 petition asking the Parliament of New Zealand to repeal the Act attracted 100,000 signatures, and the Samoan rights group Mau Sitiseni filed a petition on the issue with the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2007.[6]\n\ndoc1049519: History of rugby union in New Zealand. The role of the NZ police also became more controversial as a result of the tour.\n\ndoc1310356: New Zealand national rugby union team. The 1981 South African tour to New Zealand sparked protests against South Africa's apartheid policy, the likes of which had not been seen in New Zealand since the 1951 waterfront dispute.[67][68] The NZRU had invited the Springboks to tour as the Muldoon government refused to involve politics in sport.[69] Although New Zealand won the test series, two of the tour's provincial games were cancelled and the whole tour was marred by violence and protest.[70] The third and final test match of the tour is sometimes known as the Flour Bomb test, as an anti-apartheid activist in a Cessna light aircraft dropped leaflets, flares, a parachute-supported banner reading \"Biko\" and flour bombs into Auckland's Eden Park throughout the match, felling a New Zealand player. During the tour the country experienced unrest, and the tour had a significant impact on New Zealand society.[67][70][71]\n\ndoc806009: Gun laws in New Zealand. New class of restricted weapon that was created after the Aramoana shooting spree. At the time anyone with an MSSA that wanted to keep it in that configuration was given a E endorsement (after going through the vetting and extra security requirements). But presently few are issued. Common reasons for wanting an E endorsement are professional pest destruction, collecting, 3-gun and service rifle shooting. Those people that did not want the extra hassle and expense of the endorsement converted their rifles into 'A' configuration by removing the components that made it an 'E'.\n\ndoc430006: History of New Zealand. Feminists by the 1880s were using the rhetoric of \"white slavery\" to reveal men's sexual and social oppression of women. By demanding that men take responsibility for the right of women to walk the streets in safety, New Zealand feminists deployed the rhetoric of white slavery to argue for women's sexual and social freedom.[55] Middle class women successfully mobilised to stop prostitution, especially during the First World War.[56]\n\ndoc40108: Legal issues in airsoft. Police, New Zealand, Airguns Factsheet, retrieved 24 July 2007\u00c2\n\ndoc2295139: Auckland Harbour Bridge. On Sunday, 24 May 2009, thousands of people crossed the bridge as a part of a protest by GetAcross against the bridge not providing walking and cycling access, and against what the group perceives to be the authorities' negative and obstructionist attitude towards such access.[49] A crossing either as part of the protest or as part of the official 50-year anniversary celebrations had been forbidden by NZTA because of the costs and traffic difficulties claimed for a managed crossing. However, after several speeches, including by Auckland Regional Council Chairman Mike Lee, several people made their way around the police cordon onto the bridge. At that stage police closed the northbound lanes to traffic, bringing State Highway 1 to a stop. The remainder of the protesters moving onto the bridge, which was not resisted any more by the police. No accidents, violence or arrests were reported,[49] and protesters left the bridge approximately an hour later, many having crossed to the North Shore and back.\n\ndoc2245146: Constitution of New Zealand. New Zealand law has three principal sources: English common law; certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689); and statutes of the Parliament of New Zealand. In interpreting common law, there is a rebuttable presumption in support of uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions. Non-uniformity arises where the New Zealand courts consider local conditions to warrant it or where the law has been codified by New Zealand statute.[3] The maintenance of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London as the final court of appeal and judges' practice of tending to follow British decisions, even though, technically, they are not bound by them, both bolstered this presumption. The Supreme Court of New Zealand, which was established by legislation in October 2003 and which replaced the Privy Council for future appeals, has continued to develop the presumption.\n\ndoc2564629: New Zealand national cricket team. Perhaps New Zealand's most infamous one-day match was the \"Under arm\" match against Australia at the MCG in 1981. Requiring six runs to tie the match off the final ball, Australian captain Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to \"bowl\" the ball underarm along the wicket to prevent New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie from hitting a six. The Australian umpires ruled the move as legal even though to this day many believe it was one of the most unsporting decisions made in cricket.\n\ndoc2145439: Law of New Zealand. New Zealand contract law was initially derived from the English model. Since 1969, however, a series of Acts of Parliament altered this, and New Zealand contract law is now 'largely... distinct from other jurisdictions'.[3] The main distinction of New Zealand contract law is the wide discretionary power given to courts in granting relief. Although these changes were initially opposed due to fears that they would make the remedy of contractual disputes unpredictable and increase levels of litigation, it is generally agreed that this has not happened, and that the laws are working satisfactorily.[4]\n\ndoc2410389: New Zealand nuclear-free zone. After the Disarmament and Arms Control Act was passed by the Lange-led Labour government, the United States government suspended its ANZUS obligations to New Zealand. The legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity.[6][7] New Zealand's three decade anti-nuclear campaign is the only successful movement of its type in the world which resulted in the nation's nuclear-weapon-free zone status being enshrined in legislation.[8]\n\ndoc2397926: Education in New Zealand. Bullying is a widespread issue in New Zealand schools. In 2007, one in five New Zealand high school students reported being cyber-bullied.[44] In regard to physical bullying, an international study in 2009 found New Zealand had the second highest incidence of bullying out of the 40 countries surveyed.[45]\n\n"
