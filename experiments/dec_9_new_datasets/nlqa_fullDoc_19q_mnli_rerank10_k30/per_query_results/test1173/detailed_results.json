The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc41605: Names of China. Sinologists usually use \"Chinese\" in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of Zhongguo, to the Han ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the overseas Chinese.\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc1032075: China proper. While the Manchu Qing sought used China (Zhongguo) to describe non-Han areas, however some Han scholar-officials opposed the Qing Manchu Emperor's use of Zhongguo to refer to non-Han areas, using Zhongguo to mark a distinction between the culturally Han Chinese areas and the territory newly brought into the Manchu Qing empire. In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China. Chinese names for China, aside from Zhongguo, include Zhonghua (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), Huaxia (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), Shenzhou (\u795e\u5dde) and Jiuzhou (\u4e5d\u5dde). Han (\u6f22/\u6c49) and Tang (\u5510) are common names given for the Chinese ethnicity. The People's Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) and Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) are the official names for the two contemporary sovereign states currently claiming sovereignty over the traditional area of China. \"Mainland China\" is used to refer to areas under the jurisdiction by the PRC usually excluding Hong Kong and Macau.\n\ndoc41603: Names of China. The term \"China\" can also be used to refer to:\n\ndoc41567: Names of China. Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc1713758: Made in China. Made in China or Product of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u5236\u9020; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u88fd\u9020; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u00ecz\u00e0o,) is a country of origin label affixed to products manufactured in the People's Republic of China.\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc41577: Names of China. Qing official Zhang Deyi objected to the western European name \"China\" and said that China referred to itself as Zhonghua in response to a European who asked why Chinese used the term guizi to refer to all Europeans.[32]\n\ndoc41619: Names of China. Japanese: Morokoshi (\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057; variously written in kanji as \u5510 or \u5510\u571f). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a kun reading of the Chinese compound \u8af8\u8d8a Zh\u016byu\u00e8 or \u767e\u8d8a B\u01ceiyu\u00e8 as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\ndoc940968: Chinese characters.

There are also names for China that are derived from the languages of other ethnic groups other than the Han; examples include \"Cathay\" from the Khitan language and \"Tabgach\" from Tuoba.\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41596: Names of China. The name New China has been frequently applied to China by the Communist Party of China as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state. This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the Cold War as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\" to distinguish it from the Republic of China which is commonly called \"Taiwan\", \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\". In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, \"China\" is often used to refer to mainland China to the exclusion of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. In reporting by Western news services, \"China\" typically refers to the People's Republic of China including Hong Kong and Macau,[citation needed] particularly when reporting politics.\n\ndoc2354286: Guangzhou. Gu\u01cengzh\u014du is the pinyin romanisation of the Chinese name \u5ee3\u5dde, which was simplified in mainland China to \u5e7f\u5dde in the 1950s. The name of the city is taken from the ancient Guang Province (Guang Zhou), after it had become the prefecture's seat of government, which is how some other Chinese cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou and Fuzhou got their names. The character \u5ee3 or \u5e7f\u2014which also appears in the names of the provinces Guangdong and Guangxi, together called the Liangguang\u2014means \"broad\" or \"expansive\" and refers to the intention to dispense imperial grace broadly in the region with the founding of county of Guangxin in Han Dynasty.\n\ndoc2252912: Huang (surname). Huang (/\u02c8hw\u0251\u02d0\u014b/;[1] simplified Chinese: \u9ec4; traditional Chinese: \u9ec3) is a Chinese surname that means \"Yellow\". While Hu\u00e1ng is the pinyin romanization of the word, it may also be romanised as Hwang, Huong, Houang, Hoang, Wong, Waan, Wan, Waon, Hwong, Vong, Hung, Hong, Bong, Eng, Ng, Uy, Wee, Oi, Oei, Oey, Ooi, Oof, Ong, or Ung due to pronunciations of the word in different dialects and languages.\n\ndoc41597: Names of China.

Tianzhu was also referred to as Wutianzhu (\u4e94\u5929\u7afa, literally \"Five Indias\"), because there were five geographical regions in India known to the Chinese: Central, Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern India. The monk Xuanzang also referred to India as Wu Yin or \"Five Inds\".[5]\n\ndoc416493: Shanghai. Shanghai is officially abbreviated \u6caa (H\u00f9/Wu) in Chinese,[24] a contraction of \u6caa\u6e0e (H\u00f9 D\u00fa/Vu Doh, lit \"Harpoon Ditch\"),[25][26] a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean.[25] This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.\n\ndoc1317375: Talk:Chinese name.

The English name \"Canton\" derived from Portuguese Cant\ucc3eo[27] or Cidade de Cant\ucc3eo,[28] a muddling of dialectical pronunciations of \"Guangdong\"[29][30] (e.g., Hakka K\ucc98ng-t\uccadng). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was also used in English in reference to Guangdong generally.[31] It was adopted as the Postal Map Romanization of Guangzhou and remained in common use until the gradual adoption of pinyin. As an adjective, it is still used in describing the people, language, cuisine and culture of Guangzhou and the surrounding Liangguang region. The 19th-century name \"Kwang-chow foo\"[32] derived from Nanjing dialect of Mandarin and the town's status as a prefectural capital.\n\ndoc41599: Names of China. The official name of the Republic of China in various official languages and scripts:\n\ndoc2553911: Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng. The word \u0111\u1ed3ng is from the term \u0111\u1ed3ng ti\u1ec1n (\"money\"), a loanword from the Chinese t\u00f3ng qi\u00e1n (Traditional Chinese: \u9285\u9322; Simplified Chinese: \u94dc\u94b1). The term refers to Chinese bronze coins used as currency during the dynastic periods of China and Vietnam. The term h\u00e0o is a loanword from the Chinese h\u00e1o (Chinese: \u6beb), meaning a tenth of a currency unit. The term xu comes from French sous meaning \"penny\". The sign is encoded U+20AB \u20ab DONG SIGN (HTML\u00a0&#8363;).\n\ndoc1872866: Chinese name. Modern Chinese names consist of a surname known as xing (\u59d3, x\u00ecng), which comes first and is usually but not always monosyllabic, followed by a personal name called ming (\u540d, m\u00edng), which is nearly always mono- or disyllabic.  Prior to the 20th century, educated Chinese also utilized a \"courtesy name\" or \"style name\" called zi (\u5b57, z\u00ec) by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends.\n\ndoc1872868: Chinese name. Although some terms in the ancient Chinese naming system, such as x\u00ecng (\u59d3) and m\u00edng (\u540d), are still used today, they were used in different and more complex ways than in modern China.\n\ndoc470974: Names for India. Tianzhu or Tenjiku (Chinese and Japanese: \u5929\u7afa) (originally pronounced xien-t'juk) is the historical East Asian name for India that comes from the Chinese transliteration of the Persian Hindu, which itself is derived from the Sanskrit Sindhu, the native name of the Indus River.[5] Tianzhu is one of several Chinese transliterations of Sindhu. Shendu (\u8eab\u6bd2) appears in Sima Qian's Shiji and Tiandu (\u5929\u7be4) is used in the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han).[19] Yintejia (\u5370\u7279\u4f3d) comes from the Kuchean Indaka, another transliteration of Hindu.[5] A detailed account of Tianzhu is given in the \"Xiyu Zhuan\" (Record of the Western Regions) in the Hou Hanshu compiled by Fan Ye (398\u2013445):\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc41586: Names of China. This name means Divine Land (\u795e\u5dde; pinyin: Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou. It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\ndoc41587: Names of China. This name, Four Seas (\u56db\u6d77; pinyin: s\u00ech\u01cei), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world. It came from the ancient notion that the world is flat and surrounded by sea.\n\ndoc1155978: Huawei. Huawei is the official translation of the firm's Chinese name (simplified Chinese: \u534e\u4e3a; traditional Chinese: \u83ef\u70ba; pinyin: Hu\u00e1w\u00e9i). The character can also mean \"splendid\" or \"magnificent\", but nowadays mostly refers to \"China\" or \"(ethnic) Chinese\" (see also Names of China). It is common for Chinese companies to use this word, another example being the Taiwanese company Asus (simplified Chinese: \u534e\u7855; traditional Chinese: \u83ef\u78a9; pinyin: Hu\u00e1shu\u00f2; literally: \"Chinese-Eminent\") that was founded back in 1989. The second character of Huawei's name, \u4e3a, means \"action\" or \"achievement\", thus Huawei literally means \"Chinese achievement\".[26]\n\ndoc68040: Chinese dragon. There are a number of places in China called \"Nine Dragons\", the most famous being Kowloon (in Cantonese) in Hong Kong. The part of the Mekong in Vietnam is known as C\u1eedu Long, with the same meaning.\n\ndoc1111198: Manchuria. Manchuria has also been referred to as Guandong (traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u6771; simplified Chinese: \u5173\u4e1c; pinyin: Gu\u0101nd\u014dng), which literally means \"east of the pass\", and similarly Guanwai (\u95dc\u5916; \u5173\u5916; Gu\u0101nw\u00e0i; \"outside the pass\"), a reference to Shanhai Pass in Qinhuangdao in today's Hebei, at the eastern end of the Great Wall of China. This usage is seen in the expression Chu\u01ceng Gu\u0101nd\u014dng (literally \"Rushing into Guandong\") referring to the mass migration of Han Chinese to Manchuria in the 19th and 20th centuries. The name Guandong later came to be used more narrowly for the area of the Kwantung Leased Territory on the Liaodong Peninsula. It is not to be confused with the southern province of Guangdong.\n\ndoc1454202: Taiwan. The official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u570b), to refer to itself, which derives from zh\u014dng (\"central\" or \"middle\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state, nation-state\"), [e] A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty in reference to its royal demesne[f] and the name was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qingera .[34] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as \"Nationalist China\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\").[36] It was a member of the United Nations representing \"China\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People's Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\"[37] The Republic of China participates in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\" due to diplomatic pressure from the People's Republic of China. For instance, it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984, and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.[38]\n\ndoc1471491: Languages of China.

In his Daoyi Zhil\u00fce (1349), Wang Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of it near to Penghu.[31] Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name Ry\u016bky\u016b is the Japanese form of Li\u00faqi\u00fa. The name also appears in the Book of Sui (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.[32]\n\ndoc2144141: List of rulers of China. \u6e56\u5357\u7bc0\u5ea6\u4f7f\n\ndoc2144142: List of rulers of China. \u6e56\u5357\u7bc0\u5ea6\u4f7f\n\ndoc416494: Shanghai. Another alternative name for Shanghai is Sh\u0113n (\u7533) or Sh\u0113nch\u00e9ng (\u7533\u57ce, \"Shen City\"), from Lord Chunshen, a third-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the state of Chu, whose fief included modern Shanghai.[25] Sports teams and newspapers in Shanghai often use Shen in their names, such as Shanghai Shenhua F.C. and Shen Bao.\n\ndoc1712456: Mainland China.

The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc41600: Names of China. Names used in the rest of Asia, especially East and Southeast Asia, are usually derived directly from words in a language of China. Those languages belonging to a former dependency (tributary) or Chinese-influenced country have an especially similar pronunciation to that of Chinese. Those used in Indo-European languages, however, have indirect names that came via other routes and bear little resemblance to what is used in China.\n\ndoc2175382: Chiang Kai-shek. In 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name Chiang Kai-shek (Chinese: \u8523\u4ecb\u77f3; Pinyin: \u00a0Jiang Jieshi\u00a0(help\u00b7info); Wade-Giles: Chiang Chieh-shih) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded: Voice of the Army (Chinese: \u8ecd\u8072). Jieshi is the Pinyin romanization of this name, based on Mandarin, but the most recognized romanized rendering is Kai-shek which is in Cantonese romanization. As the republicans were based in Canton (a Cantonese speaking area, now commonly known as Guangdong province), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in Wade-Giles.\n\ndoc1872890: Chinese name. a. only for Royalty and Emperors; b. only for Royalty and Emperors' reigns.\n\ndoc2480789: Demographics of China.

Dulimbai Gurun is the Manchu name for China (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Middle Kingdom\").[6][7][8] After conquering the Ming, the Manchu Qing identified their state as \"China\" (Zhongguo), and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu. The Manchu Qing Emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including both \"China proper\" and present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas in \"China proper\", proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba, Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing.[9]\n\ndoc210809: Varieties of Chinese.

In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang moved his capital from Shangjing to Yanjing and the city was renamed Zhongdu (\u4e2d\u90fd) or the \"Central Capital\".[30] For the first time in its history, the city of Beijing became a political capital of a major dynasty.\n\ndoc41598: Names of China. Since its founding in 1912, the Republic of China, or ROC, has sometimes been referred to as \"Republican China\" or \"Republican Era\" (\u6c11\u570b\u6642\u4ee3), in contrast to the empire it replaced, or as \"Nationalist China\", after the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). \u4e2d\u83ef (Zhonghua) is a term that pertains to \"China\" while \u6c11\u570b (m\u00edngu\u00f3), literally \"people's country\", stands for \"republic\".[39][40] With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the Chinese Civil War, the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of Taiwan and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"Taiwan\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See Taiwan Independence.) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War, the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" (\u532a\u5340) by the ROC). In addition, the ROC, due to pressure from the PRC, was forced to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u53f0\u5317) whenever it participates in international forums or most sporting events such as the Olympic Games.\n\ndoc41591: Names of China. The name Tang (\u5510; pinyin: T\u00e1ng) comes from the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age. It was during the Tang Dynasty that South China was finally and fully Sinicized; Tang would become synonymous with China in Southern China and it is usually Southern Chinese who refer to themselves as \"Tang ren\" (\u5510\u4eba, pinyin: T\u00e1ngr\u00e9n; literally: \"People of Tang\").[35] For example, the sinicization and rapid development of Guangdong during the Tang period would lead the Cantonese to refer to themselves as Tong-yan (\u5510\u4eba) in Cantonese, while China is called Tong-saan (\u5510\u5c71; pinyin: T\u00e1ngsh\u0101n; literally: \"Tang Mountain\").[36] Chinatowns worldwide, often dominated by Southern Chinese, also became referred to Tong-yan-gaai (\u5510\u4eba\u8857; pinyin: T\u00e1ngr\u00e9nji\u0113; literally: \"Tang people street\"). The Cantonese term is recorded as Tongsan in Old Malay as one of the local terms for China, along with the Sanskrit-derived Cina. It is still used in Malaysia today, usually in a derogatory sense.\n\ndoc2491345: Chinese nobility. The Yan of Langye \u7405\u90aa\u984f\u6c0f spawned Yan Zhitui.\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc761400: Confucianism. R\u00faji\u00e0o and K\u01d2ngji\u00e0o contain the Chinese character ji\u00e0o, the noun \"teaching\" or \"transmission,\" used in such terms as \"education,\" or \"educator.\" The term, however, is notably used to construct the names of religions in Chinese: the terms for Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and other religions in Chinese all end with ji\u00e0o.\n\ndoc41594: Names of China. D\u00e0l\u00f9 (\u5927\u9678/\u5927\u9646; pinyin: d\u00e0l\u00f9), literally \"big continent\" or \"mainland\" in this context, is used as a short form of Zh\u014dngg\u00fao D\u00e0l\u00f9 (\u4e2d\u570b\u5927\u9678/\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646, Mainland China), excluding (depending on the context) Hong Kong and Macau, and/or Taiwan. This term is used in official context in both the mainland and Taiwan, when referring to the mainland as opposed to Taiwan. In certain contexts, it is equivalent to the term Neidi (\u5185\u5730; pinyin: n\u00e8id\u00ec, literally \"the inner land\"). While Neidi generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\ndoc428937: Shang dynasty. The name Y\u012bn (\u6bb7) is used by Sima Qian for the dynasty, and in the \"current text\" version of the Bamboo Annals for both the dynasty and its final capital. It has been a popular name for the Shang throughout history. Since the Records of Emperors and Kings by Huangfu Mi (3rd century AD), it has often been used specifically to describe the later half of the Shang dynasty. In Japan and Korea, the Shang are still referred to almost exclusively as the Yin (In) dynasty. However it seems to have been a Zhou name for the earlier dynasty. The word does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as Sh\u0101ng (\u5546), and the capital as D\u00e0y\u00ec Sh\u0101ng (\u5927\u9091\u5546 \"Great Settlement Shang\").[5] It also does not appear in securely-dated Western Zhou bronze inscriptions.[6]\n\ndoc1317352: Talk:Chinese name. I understand also that many chinese do NOT have middle name, but this is NOT always the case.\n\ndoc68052: Chinese dragon. Non-Imperial Chinese dragon in Shanghai\n\ndoc1471488: Languages of China. (Possibly the ancient N\u00e1nm\u00e1n \u5357\u86ee, \u5357\u883b)\n\ndoc41617: Names of China. Japanese: Kara (\u304b\u3089; variously written in kanji as \u5510 or \u6f22). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as Korea, and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a metonymic extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of Gaya.\n\ndoc1408140: Qin dynasty. Huang-Lao\n\ndoc41601: Names of China. English, most Indo-European languages, and many others use various forms of the name \"China\" and the prefix \"Sino-\" or \"Sin-\" from the Latin Sina.[41][42] Europeans had knowledge of a country known as Thina or Sina from the early period;[43] the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea from perhaps the first century AD recorded a country known as Thin (\u03b8\u03af\u03bd).[44] The English name for \"China\" itself is derived from Middle Persian (Ch\u012bn\u012b \u0686\u06cc\u0646). This modern word \"China\" was first used by Europeans starting with Portuguese explorers of the 16th century \u2013 it was first recorded in 1516 in the journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[45][46] The journal was translated and published in England in 1555.[47]\n\ndoc247739: Chinese culture. In modern China, there are 56 officially labelled ethnic groups in China.[12] Throughout history, many groups have merged into neighboring ethnicities or disappeared. At the same time, many within the Han identity have maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions. The term Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\uff0c\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u65cf) has been used to describe the notion of Chinese nationalism in general. Much of the traditional identity within the community has to do with distinguishing the family name.\n\ndoc41585: Names of China. The name Jiuzhou (\u4e5d\u5dde; pinyin: ji\u01d4 zh\u014du) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of Warring States period of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE). During that time, the Yellow River river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, Yu the Great, who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult Zhou for more information.)\n\ndoc1471486: Languages of China. (Possibly the ancient B\u01ceiyu\u00e8 \u767e\u8d8a)\n\ndoc2058823: Peking opera. Jing (\u51c0): refer to painted-face role, know popularly as Hualian, divided into Zhengjing (\u6b63\u51c0), Fujing (\u526f\u51c0), Wujing (\u6b66\u51c0), Maojing (\u6bdb\u51c0)\n\ndoc862443: Tao. The tao/dao \"the way\" English word of Chinese origin has three meanings, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\ndoc2211621: Spratly Islands dispute. Vietnam's response to China's claim is that Chinese records on Qianli Changsha and Wanli Shitang are in fact records about non-Chinese territories.[60] For example, Qianli Changsha and Wanli Shitang were referred to in the ancient Chinese texts Ling Wai Dai Da[61] and Zhu Fan Zhi[62] as being in the Sea of Jiaozhi, Jiaozhi being the old name for a Chinese province in modern-day northern Vietnam, or as writings on foreign countries.\n\ndoc2089441: Mandarin Chinese. but not as Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0.[11]\n\ndoc229927: Yangtze. The English name Yangtze derives from the Chinese name Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng (\u00a0listen), which refers to the lowest 435 km of the river between Nanjing and Shanghai. The whole river is known in China as Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng (\u00a0listen; literally: \"Long River\").\n\ndoc2114593: Mongolian language. The Yuan dynasty referred to the Mongolian language in Chinese as \"Guoyu\" (Chinese: \u570b\u8a9e), which means \"National language\", a term also used by other non-Han dynasties to refer to their languages such as the Manchu language during the Qing dynasty, the Jurchen language during the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), the Khitan language during the Liao dynasty, and the Xianbei language during the Northern Wei.\n\ndoc2345375: Chin (disambiguation). Chin may also refer to:\n\ndoc1375163: South China Morning Post. From its founding, during the Qing dynasty (Ching dynasty) until 1913, one year after the establishment of the Republic of China, it was known, in Chinese, as \u300a\u5357\u6e05\u65e9\u5831\u300b (Naamcing Zoubou, lit. South Qing Morning Post). In 1913, its Chinese name was changed to \u300a\u5357\u83ef\u65e9\u5831\u300b (lit. South China Morning Post), and has remained as such since then. The Chinese name of Sunday Morning Post is \u300a\u661f\u671f\u65e5\u5357\u83ef\u65e9\u5831\u300b (Singkeijat Naamwaa Zoubou lit. Sunday South China Morning Post).\n\ndoc1791994: Ethnic minorities in China. By definition, these ethnic minority groups, together with the Han majority, make up the greater Chinese nationality known as Zhonghua Minzu. Chinese minorities alone are referred to as \"Shaoshu Minzu\".\n\ndoc1729648: Vladivostok. In modern-day China, Vladivostok is officially known by the transliteration F\u00fal\u0101d\u00edw\u00f2s\u012btu\u014dk\u00e8 (\u7b26\u62c9\u8fea\u6c83\u65af\u6258\u514b), although the historical Chinese name Haishenwai is still often used in common parlance and outside mainland China to refer to the city.[13][14] According to the provisions of the Chinese government, all maps published in China have to bracket the city's Chinese name.[15]\n\ndoc2528195: Geographical renaming. In the People's Republic of China\n\ndoc1219722: Scarborough Shoal. In 1935, China, as the Republic of China (ROC), regarded the shoal as part of the Zhongsha Islands. That position has since been maintained by both the ROC, which now governs Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China (PRC).[50] In 1947 the shoal was given the name Minzhu Jiao (Chinese: \u6c11\u4e3b\u7901; literally: \"Democracy Reef\"). In 1983 the People's Republic of China renamed it Huangyan Island with Minzhu Jiao reserved as a second name.[51] In 1956 Beijing protested Philippine remarks that the South China Sea islands in close proximity to Philippine territory should belong to the Philippines. China's Declaration on the territorial Sea, promulgated in 1958, says in part,\n\ndoc439812: Christianity in China. Terms for Christianity in Chinese include: \"Protestantism\" (Chinese: \u57fa\u7763\u6559\u65b0\u6559; pinyin: J\u012bd\u016b ji\u00e0o x\u012bn ji\u00e0o; literally: \"Christ religion's new religion\"); \"Catholicism\" (Chinese: \u5929\u4e3b\u6559; pinyin: Ti\u0101nzh\u01d4 ji\u00e0o; literally: \"Heavenly Lord religion\"); and Eastern Orthodox Christians (Chinese: \u6771\u6b63\u6559/\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559; pinyin: D\u014dng zh\u00e8ng ji\u00e0o; literally: \"Eastern Orthodox religion\"). The whole of Orthodox Christianity is named Zh\u00e8ng ji\u00e0o (\u6b63\u6559). Christians in China are referred to as \"Christ followers/believers\" (Chinese: \u57fa\u7763\u5f92; pinyin: J\u012bd\u016b t\u00fa) or \"Christ religion followers/believers\" (Chinese: \u57fa\u7763\u6559\u5f92; pinyin: J\u012bd\u016b ji\u00e0o t\u00fa).\n\ndoc679392: Names of Japan. The modern Shanghainese pronunciation of Japan is Zeppen [z\u0259\u0294p\u0259n].  In modern Japanese, Cipangu is transliterated as \u30c1\u30d1\u30f3\u30b0 which in turn can be transliterated into English as Chipangu, Jipangu, Zipangu, Jipang, or Zipang. Jipangu (\u30b8\u30d1\u30f3\u30b0 (Zipangu)) as an obfuscated name for Japan has recently come into vogue for Japanese films, anime, video games, etc.\n\ndoc2144103: List of rulers of China. Chinese convention: use \"Tang\" + temple name (except for Emperor Shang and Emperor Ai; Emperor Xuanzong (\u5510\u7384\u5b97) is sometimes referred as Emperor Ming of Tang Dynasty (\u5510\u660e\u7687))\n\ndoc1872882: Chinese name. In mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the Hanyu Pinyin system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed,[12] it remains in common use and has become the transcription system of the government of Singapore, the United Nations, and the International Organization for Standardization.[13] After many decades of avoiding its use, Taiwan formally adopted Pinyin as its \"New Phonetic System\" in 2009,[14][15] although it continues to allow its citizens to use other romanizations on official documents such as passports. The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as \"q\", \"x\", and \"z\"; when tones are included, they are noted via tone marks. In Pinyin, \u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771 is written as M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng.\n\ndoc1032073: China proper. When the Qing conquered Dzungaria in 1759, they proclaimed that the new land was absorbed into \"China\" (Dulimbai Gurun) in a Manchu language memorial.[10][11][12] The Qing expounded on their ideology that they were bringing together the \"outer\" non-Han Chinese like the Inner Mongols, Eastern Mongols, Oirat Mongols, and Tibetans together with the \"inner\" Han Chinese, into \"one family\" united in the Qing state, showing that the diverse subjects of the Qing were all part of one family, the Qing used the phrase \"Zhong Wai Yi Jia\" (\u4e2d\u5916\u4e00\u5bb6) or \"Nei Wai Yi Jia\" (\u5167\u5916\u4e00\u5bb6, \"interior and exterior as one family\"), to convey this idea of \"unification\" of the different peoples.[13] A Manchu language version of a treaty with the Russian Empire concerning criminal jurisdiction over bandits called people from the Qing as \"people of the Central Kingdom (Dulimbai Gurun)\" [14]\n\ndoc2009660: Religion in Japan. Most Chinese people in Japan practice the Chinese folk religion (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u95f4\u5b97\u6559 or \u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u95f4\u4fe1\u4ef0; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 m\u00ednji\u0101n z\u014dngji\u00e0o or Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 m\u00ednji\u0101n x\u00ecny\u01ceng; Japanese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u6c11\u4fd7\u5b97\u6559; r\u014dmaji: Ch\u016bgoku no minzoku sh\u016bky\u014d), also known as Shenism (Chinese: \u795e\u6559; pinyin: Sh\u00e9nji\u00e0o; Japanese pronunciation: Shinky\u014d), that is very similar to Japanese Shinto.\n\n"

The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc41605: Names of China. Sinologists usually use \"Chinese\" in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of Zhongguo, to the Han ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the overseas Chinese.\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc1032075: China proper. While the Manchu Qing sought used China (Zhongguo) to describe non-Han areas, however some Han scholar-officials opposed the Qing Manchu Emperor's use of Zhongguo to refer to non-Han areas, using Zhongguo to mark a distinction between the culturally Han Chinese areas and the territory newly brought into the Manchu Qing empire. In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China. Chinese names for China, aside from Zhongguo, include Zhonghua (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), Huaxia (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), Shenzhou (\u795e\u5dde) and Jiuzhou (\u4e5d\u5dde). Han (\u6f22/\u6c49) and Tang (\u5510) are common names given for the Chinese ethnicity. The People's Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) and Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) are the official names for the two contemporary sovereign states currently claiming sovereignty over the traditional area of China. \"Mainland China\" is used to refer to areas under the jurisdiction by the PRC usually excluding Hong Kong and Macau.\n\ndoc41603: Names of China. The term \"China\" can also be used to refer to:\n\ndoc41567: Names of China. Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc1713758: Made in China. Made in China or Product of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u5236\u9020; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u88fd\u9020; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u00ecz\u00e0o,) is a country of origin label affixed to products manufactured in the People's Republic of China.\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc41577: Names of China. Qing official Zhang Deyi objected to the western European name \"China\" and said that China referred to itself as Zhonghua in response to a European who asked why Chinese used the term guizi to refer to all Europeans.[32]\n\ndoc41619: Names of China. Japanese: Morokoshi (\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057; variously written in kanji as \u5510 or \u5510\u571f). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a kun reading of the Chinese compound \u8af8\u8d8a Zh\u016byu\u00e8 or \u767e\u8d8a B\u01ceiyu\u00e8 as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\ndoc940968: Chinese characters.

Upon maturity, it was common for educated males to acquire a courtesy name (\u5b57, z\u00ec or \u8868\u5b57, bi\u01ceoz\u00ec) either from one's parents, a teacher, or self-selection.

The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41596: Names of China. The name New China has been frequently applied to China by the Communist Party of China as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state. This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the Cold War as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\" to distinguish it from the Republic of China which is commonly called \"Taiwan\", \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\". In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, \"China\" is often used to refer to mainland China to the exclusion of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. In reporting by Western news services, \"China\" typically refers to the People's Republic of China including Hong Kong and Macau,[citation needed] particularly when reporting politics.\n\ndoc2354286: Guangzhou. Gu\u01cengzh\u014du is the pinyin romanisation of the Chinese name \u5ee3\u5dde, which was simplified in mainland China to \u5e7f\u5dde in the 1950s. The name of the city is taken from the ancient Guang Province (Guang Zhou), after it had become the prefecture's seat of government, which is how some other Chinese cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou and Fuzhou got their names. The character \u5ee3 or \u5e7f\u2014which also appears in the names of the provinces Guangdong and Guangxi, together called the Liangguang\u2014means \"broad\" or \"expansive\" and refers to the intention to dispense imperial grace broadly in the region with the founding of county of Guangxin in Han Dynasty.\n\ndoc2252912: Huang (surname). Huang (/\u02c8hw\u0251\u02d0\u014b/;[1] simplified Chinese: \u9ec4; traditional Chinese: \u9ec3) is a Chinese surname that means \"Yellow\". While Hu\u00e1ng is the pinyin romanization of the word, it may also be romanised as Hwang, Huong, Houang, Hoang, Wong, Waan, Wan, Waon, Hwong, Vong, Hung, Hong, Bong, Eng, Ng, Uy, Wee, Oi, Oei, Oey, Ooi, Oof, Ong, or Ung due to pronunciations of the word in different dialects and languages.\n\ndoc41597: Names of China.

Tianzhu was also referred to as Wutianzhu (\u4e94\u5929\u7afa, literally \"Five Indias\"), because there were five geographical regions in India known to the Chinese: Central, Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern India. The monk Xuanzang also referred to India as Wu Yin or \"Five Inds\".[5]\n\ndoc416493: Shanghai. Shanghai is officially abbreviated \u6caa (H\u00f9/Wu) in Chinese,[24] a contraction of \u6caa\u6e0e (H\u00f9 D\u00fa/Vu Doh, lit \"Harpoon Ditch\"),[25][26] a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean.[25] This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.\n\ndoc1317375: Talk:Chinese name. Hello fellow Wikipedians,\n\ndoc41604: Names of China. In economic contexts, \"Greater China\" (\u5927\u4e2d\u83ef\u5730\u5340/\u5927\u4e2d\u534e\u5730\u533a, d\u00e0 Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 d\u00ecq\u016b) is intended to be a neutral and non-political way to refer to Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.\n\ndoc2354289: Guangzhou. The English name \"Canton\" derived from Portuguese Cant\ucc3eo[27] or Cidade de Cant\ucc3eo,[28] a muddling of dialectical pronunciations of \"Guangdong\"[29][30] (e.g., Hakka K\ucc98ng-t\uccadng). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was also used in English in reference to Guangdong generally.[31] It was adopted as the Postal Map Romanization of Guangzhou and remained in common use until the gradual adoption of pinyin. As an adjective, it is still used in describing the people, language, cuisine and culture of Guangzhou and the surrounding Liangguang region. The 19th-century name \"Kwang-chow foo\"[32] derived from Nanjing dialect of Mandarin and the town's status as a prefectural capital.\n\ndoc41599: Names of China. The official name of the Republic of China in various official languages and scripts:\n\ndoc2553911: Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng. The word \u0111\u1ed3ng is from the term \u0111\u1ed3ng ti\u1ec1n (\"money\"), a loanword from the Chinese t\u00f3ng qi\u00e1n (Traditional Chinese: \u9285\u9322; Simplified Chinese: \u94dc\u94b1). The term refers to Chinese bronze coins used as currency during the dynastic periods of China and Vietnam. The term h\u00e0o is a loanword from the Chinese h\u00e1o (Chinese: \u6beb), meaning a tenth of a currency unit. The term xu comes from French sous meaning \"penny\". The sign is encoded U+20AB \u20ab DONG SIGN (HTML\u00a0&#8363;).\n\ndoc1872866: Chinese name. Modern Chinese names consist of a surname known as xing (\u59d3, x\u00ecng), which comes first and is usually but not always monosyllabic, followed by a personal name called ming (\u540d, m\u00edng), which is nearly always mono- or disyllabic.  Prior to the 20th century, educated Chinese also utilized a \"courtesy name\" or \"style name\" called zi (\u5b57, z\u00ec) by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends.\n\ndoc1872868: Chinese name. Although some terms in the ancient Chinese naming system, such as x\u00ecng (\u59d3) and m\u00edng (\u540d), are still used today, they were used in different and more complex ways than in modern China.\n\ndoc470974: Names for India. Tianzhu or Tenjiku (Chinese and Japanese: \u5929\u7afa) (originally pronounced xien-t'juk) is the historical East Asian name for India that comes from the Chinese transliteration of the Persian Hindu, which itself is derived from the Sanskrit Sindhu, the native name of the Indus River.[5] Tianzhu is one of several Chinese transliterations of Sindhu. Shendu (\u8eab\u6bd2) appears in Sima Qian's Shiji and Tiandu (\u5929\u7be4) is used in the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han).[19] Yintejia (\u5370\u7279\u4f3d) comes from the Kuchean Indaka, another transliteration of Hindu.[5] A detailed account of Tianzhu is given in the \"Xiyu Zhuan\" (Record of the Western Regions) in the Hou Hanshu compiled by Fan Ye (398\u2013445):\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc41586: Names of China. This name means Divine Land (\u795e\u5dde; pinyin: Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou. It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\ndoc41587: Names of China. This name, Four Seas (\u56db\u6d77; pinyin: s\u00ech\u01cei), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world. It came from the ancient notion that the world is flat and surrounded by sea.\n\ndoc1155978: Huawei. Huawei is the official translation of the firm's Chinese name (simplified Chinese: \u534e\u4e3a; traditional Chinese: \u83ef\u70ba; pinyin: Hu\u00e1w\u00e9i). The character can also mean \"splendid\" or \"magnificent\", but nowadays mostly refers to \"China\" or \"(ethnic) Chinese\" (see also Names of China). It is common for Chinese companies to use this word, another example being the Taiwanese company Asus (simplified Chinese: \u534e\u7855; traditional Chinese: \u83ef\u78a9; pinyin: Hu\u00e1shu\u00f2; literally: \"Chinese-Eminent\") that was founded back in 1989. The second character of Huawei's name, \u4e3a, means \"action\" or \"achievement\", thus Huawei literally means \"Chinese achievement\".[26]\n\ndoc68040: Chinese dragon. There are a number of places in China called \"Nine Dragons\", the most famous being Kowloon (in Cantonese) in Hong Kong. The part of the Mekong in Vietnam is known as C\u1eedu Long, with the same meaning.\n\ndoc1111198: Manchuria. Manchuria has also been referred to as Guandong (traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u6771; simplified Chinese: \u5173\u4e1c; pinyin: Gu\u0101nd\u014dng), which literally means \"east of the pass\", and similarly Guanwai (\u95dc\u5916; \u5173\u5916; Gu\u0101nw\u00e0i; \"outside the pass\"), a reference to Shanhai Pass in Qinhuangdao in today's Hebei, at the eastern end of the Great Wall of China. This usage is seen in the expression Chu\u01ceng Gu\u0101nd\u014dng (literally \"Rushing into Guandong\") referring to the mass migration of Han Chinese to Manchuria in the 19th and 20th centuries. The name Guandong later came to be used more narrowly for the area of the Kwantung Leased Territory on the Liaodong Peninsula. It is not to be confused with the southern province of Guangdong.\n\ndoc1454202: Taiwan. The official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u570b), to refer to itself, which derives from zh\u014dng (\"central\" or \"middle\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state, nation-state\"), [e] A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty in reference to its royal demesne[f] and the name was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qingera .[34] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as \"Nationalist China\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\").[36] It was a member of the United Nations representing \"China\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People's Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\"[37] The Republic of China participates in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\" due to diplomatic pressure from the People's Republic of China. For instance, it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984, and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.[38]\n\ndoc1471491: Languages of China.

In his Daoyi Zhil\u00fce (1349), Wang Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of it near to Penghu.[31] Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name Ry\u016bky\u016b is the Japanese form of Li\u00faqi\u00fa. The name also appears in the Book of Sui (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.[32]\n\ndoc2144141: List of rulers of China. \u6e56\u5357\u7bc0\u5ea6\u4f7f\n\ndoc2144142: List of rulers of China. \u6e56\u5357\u7bc0\u5ea6\u4f7f\n\ndoc416494: Shanghai. Another alternative name for Shanghai is Sh\u0113n (\u7533) or Sh\u0113nch\u00e9ng (\u7533\u57ce, \"Shen City\"), from Lord Chunshen, a third-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the state of Chu, whose fief included modern Shanghai.[25] Sports teams and newspapers in Shanghai often use Shen in their names, such as Shanghai Shenhua F.C. and Shen Bao.\n\ndoc1712456: Mainland China.

The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc41600: Names of China. Names used in the rest of Asia, especially East and Southeast Asia, are usually derived directly from words in a language of China. Those languages belonging to a former dependency (tributary) or Chinese-influenced country have an especially similar pronunciation to that of Chinese. Those used in Indo-European languages, however, have indirect names that came via other routes and bear little resemblance to what is used in China.\n\ndoc2175382: Chiang Kai-shek. In 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name Chiang Kai-shek (Chinese: \u8523\u4ecb\u77f3; Pinyin: \u00a0Jiang Jieshi\u00a0(help\u00b7info); Wade-Giles: Chiang Chieh-shih) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded: Voice of the Army (Chinese: \u8ecd\u8072). Jieshi is the Pinyin romanization of this name, based on Mandarin, but the most recognized romanized rendering is Kai-shek which is in Cantonese romanization. As the republicans were based in Canton (a Cantonese speaking area, now commonly known as Guangdong province), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in Wade-Giles.\n\ndoc1872890: Chinese name. a. only for Royalty and Emperors; b. only for Royalty and Emperors' reigns.\n\ndoc2480789: Demographics of China.

Dulimbai Gurun is the Manchu name for China (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Middle Kingdom\").[6][7][8] After conquering the Ming, the Manchu Qing identified their state as \"China\" (Zhongguo), and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu. The Manchu Qing Emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including both \"China proper\" and present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas in \"China proper\", proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba, Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing.[9]\n\ndoc210809: Varieties of Chinese.

In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang moved his capital from Shangjing to Yanjing and the city was renamed Zhongdu (\u4e2d\u90fd) or the \"Central Capital\".[30] For the first time in its history, the city of Beijing became a political capital of a major dynasty.\n\ndoc41598: Names of China. Since its founding in 1912, the Republic of China, or ROC, has sometimes been referred to as \"Republican China\" or \"Republican Era\" (\u6c11\u570b\u6642\u4ee3), in contrast to the empire it replaced, or as \"Nationalist China\", after the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). \u4e2d\u83ef (Zhonghua) is a term that pertains to \"China\" while \u6c11\u570b (m\u00edngu\u00f3), literally \"people's country\", stands for \"republic\".[39][40] With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the Chinese Civil War, the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of Taiwan and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"Taiwan\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See Taiwan Independence.) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War, the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" (\u532a\u5340) by the ROC). In addition, the ROC, due to pressure from the PRC, was forced to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u53f0\u5317) whenever it participates in international forums or most sporting events such as the Olympic Games.\n\ndoc41591: Names of China. The name Tang (\u5510; pinyin: T\u00e1ng) comes from the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age. It was during the Tang Dynasty that South China was finally and fully Sinicized; Tang would become synonymous with China in Southern China and it is usually Southern Chinese who refer to themselves as \"Tang ren\" (\u5510\u4eba, pinyin: T\u00e1ngr\u00e9n; literally: \"People of Tang\").[35] For example, the sinicization and rapid development of Guangdong during the Tang period would lead the Cantonese to refer to themselves as Tong-yan (\u5510\u4eba) in Cantonese, while China is called Tong-saan (\u5510\u5c71; pinyin: T\u00e1ngsh\u0101n; literally: \"Tang Mountain\").[36] Chinatowns worldwide, often dominated by Southern Chinese, also became referred to Tong-yan-gaai (\u5510\u4eba\u8857; pinyin: T\u00e1ngr\u00e9nji\u0113; literally: \"Tang people street\"). The Cantonese term is recorded as Tongsan in Old Malay as one of the local terms for China, along with the Sanskrit-derived Cina. It is still used in Malaysia today, usually in a derogatory sense.\n\ndoc2491345: Chinese nobility. The Yan of Langye \u7405\u90aa\u984f\u6c0f spawned Yan Zhitui.\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc761400: Confucianism. R\u00faji\u00e0o and K\u01d2ngji\u00e0o contain the Chinese character ji\u00e0o, the noun \"teaching\" or \"transmission,\" used in such terms as \"education,\" or \"educator.\" The term, however, is notably used to construct the names of religions in Chinese: the terms for Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and other religions in Chinese all end with ji\u00e0o.\n\ndoc41594: Names of China. D\u00e0l\u00f9 (\u5927\u9678/\u5927\u9646; pinyin: d\u00e0l\u00f9), literally \"big continent\" or \"mainland\" in this context, is used as a short form of Zh\u014dngg\u00fao D\u00e0l\u00f9 (\u4e2d\u570b\u5927\u9678/\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646, Mainland China), excluding (depending on the context) Hong Kong and Macau, and/or Taiwan. This term is used in official context in both the mainland and Taiwan, when referring to the mainland as opposed to Taiwan. In certain contexts, it is equivalent to the term Neidi (\u5185\u5730; pinyin: n\u00e8id\u00ec, literally \"the inner land\"). While Neidi generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\ndoc428937: Shang dynasty. The name Y\u012bn (\u6bb7) is used by Sima Qian for the dynasty, and in the \"current text\" version of the Bamboo Annals for both the dynasty and its final capital. It has been a popular name for the Shang throughout history. Since the Records of Emperors and Kings by Huangfu Mi (3rd century AD), it has often been used specifically to describe the later half of the Shang dynasty. In Japan and Korea, the Shang are still referred to almost exclusively as the Yin (In) dynasty. However it seems to have been a Zhou name for the earlier dynasty. The word does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as Sh\u0101ng (\u5546), and the capital as D\u00e0y\u00ec Sh\u0101ng (\u5927\u9091\u5546 \"Great Settlement Shang\").[5] It also does not appear in securely-dated Western Zhou bronze inscriptions.[6]\n\ndoc1317352: Talk:Chinese name. I understand also that many chinese do NOT have middle name, but this is NOT always the case.\n\ndoc68052: Chinese dragon. Non-Imperial Chinese dragon in Shanghai\n\ndoc1471488: Languages of China. (Possibly the ancient N\u00e1nm\u00e1n \u5357\u86ee, \u5357\u883b)\n\ndoc41617: Names of China. Japanese: Kara (\u304b\u3089; variously written in kanji as \u5510 or \u6f22). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as Korea, and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a metonymic extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of Gaya.\n\ndoc1408140: Qin dynasty. Huang-Lao\n\ndoc41601: Names of China. English, most Indo-European languages, and many others use various forms of the name \"China\" and the prefix \"Sino-\" or \"Sin-\" from the Latin Sina.[41][42] Europeans had knowledge of a country known as Thina or Sina from the early period;[43] the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea from perhaps the first century AD recorded a country known as Thin (\u03b8\u03af\u03bd).[44] The English name for \"China\" itself is derived from Middle Persian (Ch\u012bn\u012b \u0686\u06cc\u0646). This modern word \"China\" was first used by Europeans starting with Portuguese explorers of the 16th century \u2013 it was first recorded in 1516 in the journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[45][46] The journal was translated and published in England in 1555.[47]\n\ndoc247739: Chinese culture. In modern China, there are 56 officially labelled ethnic groups in China.[12] Throughout history, many groups have merged into neighboring ethnicities or disappeared. At the same time, many within the Han identity have maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions. The term Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\uff0c\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u65cf) has been used to describe the notion of Chinese nationalism in general. Much of the traditional identity within the community has to do with distinguishing the family name.\n\ndoc41585: Names of China. The name Jiuzhou (\u4e5d\u5dde; pinyin: ji\u01d4 zh\u014du) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of Warring States period of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE). During that time, the Yellow River river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, Yu the Great, who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult Zhou for more information.)\n\ndoc1471486: Languages of China. (Possibly the ancient B\u01ceiyu\u00e8 \u767e\u8d8a)\n\ndoc2058823: Peking opera. Jing (\u51c0): refer to painted-face role, know popularly as Hualian, divided into Zhengjing (\u6b63\u51c0), Fujing (\u526f\u51c0), Wujing (\u6b66\u51c0), Maojing (\u6bdb\u51c0)\n\ndoc862443: Tao. The tao/dao \"the way\" English word of Chinese origin has three meanings, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\ndoc2211621: Spratly Islands dispute. Vietnam's response to China's claim is that Chinese records on Qianli Changsha and Wanli Shitang are in fact records about non-Chinese territories.[60] For example, Qianli Changsha and Wanli Shitang were referred to in the ancient Chinese texts Ling Wai Dai Da[61] and Zhu Fan Zhi[62] as being in the Sea of Jiaozhi, Jiaozhi being the old name for a Chinese province in modern-day northern Vietnam, or as writings on foreign countries.\n\ndoc2089441: Mandarin Chinese. but not as Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0.[11]\n\ndoc229927: Yangtze. The English name Yangtze derives from the Chinese name Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng (\u00a0listen), which refers to the lowest 435 km of the river between Nanjing and Shanghai. The whole river is known in China as Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng (\u00a0listen; literally: \"Long River\").\n\ndoc2114593: Mongolian language. The Yuan dynasty referred to the Mongolian language in Chinese as \"Guoyu\" (Chinese: \u570b\u8a9e), which means \"National language\", a term also used by other non-Han dynasties to refer to their languages such as the Manchu language during the Qing dynasty, the Jurchen language during the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), the Khitan language during the Liao dynasty, and the Xianbei language during the Northern Wei.\n\ndoc2345375: Chin (disambiguation). Chin may also refer to:\n\ndoc1375163: South China Morning Post. From its founding, during the Qing dynasty (Ching dynasty) until 1913, one year after the establishment of the Republic of China, it was known, in Chinese, as \u300a\u5357\u6e05\u65e9\u5831\u300b (Naamcing Zoubou, lit. South Qing Morning Post). In 1913, its Chinese name was changed to \u300a\u5357\u83ef\u65e9\u5831\u300b (lit. South China Morning Post), and has remained as such since then. The Chinese name of Sunday Morning Post is \u300a\u661f\u671f\u65e5\u5357\u83ef\u65e9\u5831\u300b (Singkeijat Naamwaa Zoubou lit. Sunday South China Morning Post).\n\ndoc1791994: Ethnic minorities in China. By definition, these ethnic minority groups, together with the Han majority, make up the greater Chinese nationality known as Zhonghua Minzu. Chinese minorities alone are referred to as \"Shaoshu Minzu\".\n\ndoc1729648: Vladivostok. In modern-day China, Vladivostok is officially known by the transliteration F\u00fal\u0101d\u00edw\u00f2s\u012btu\u014dk\u00e8 (\u7b26\u62c9\u8fea\u6c83\u65af\u6258\u514b), although the historical Chinese name Haishenwai is still often used in common parlance and outside mainland China to refer to the city.[13][14] According to the provisions of the Chinese government, all maps published in China have to bracket the city's Chinese name.[15]\n\ndoc2528195: Geographical renaming. In the People's Republic of China\n\ndoc1219722: Scarborough Shoal. In 1935, China, as the Republic of China (ROC), regarded the shoal as part of the Zhongsha Islands. That position has since been maintained by both the ROC, which now governs Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China (PRC).[50] In 1947 the shoal was given the name Minzhu Jiao (Chinese: \u6c11\u4e3b\u7901; literally: \"Democracy Reef\"). In 1983 the People's Republic of China renamed it Huangyan Island with Minzhu Jiao reserved as a second name.[51] In 1956 Beijing protested Philippine remarks that the South China Sea islands in close proximity to Philippine territory should belong to the Philippines. China's Declaration on the territorial Sea, promulgated in 1958, says in part,\n\ndoc439812: Christianity in China. Terms for Christianity in Chinese include: \"Protestantism\" (Chinese: \u57fa\u7763\u6559\u65b0\u6559; pinyin: J\u012bd\u016b ji\u00e0o x\u012bn ji\u00e0o; literally: \"Christ religion's new religion\"); \"Catholicism\" (Chinese: \u5929\u4e3b\u6559; pinyin: Ti\u0101nzh\u01d4 ji\u00e0o; literally: \"Heavenly Lord religion\"); and Eastern Orthodox Christians (Chinese: \u6771\u6b63\u6559/\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559; pinyin: D\u014dng zh\u00e8ng ji\u00e0o; literally: \"Eastern Orthodox religion\"). The whole of Orthodox Christianity is named Zh\u00e8ng ji\u00e0o (\u6b63\u6559). Christians in China are referred to as \"Christ followers/believers\" (Chinese: \u57fa\u7763\u5f92; pinyin: J\u012bd\u016b t\u00fa) or \"Christ religion followers/believers\" (Chinese: \u57fa\u7763\u6559\u5f92; pinyin: J\u012bd\u016b ji\u00e0o t\u00fa).\n\ndoc679392: Names of Japan. The modern Shanghainese pronunciation of Japan is Zeppen [z\u0259\u0294p\u0259n].  In modern Japanese, Cipangu is transliterated as \u30c1\u30d1\u30f3\u30b0 which in turn can be transliterated into English as Chipangu, Jipangu, Zipangu, Jipang, or Zipang. Jipangu (\u30b8\u30d1\u30f3\u30b0 (Zipangu)) as an obfuscated name for Japan has recently come into vogue for Japanese films, anime, video games, etc.\n\ndoc2144103: List of rulers of China. Chinese convention: use \"Tang\" + temple name (except for Emperor Shang and Emperor Ai; Emperor Xuanzong (\u5510\u7384\u5b97) is sometimes referred as Emperor Ming of Tang Dynasty (\u5510\u660e\u7687))\n\ndoc1872882: Chinese name. In mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the Hanyu Pinyin system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed,[12] it remains in common use and has become the transcription system of the government of Singapore, the United Nations, and the International Organization for Standardization.[13] After many decades of avoiding its use, Taiwan formally adopted Pinyin as its \"New Phonetic System\" in 2009,[14][15] although it continues to allow its citizens to use other romanizations on official documents such as passports. The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as \"q\", \"x\", and \"z\"; when tones are included, they are noted via tone marks. In Pinyin, \u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771 is written as M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng.\n\ndoc1032073: China proper. When the Qing conquered Dzungaria in 1759, they proclaimed that the new land was absorbed into \"China\" (Dulimbai Gurun) in a Manchu language memorial.[10][11][12] The Qing expounded on their ideology that they were bringing together the \"outer\" non-Han Chinese like the Inner Mongols, Eastern Mongols, Oirat Mongols, and Tibetans together with the \"inner\" Han Chinese, into \"one family\" united in the Qing state, showing that the diverse subjects of the Qing were all part of one family, the Qing used the phrase \"Zhong Wai Yi Jia\" (\u4e2d\u5916\u4e00\u5bb6) or \"Nei Wai Yi Jia\" (\u5167\u5916\u4e00\u5bb6, \"interior and exterior as one family\"), to convey this idea of \"unification\" of the different peoples.[13] A Manchu language version of a treaty with the Russian Empire concerning criminal jurisdiction over bandits called people from the Qing as \"people of the Central Kingdom (Dulimbai Gurun)\" [14]\n\ndoc2009660: Religion in Japan. Most Chinese people in Japan practice the Chinese folk religion (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u95f4\u5b97\u6559 or \u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u95f4\u4fe1\u4ef0; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 m\u00ednji\u0101n z\u014dngji\u00e0o or Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 m\u00ednji\u0101n x\u00ecny\u01ceng; Japanese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u6c11\u4fd7\u5b97\u6559; r\u014dmaji: Ch\u016bgoku no minzoku sh\u016bky\u014d), also known as Shenism (Chinese: \u795e\u6559; pinyin: Sh\u00e9nji\u00e0o; Japanese pronunciation: Shinky\u014d), that is very similar to Japanese Shinto.\n\n"

The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc41605: Names of China. Sinologists usually use \"Chinese\" in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of Zhongguo, to the Han ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the overseas Chinese.\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc1032075: China proper. While the Manchu Qing sought used China (Zhongguo) to describe non-Han areas, however some Han scholar-officials opposed the Qing Manchu Emperor's use of Zhongguo to refer to non-Han areas, using Zhongguo to mark a distinction between the culturally Han Chinese areas and the territory newly brought into the Manchu Qing empire. In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China. Chinese names for China, aside from Zhongguo, include Zhonghua (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), Huaxia (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), Shenzhou (\u795e\u5dde) and Jiuzhou (\u4e5d\u5dde). Han (\u6f22/\u6c49) and Tang (\u5510) are common names given for the Chinese ethnicity. The People's Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) and Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) are the official names for the two contemporary sovereign states currently claiming sovereignty over the traditional area of China. \"Mainland China\" is used to refer to areas under the jurisdiction by the PRC usually excluding Hong Kong and Macau.\n\ndoc41603: Names of China. The term \"China\" can also be used to refer to:\n\ndoc41567: Names of China. Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc1713758: Made in China. Made in China or Product of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u5236\u9020; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u88fd\u9020; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u00ecz\u00e0o,) is a country of origin label affixed to products manufactured in the People's Republic of China.\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc41577: Names of China. Qing official Zhang Deyi objected to the western European name \"China\" and said that China referred to itself as Zhonghua in response to a European who asked why Chinese used the term guizi to refer to all Europeans.[32]\n\ndoc41619: Names of China. Japanese: Morokoshi (\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057; variously written in kanji as \u5510 or \u5510\u571f). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a kun reading of the Chinese compound \u8af8\u8d8a Zh\u016byu\u00e8 or \u767e\u8d8a B\u01ceiyu\u00e8 as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\ndoc940968: Chinese characters.

Upon maturity, it was common for educated males to acquire a courtesy name (\u5b57, z\u00ec or \u8868\u5b57, bi\u01ceoz\u00ec) either from one's parents, a teacher, or self-selection.

The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41596: Names of China. The name New China has been frequently applied to China by the Communist Party of China as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state. This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the Cold War as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\" to distinguish it from the Republic of China which is commonly called \"Taiwan\", \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\". In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, \"China\" is often used to refer to mainland China to the exclusion of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. In reporting by Western news services, \"China\" typically refers to the People's Republic of China including Hong Kong and Macau,[citation needed] particularly when reporting politics.\n\ndoc2354286: Guangzhou. Gu\u01cengzh\u014du is the pinyin romanisation of the Chinese name \u5ee3\u5dde, which was simplified in mainland China to \u5e7f\u5dde in the 1950s. The name of the city is taken from the ancient Guang Province (Guang Zhou), after it had become the prefecture's seat of government, which is how some other Chinese cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou and Fuzhou got their names. The character \u5ee3 or \u5e7f\u2014which also appears in the names of the provinces Guangdong and Guangxi, together called the Liangguang\u2014means \"broad\" or \"expansive\" and refers to the intention to dispense imperial grace broadly in the region with the founding of county of Guangxin in Han Dynasty.\n\ndoc2252912: Huang (surname). Huang (/\u02c8hw\u0251\u02d0\u014b/;[1] simplified Chinese: \u9ec4; traditional Chinese: \u9ec3) is a Chinese surname that means \"Yellow\". While Hu\u00e1ng is the pinyin romanization of the word, it may also be romanised as Hwang, Huong, Houang, Hoang, Wong, Waan, Wan, Waon, Hwong, Vong, Hung, Hong, Bong, Eng, Ng, Uy, Wee, Oi, Oei, Oey, Ooi, Oof, Ong, or Ung due to pronunciations of the word in different dialects and languages.\n\ndoc41597: Names of China.

Tianzhu was also referred to as Wutianzhu (\u4e94\u5929\u7afa, literally \"Five Indias\"), because there were five geographical regions in India known to the Chinese: Central, Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern India. The monk Xuanzang also referred to India as Wu Yin or \"Five Inds\".[5]\n\ndoc416493: Shanghai. Shanghai is officially abbreviated \u6caa (H\u00f9/Wu) in Chinese,[24] a contraction of \u6caa\u6e0e (H\u00f9 D\u00fa/Vu Doh, lit \"Harpoon Ditch\"),[25][26] a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean.[25] This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.\n\ndoc1317375: Talk:Chinese name. Hello fellow Wikipedians,\n\ndoc41604: Names of China. In economic contexts, \"Greater China\" (\u5927\u4e2d\u83ef\u5730\u5340/\u5927\u4e2d\u534e\u5730\u533a, d\u00e0 Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 d\u00ecq\u016b) is intended to be a neutral and non-political way to refer to Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.\n\ndoc2354289: Guangzhou. The English name \"Canton\" derived from Portuguese Cant\ucc3eo[27] or Cidade de Cant\ucc3eo,[28] a muddling of dialectical pronunciations of \"Guangdong\"[29][30] (e.g., Hakka K\ucc98ng-t\uccadng). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was also used in English in reference to Guangdong generally.[31] It was adopted as the Postal Map Romanization of Guangzhou and remained in common use until the gradual adoption of pinyin. As an adjective, it is still used in describing the people, language, cuisine and culture of Guangzhou and the surrounding Liangguang region. The 19th-century name \"Kwang-chow foo\"[32] derived from Nanjing dialect of Mandarin and the town's status as a prefectural capital.\n\ndoc41599: Names of China. The official name of the Republic of China in various official languages and scripts:\n\ndoc2553911: Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng. The word \u0111\u1ed3ng is from the term \u0111\u1ed3ng ti\u1ec1n (\"money\"), a loanword from the Chinese t\u00f3ng qi\u00e1n (Traditional Chinese: \u9285\u9322; Simplified Chinese: \u94dc\u94b1). The term refers to Chinese bronze coins used as currency during the dynastic periods of China and Vietnam. The term h\u00e0o is a loanword from the Chinese h\u00e1o (Chinese: \u6beb), meaning a tenth of a currency unit. The term xu comes from French sous meaning \"penny\". The sign is encoded U+20AB \u20ab DONG SIGN (HTML\u00a0&#8363;).\n\ndoc1872866: Chinese name. Modern Chinese names consist of a surname known as xing (\u59d3, x\u00ecng), which comes first and is usually but not always monosyllabic, followed by a personal name called ming (\u540d, m\u00edng), which is nearly always mono- or disyllabic.  Prior to the 20th century, educated Chinese also utilized a \"courtesy name\" or \"style name\" called zi (\u5b57, z\u00ec) by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends.\n\ndoc1872868: Chinese name. Although some terms in the ancient Chinese naming system, such as x\u00ecng (\u59d3) and m\u00edng (\u540d), are still used today, they were used in different and more complex ways than in modern China.\n\ndoc470974: Names for India. Tianzhu or Tenjiku (Chinese and Japanese: \u5929\u7afa) (originally pronounced xien-t'juk) is the historical East Asian name for India that comes from the Chinese transliteration of the Persian Hindu, which itself is derived from the Sanskrit Sindhu, the native name of the Indus River.[5] Tianzhu is one of several Chinese transliterations of Sindhu. Shendu (\u8eab\u6bd2) appears in Sima Qian's Shiji and Tiandu (\u5929\u7be4) is used in the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han).[19] Yintejia (\u5370\u7279\u4f3d) comes from the Kuchean Indaka, another transliteration of Hindu.[5] A detailed account of Tianzhu is given in the \"Xiyu Zhuan\" (Record of the Western Regions) in the Hou Hanshu compiled by Fan Ye (398\u2013445):\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc41586: Names of China. This name means Divine Land (\u795e\u5dde; pinyin: Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou. It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\ndoc41587: Names of China. This name, Four Seas (\u56db\u6d77; pinyin: s\u00ech\u01cei), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world. It came from the ancient notion that the world is flat and surrounded by sea.\n\ndoc1155978: Huawei. Huawei is the official translation of the firm's Chinese name (simplified Chinese: \u534e\u4e3a; traditional Chinese: \u83ef\u70ba; pinyin: Hu\u00e1w\u00e9i). The character can also mean \"splendid\" or \"magnificent\", but nowadays mostly refers to \"China\" or \"(ethnic) Chinese\" (see also Names of China). It is common for Chinese companies to use this word, another example being the Taiwanese company Asus (simplified Chinese: \u534e\u7855; traditional Chinese: \u83ef\u78a9; pinyin: Hu\u00e1shu\u00f2; literally: \"Chinese-Eminent\") that was founded back in 1989. The second character of Huawei's name, \u4e3a, means \"action\" or \"achievement\", thus Huawei literally means \"Chinese achievement\".[26]\n\ndoc68040: Chinese dragon. There are a number of places in China called \"Nine Dragons\", the most famous being Kowloon (in Cantonese) in Hong Kong. The part of the Mekong in Vietnam is known as C\u1eedu Long, with the same meaning.\n\ndoc1111198: Manchuria. Manchuria has also been referred to as Guandong (traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u6771; simplified Chinese: \u5173\u4e1c; pinyin: Gu\u0101nd\u014dng), which literally means \"east of the pass\", and similarly Guanwai (\u95dc\u5916; \u5173\u5916; Gu\u0101nw\u00e0i; \"outside the pass\"), a reference to Shanhai Pass in Qinhuangdao in today's Hebei, at the eastern end of the Great Wall of China. This usage is seen in the expression Chu\u01ceng Gu\u0101nd\u014dng (literally \"Rushing into Guandong\") referring to the mass migration of Han Chinese to Manchuria in the 19th and 20th centuries. The name Guandong later came to be used more narrowly for the area of the Kwantung Leased Territory on the Liaodong Peninsula. It is not to be confused with the southern province of Guangdong.\n\ndoc1454202: Taiwan. The official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u570b), to refer to itself, which derives from zh\u014dng (\"central\" or \"middle\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state, nation-state\"), [e] A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty in reference to its royal demesne[f] and the name was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qingera .[34] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as \"Nationalist China\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\").[36] It was a member of the United Nations representing \"China\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People's Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\"[37] The Republic of China participates in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\" due to diplomatic pressure from the People's Republic of China. For instance, it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984, and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.[38]\n\ndoc1471491: Languages of China.

In his Daoyi Zhil\u00fce (1349), Wang Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of it near to Penghu.[31] Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name Ry\u016bky\u016b is the Japanese form of Li\u00faqi\u00fa. The name also appears in the Book of Sui (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.[32]\n\ndoc2144141: List of rulers of China. \u6e56\u5357\u7bc0\u5ea6\u4f7f\n\ndoc2144142: List of rulers of China. \u6e56\u5357\u7bc0\u5ea6\u4f7f\n\ndoc416494: Shanghai. Another alternative name for Shanghai is Sh\u0113n (\u7533) or Sh\u0113nch\u00e9ng (\u7533\u57ce, \"Shen City\"), from Lord Chunshen, a third-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the state of Chu, whose fief included modern Shanghai.[25] Sports teams and newspapers in Shanghai often use Shen in their names, such as Shanghai Shenhua F.C. and Shen Bao.\n\ndoc1712456: Mainland China.

The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc41600: Names of China. Names used in the rest of Asia, especially East and Southeast Asia, are usually derived directly from words in a language of China. Those languages belonging to a former dependency (tributary) or Chinese-influenced country have an especially similar pronunciation to that of Chinese. Those used in Indo-European languages, however, have indirect names that came via other routes and bear little resemblance to what is used in China.\n\ndoc2175382: Chiang Kai-shek. In 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name Chiang Kai-shek (Chinese: \u8523\u4ecb\u77f3; Pinyin: \u00a0Jiang Jieshi\u00a0(help\u00b7info); Wade-Giles: Chiang Chieh-shih) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded: Voice of the Army (Chinese: \u8ecd\u8072). Jieshi is the Pinyin romanization of this name, based on Mandarin, but the most recognized romanized rendering is Kai-shek which is in Cantonese romanization. As the republicans were based in Canton (a Cantonese speaking area, now commonly known as Guangdong province), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in Wade-Giles.\n\ndoc1872890: Chinese name. a. only for Royalty and Emperors; b. only for Royalty and Emperors' reigns.\n\ndoc2480789: Demographics of China.

Dulimbai Gurun is the Manchu name for China (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Middle Kingdom\").[6][7][8] After conquering the Ming, the Manchu Qing identified their state as \"China\" (Zhongguo), and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu. The Manchu Qing Emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including both \"China proper\" and present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas in \"China proper\", proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba, Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing.[9]\n\ndoc210809: Varieties of Chinese.

In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang moved his capital from Shangjing to Yanjing and the city was renamed Zhongdu (\u4e2d\u90fd) or the \"Central Capital\".[30] For the first time in its history, the city of Beijing became a political capital of a major dynasty.\n\ndoc41598: Names of China. Since its founding in 1912, the Republic of China, or ROC, has sometimes been referred to as \"Republican China\" or \"Republican Era\" (\u6c11\u570b\u6642\u4ee3), in contrast to the empire it replaced, or as \"Nationalist China\", after the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). \u4e2d\u83ef (Zhonghua) is a term that pertains to \"China\" while \u6c11\u570b (m\u00edngu\u00f3), literally \"people's country\", stands for \"republic\".[39][40] With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the Chinese Civil War, the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of Taiwan and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"Taiwan\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See Taiwan Independence.) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War, the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" (\u532a\u5340) by the ROC). In addition, the ROC, due to pressure from the PRC, was forced to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u53f0\u5317) whenever it participates in international forums or most sporting events such as the Olympic Games.\n\ndoc41591: Names of China. The name Tang (\u5510; pinyin: T\u00e1ng) comes from the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age. It was during the Tang Dynasty that South China was finally and fully Sinicized; Tang would become synonymous with China in Southern China and it is usually Southern Chinese who refer to themselves as \"Tang ren\" (\u5510\u4eba, pinyin: T\u00e1ngr\u00e9n; literally: \"People of Tang\").[35] For example, the sinicization and rapid development of Guangdong during the Tang period would lead the Cantonese to refer to themselves as Tong-yan (\u5510\u4eba) in Cantonese, while China is called Tong-saan (\u5510\u5c71; pinyin: T\u00e1ngsh\u0101n; literally: \"Tang Mountain\").[36] Chinatowns worldwide, often dominated by Southern Chinese, also became referred to Tong-yan-gaai (\u5510\u4eba\u8857; pinyin: T\u00e1ngr\u00e9nji\u0113; literally: \"Tang people street\"). The Cantonese term is recorded as Tongsan in Old Malay as one of the local terms for China, along with the Sanskrit-derived Cina. It is still used in Malaysia today, usually in a derogatory sense.\n\ndoc2491345: Chinese nobility. The Yan of Langye \u7405\u90aa\u984f\u6c0f spawned Yan Zhitui.\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc761400: Confucianism. R\u00faji\u00e0o and K\u01d2ngji\u00e0o contain the Chinese character ji\u00e0o, the noun \"teaching\" or \"transmission,\" used in such terms as \"education,\" or \"educator.\" The term, however, is notably used to construct the names of religions in Chinese: the terms for Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and other religions in Chinese all end with ji\u00e0o.\n\ndoc41594: Names of China. D\u00e0l\u00f9 (\u5927\u9678/\u5927\u9646; pinyin: d\u00e0l\u00f9), literally \"big continent\" or \"mainland\" in this context, is used as a short form of Zh\u014dngg\u00fao D\u00e0l\u00f9 (\u4e2d\u570b\u5927\u9678/\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646, Mainland China), excluding (depending on the context) Hong Kong and Macau, and/or Taiwan. This term is used in official context in both the mainland and Taiwan, when referring to the mainland as opposed to Taiwan. In certain contexts, it is equivalent to the term Neidi (\u5185\u5730; pinyin: n\u00e8id\u00ec, literally \"the inner land\"). While Neidi generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\ndoc428937: Shang dynasty. The name Y\u012bn (\u6bb7) is used by Sima Qian for the dynasty, and in the \"current text\" version of the Bamboo Annals for both the dynasty and its final capital. It has been a popular name for the Shang throughout history. Since the Records of Emperors and Kings by Huangfu Mi (3rd century AD), it has often been used specifically to describe the later half of the Shang dynasty. In Japan and Korea, the Shang are still referred to almost exclusively as the Yin (In) dynasty. However it seems to have been a Zhou name for the earlier dynasty. The word does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as Sh\u0101ng (\u5546), and the capital as D\u00e0y\u00ec Sh\u0101ng (\u5927\u9091\u5546 \"Great Settlement Shang\").[5] It also does not appear in securely-dated Western Zhou bronze inscriptions.[6]\n\ndoc1317352: Talk:Chinese name. I understand also that many chinese do NOT have middle name, but this is NOT always the case.\n\ndoc68052: Chinese dragon. Non-Imperial Chinese dragon in Shanghai\n\ndoc1471488: Languages of China. (Possibly the ancient N\u00e1nm\u00e1n \u5357\u86ee, \u5357\u883b)\n\ndoc41617: Names of China. Japanese: Kara (\u304b\u3089; variously written in kanji as \u5510 or \u6f22). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as Korea, and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a metonymic extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of Gaya.\n\ndoc1408140: Qin dynasty. Huang-Lao\n\ndoc41601: Names of China. English, most Indo-European languages, and many others use various forms of the name \"China\" and the prefix \"Sino-\" or \"Sin-\" from the Latin Sina.[41][42] Europeans had knowledge of a country known as Thina or Sina from the early period;[43] the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea from perhaps the first century AD recorded a country known as Thin (\u03b8\u03af\u03bd).[44] The English name for \"China\" itself is derived from Middle Persian (Ch\u012bn\u012b \u0686\u06cc\u0646). This modern word \"China\" was first used by Europeans starting with Portuguese explorers of the 16th century \u2013 it was first recorded in 1516 in the journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[45][46] The journal was translated and published in England in 1555.[47]\n\ndoc247739: Chinese culture. In modern China, there are 56 officially labelled ethnic groups in China.[12] Throughout history, many groups have merged into neighboring ethnicities or disappeared. At the same time, many within the Han identity have maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions. The term Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\uff0c\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u65cf) has been used to describe the notion of Chinese nationalism in general. Much of the traditional identity within the community has to do with distinguishing the family name.\n\ndoc41585: Names of China. The name Jiuzhou (\u4e5d\u5dde; pinyin: ji\u01d4 zh\u014du) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of Warring States period of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE). During that time, the Yellow River river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, Yu the Great, who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult Zhou for more information.)\n\ndoc1471486: Languages of China. (Possibly the ancient B\u01ceiyu\u00e8 \u767e\u8d8a)\n\ndoc2058823: Peking opera. Jing (\u51c0): refer to painted-face role, know popularly as Hualian, divided into Zhengjing (\u6b63\u51c0), Fujing (\u526f\u51c0), Wujing (\u6b66\u51c0), Maojing (\u6bdb\u51c0)\n\ndoc862443: Tao. The tao/dao \"the way\" English word of Chinese origin has three meanings, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\ndoc2211621: Spratly Islands dispute. Vietnam's response to China's claim is that Chinese records on Qianli Changsha and Wanli Shitang are in fact records about non-Chinese territories.[60] For example, Qianli Changsha and Wanli Shitang were referred to in the ancient Chinese texts Ling Wai Dai Da[61] and Zhu Fan Zhi[62] as being in the Sea of Jiaozhi, Jiaozhi being the old name for a Chinese province in modern-day northern Vietnam, or as writings on foreign countries.\n\ndoc2089441: Mandarin Chinese. but not as Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0.[11]\n\ndoc229927: Yangtze. The English name Yangtze derives from the Chinese name Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng (\u00a0listen), which refers to the lowest 435 km of the river between Nanjing and Shanghai. The whole river is known in China as Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng (\u00a0listen; literally: \"Long River\").\n\ndoc2114593: Mongolian language. The Yuan dynasty referred to the Mongolian language in Chinese as \"Guoyu\" (Chinese: \u570b\u8a9e), which means \"National language\", a term also used by other non-Han dynasties to refer to their languages such as the Manchu language during the Qing dynasty, the Jurchen language during the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), the Khitan language during the Liao dynasty, and the Xianbei language during the Northern Wei.\n\ndoc2345375: Chin (disambiguation). Chin may also refer to:\n\ndoc1375163: South China Morning Post. From its founding, during the Qing dynasty (Ching dynasty) until 1913, one year after the establishment of the Republic of China, it was known, in Chinese, as \u300a\u5357\u6e05\u65e9\u5831\u300b (Naamcing Zoubou, lit. South Qing Morning Post). In 1913, its Chinese name was changed to \u300a\u5357\u83ef\u65e9\u5831\u300b (lit. South China Morning Post), and has remained as such since then. The Chinese name of Sunday Morning Post is \u300a\u661f\u671f\u65e5\u5357\u83ef\u65e9\u5831\u300b (Singkeijat Naamwaa Zoubou lit. Sunday South China Morning Post).\n\ndoc1791994: Ethnic minorities in China. By definition, these ethnic minority groups, together with the Han majority, make up the greater Chinese nationality known as Zhonghua Minzu. Chinese minorities alone are referred to as \"Shaoshu Minzu\".\n\ndoc1729648: Vladivostok. In modern-day China, Vladivostok is officially known by the transliteration F\u00fal\u0101d\u00edw\u00f2s\u012btu\u014dk\u00e8 (\u7b26\u62c9\u8fea\u6c83\u65af\u6258\u514b), although the historical Chinese name Haishenwai is still often used in common parlance and outside mainland China to refer to the city.[13][14] According to the provisions of the Chinese government, all maps published in China have to bracket the city's Chinese name.[15]\n\ndoc2528195: Geographical renaming. In the People's Republic of China\n\ndoc1219722: Scarborough Shoal. In 1935, China, as the Republic of China (ROC), regarded the shoal as part of the Zhongsha Islands. That position has since been maintained by both the ROC, which now governs Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China (PRC).[50] In 1947 the shoal was given the name Minzhu Jiao (Chinese: \u6c11\u4e3b\u7901; literally: \"Democracy Reef\"). In 1983 the People's Republic of China renamed it Huangyan Island with Minzhu Jiao reserved as a second name.[51] In 1956 Beijing protested Philippine remarks that the South China Sea islands in close proximity to Philippine territory should belong to the Philippines. China's Declaration on the territorial Sea, promulgated in 1958, says in part,\n\ndoc439812: Christianity in China. Terms for Christianity in Chinese include: \"Protestantism\" (Chinese: \u57fa\u7763\u6559\u65b0\u6559; pinyin: J\u012bd\u016b ji\u00e0o x\u012bn ji\u00e0o; literally: \"Christ religion's new religion\"); \"Catholicism\" (Chinese: \u5929\u4e3b\u6559; pinyin: Ti\u0101nzh\u01d4 ji\u00e0o; literally: \"Heavenly Lord religion\"); and Eastern Orthodox Christians (Chinese: \u6771\u6b63\u6559/\u4e1c\u6b63\u6559; pinyin: D\u014dng zh\u00e8ng ji\u00e0o; literally: \"Eastern Orthodox religion\"). The whole of Orthodox Christianity is named Zh\u00e8ng ji\u00e0o (\u6b63\u6559). Christians in China are referred to as \"Christ followers/believers\" (Chinese: \u57fa\u7763\u5f92; pinyin: J\u012bd\u016b t\u00fa) or \"Christ religion followers/believers\" (Chinese: \u57fa\u7763\u6559\u5f92; pinyin: J\u012bd\u016b ji\u00e0o t\u00fa).\n\ndoc679392: Names of Japan. The modern Shanghainese pronunciation of Japan is Zeppen [z\u0259\u0294p\u0259n].  In modern Japanese, Cipangu is transliterated as \u30c1\u30d1\u30f3\u30b0 which in turn can be transliterated into English as Chipangu, Jipangu, Zipangu, Jipang, or Zipang. Jipangu (\u30b8\u30d1\u30f3\u30b0 (Zipangu)) as an obfuscated name for Japan has recently come into vogue for Japanese films, anime, video games, etc.\n\ndoc2144103: List of rulers of China. Chinese convention: use \"Tang\" + temple name (except for Emperor Shang and Emperor Ai; Emperor Xuanzong (\u5510\u7384\u5b97) is sometimes referred as Emperor Ming of Tang Dynasty (\u5510\u660e\u7687))\n\ndoc1872882: Chinese name. In mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the Hanyu Pinyin system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed,[12] it remains in common use and has become the transcription system of the government of Singapore, the United Nations, and the International Organization for Standardization.[13] After many decades of avoiding its use, Taiwan formally adopted Pinyin as its \"New Phonetic System\" in 2009,[14][15] although it continues to allow its citizens to use other romanizations on official documents such as passports. The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as \"q\", \"x\", and \"z\"; when tones are included, they are noted via tone marks. In Pinyin, \u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771 is written as M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng.\n\ndoc1032073: China proper. When the Qing conquered Dzungaria in 1759, they proclaimed that the new land was absorbed into \"China\" (Dulimbai Gurun) in a Manchu language memorial.[10][11][12] The Qing expounded on their ideology that they were bringing together the \"outer\" non-Han Chinese like the Inner Mongols, Eastern Mongols, Oirat Mongols, and Tibetans together with the \"inner\" Han Chinese, into \"one family\" united in the Qing state, showing that the diverse subjects of the Qing were all part of one family, the Qing used the phrase \"Zhong Wai Yi Jia\" (\u4e2d\u5916\u4e00\u5bb6) or \"Nei Wai Yi Jia\" (\u5167\u5916\u4e00\u5bb6, \"interior and exterior as one family\"), to convey this idea of \"unification\" of the different peoples.[13] A Manchu language version of a treaty with the Russian Empire concerning criminal jurisdiction over bandits called people from the Qing as \"people of the Central Kingdom (Dulimbai Gurun)\" [14]\n\ndoc2009660: Religion in Japan. Most Chinese people in Japan practice the Chinese folk religion (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u95f4\u5b97\u6559 or \u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u95f4\u4fe1\u4ef0; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 m\u00ednji\u0101n z\u014dngji\u00e0o or Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 m\u00ednji\u0101n x\u00ecny\u01ceng; Japanese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u6c11\u4fd7\u5b97\u6559; r\u014dmaji: Ch\u016bgoku no minzoku sh\u016bky\u014d), also known as Shenism (Chinese: \u795e\u6559; pinyin: Sh\u00e9nji\u00e0o; Japanese pronunciation: Shinky\u014d), that is very similar to Japanese Shinto.\n\n"
