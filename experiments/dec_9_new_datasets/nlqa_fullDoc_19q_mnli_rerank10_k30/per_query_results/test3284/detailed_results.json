Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: where does the microchip go in a dog\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc112423: Microchip implant (animal). In Israel, microchips in dogs are mandatory.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2593983: Dognapping. Dogs can be fitted with microchip implants that make them identifiable if they are found.[32] This enables a dog to be identified unless the chip has been removed or has degraded, been assimilated or otherwise been deactivated. Similar methods such as DNA sampling or ear-tattooing are used to identify individual animals and to deter dognappers. Other prevention devices include flashing lights on the dog's collar and strong leashes locked to the collar.\n\ndoc112402: Microchip implant (animal). Microchips are also used by kennels, breeders, brokers, trainers, registries, rescue groups, humane societies, clinics, farms, stables, animal clubs and associations, researchers, and pet stores.\n\ndoc112401: Microchip implant (animal). Animal shelters, animal control officers and veterinarians routinely look for microchips to return lost pets quickly to their owners, avoiding expenses for housing, food, medical care, outplacing and euthanasia. Many shelters place chips in all outplaced animals.\n\ndoc112405: Microchip implant (animal). Microchips can be implanted by a veterinarian or at a shelter. After checking that the animal does not already have a chip, the vet or technician injects the chip with a syringe and records the chip's unique ID. No anesthetic is required it is a simple procedure and causes little discomfort: the pain is minimal and short-lived[2]. A test scan ensures correct operation.\n\ndoc112420: Microchip implant (animal). Some countries, such as Japan, require ISO-compliant microchips or a compatible reader on imported dogs and cats.[7]\n\ndoc112414: Microchip implant (animal). In dogs and cats, chips are usually inserted below the skin at the back of the neck between the shoulder blades on the dorsal midline. According to one reference, continental European pets get the implant in the left side of the neck.[3] The chip can often be felt under the skin. Thin layers of connective tissue form around the implant and hold it in place.\n\ndoc112409: Microchip implant (animal). Many veterinarians scan an animal's chip on every visit to verify correct operation. Some use the chip ID as their database index and print it on receipts, test results, vaccination certifications and other records.\n\ndoc112408: Microchip implant (animal). Authorities and shelters examine strays for chips, providing the recovery service with the ID number, description and location so they may notify the owner or contact. If the pet is wearing the collar tag, the finder does not need a chip reader to contact the registry. An owner can also report a missing pet to the recovery service, as vets look for chips in new animals and check with the recovery service to see if it has been reported lost or stolen.\n\ndoc112399: Microchip implant (animal). A microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit placed under the skin of an animal. The chip, about the size of a large grain of rice, uses passive RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology, and is also known as a PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tag.\n\ndoc112422: Microchip implant (animal). In April 2012 Northern Ireland became the first part of the United Kingdom to require microchipping of individually licensed dogs.[10] Dog microchipping became mandatory in England on 6 April 2016.[11]\n\ndoc112418: Microchip implant (animal). Many animal species have been microchipped, including cockatiels and other parrots, horses, llamas, alpacas, goats, sheep, miniature pigs, rabbits, deer, ferrets, penguins, sharks, snakes, lizards, alligators, turtles, toads, frogs, rare fish, chimpanzees, mice, and prairie dogs\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven whales and elephants. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses microchipping in its research of wild bison, black-footed ferrets, grizzly bears, elk, white-tailed deer, giant land tortoises and armadillos.\n\ndoc112403: Microchip implant (animal). Some pet doors can be programmed to be activated by the microchips of specific animals, allowing only certain animals to use the door.[1]\n\ndoc112419: Microchip implant (animal). Microchips are not yet universal, but they are legally required in some jurisdictions such as the state of New South Wales, Australia[5] and the United Kingdom (for dogs, since 6 April 2016[6]).\n\ndoc112400: Microchip implant (animal). Externally attached microchips such as RFID ear tags are commonly used to identify farm and ranch animals, with the exception of horses. Some external microchips can be read with the same scanner used with implanted chips.\n\ndoc112407: Microchip implant (animal). The owner receives a registration certificate with the chip ID and recovery service contact information. The information can also be imprinted on a collar tag worn by the animal. Like an automobile title, the certificate serves as proof of ownership and is transferred with the animal when it is sold or traded; an animal without a certificate could be stolen.\n\ndoc112425: Microchip implant (animal). The United States uses the National Animal Identification System for farm and ranch animals other than dogs and cats. In most species except horses, an external eartag is typically used in lieu of an implant microchip. Eartags with microchips or simply stamped with a visible number can be used. Both use ISO 15 digit microchip numbers with the U.S. country code of 840.\n\ndoc112421: Microchip implant (animal). In New Zealand, all dogs first registered after 1 July 2006 must be microchipped. Farmers protested that farm dogs should be exempt, drawing a parallel to the Dog Tax War of 1898.[8] Farm dogs were exempted from microchipping in an amendment to the legislation passed in June 2006.[9] A National Animal Identification and Tracing scheme in New Zealand is currently being developed for tracking livestock.\n\ndoc531226: Breed-specific legislation. Dogs of these breeds that are kept legal, also have to be microchipped.[100]\n\ndoc112411: Microchip implant (animal). A microchip implant is a passive RFID device. Lacking an internal power source, it remains inert until it is powered by the scanner.\n\ndoc112410: Microchip implant (animal). Some veterinary tests and procedures require positive identification of the animal, and a microchip may be acceptable for this purpose as an alternative to a tattoo.\n\ndoc112415: Microchip implant (animal). Horses are microchipped on the left side of the neck, halfway between the poll and withers and approximately one inch below the midline of the mane, into the nuchal ligament.\n\ndoc112406: Microchip implant (animal). An enrollment form is completed with chip ID, owner contact information, pet name and description, shelter and/or veterinarian contact information, and an alternate emergency contact designated by the pet owner. Some shelters and vets designate themselves as the primary contact to remain informed about possible problems with the animals they place. The form is sent to a registry, who may be the chip manufacturer, distributor or an independent entity such as a pet recovery service. Some countries have a single official national database. For a fee, the registry typically provides 24-hour, toll-free telephone service for the life of the pet. Some veterinarians leave registration to the owner, usually done online, but a chip without current contact information is essentially useless.\n\ndoc112404: Microchip implant (animal). Some countries require microchips in imported animals to match vaccination records. Microchip tagging may also be required for CITES-regulated international trade in certain endangered animals: for example, Asian Arowana are tagged to limit import to captive-bred fish. Also, birds not banded who cross international borders as pets or for trade must be microchipped so that each bird is uniquely identifiable.\n\ndoc112429: Microchip implant (animal). RFID chips are used in animal research, and at least three studies conducted since the 1990s have reported tumors at the site of implantation in laboratory mice and rats.[37] Noted veterinary associations[38] responded with continued support for the procedure as reasonably safe for cats and dogs, pointing to rates of serious complications on the order of one in a million in the U.K., which has a system for tracking such adverse reactions and has chipped over 3.7 million pet dogs. A recent study found no safety concerns for microchipped animals with RFID chips undergoing MRI at one Tesla magnetic field strength.[39] In 2011 a microchip-associated fibrosarcoma was reported found in the neck of a 9-year old, neutered-male cat. Histological examination was consistent with postinjection sarcoma, but all prior vaccinations occurred in the hindlegs.[40]\n\ndoc112413: Microchip implant (animal). These components are encased in biocompatible soda lime or borosilicate glass and hermetically sealed. Barring rare complications, dogs and cats are unaffected by them.\n\ndoc2593964: Dognapping. Historically in the United States, dogs had been stolen and sold on for medical research, but the introduction of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 reduced these occurrences. The profit available to dognappers varies based upon the value of the dog or the amount that its original owners are willing to pay as ransom. Dog organizations recommend the microchipping of dogs in order to facilitate an animal's return to its rightful owners.\n\ndoc112426: Microchip implant (animal). In most countries, pet ID chips adhere to an international standard to promote compatibility between chips and scanners. In the United States, however, three proprietary types of chips compete along with the international standard. Scanners distributed to United States shelters and veterinarians well into 2006 could each read at most three of the four types. Scanners with quad-read capability are now available and are increasingly considered required equipment. Older scanner models will be in use for some time, so United States pet owners must still choose between a chip with good coverage by existing scanners and one compatible with the international standard. The four types include:\n\ndoc112412: Microchip implant (animal). Most implants contain three elements: a 'chip' or integrated circuit; a coil inductor, possibly with a ferrite core; and a capacitor. The chip contains unique identification data and electronic circuits to encode that information. The coil acts as the secondary winding of a transformer, receiving power inductively coupled to it from the scanner. The coil and capacitor together form a resonant LC circuit tuned to the frequency of the scanner's oscillating magnetic field to produce power for the chip. The chip then transmits its data back through the coil to the scanner.\n\ndoc112424: Microchip implant (animal). Australia has a National Livestock Identification System.\n\ndoc112417: Microchip implant (animal). Implanted microchips can distort magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), including those of the spinal cord.[4]\n\ndoc1773998: Surveillance. A human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or RFID transponder encased in silicate glass and implanted in the body of a human being. A subdermal implant typically contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database, such as personal identification, medical history, medications, allergies, and contact information.\n\ndoc1990340: Pet door. Some of the newest models use radio-frequency identification to electronically read a pet's microchip implant. This removes the need for a cat to wear a collar, which could become lost. Other high-end doors use a key with RFID. The key is attached to the pet's collar, and the electric door only opens for the assigned keys.\n\ndoc112416: Microchip implant (animal). Birds are implanted in their breast muscles. Proper restraint is necessary so the operation requires either two people (an avian veterinarian and a veterinary technician) or general anesthesia.\n\ndoc2181395: Tattoo. Tattoos are also placed on animals, though rarely for decorative reasons. Pets, show animals, thoroughbred horses, and livestock are sometimes tattooed with identification and other marks. Tattooing with a 'slap mark' on the shoulder or on the ear is the standard identification method in commercial pig farming. Branding is used for similar reasons and is often performed without anesthesia, but is different from tattooing as no ink or dye is inserted during the process, the mark instead being caused by permanent scarring of the skin.[19] Pet dogs and cats are sometimes tattooed with a serial number (usually in the ear, or on the inner thigh) via which their owners can be identified. However, the use of a microchip has become an increasingly popular choice and since 2016 is a legal requirement for all 8.5 million pet dogs in the UK.[20]\n\ndoc328805: Labrador Retriever. Labradors as a breed are curious and exploratory and love company, following both people and interesting scents for food, attention, and novelty value. In this way, they can often \"vanish\" or otherwise become separated from their owners with little fanfare.[48] As a breed they are highly intelligent and capable of intense single-mindedness and focus if motivated or their interest is caught. Therefore, with the right conditions and stimuli, a bored Labrador could \"turn into an escape artist par excellence\".[15][49] Many dogs are also stolen.[50] Because of their curious nature and ability to \"vanish,\" along with the risk of being stolen, a number of dog clubs and rescue organisations (including the UK's Kennel Club) consider it good practice that Labradors be microchipped, with the owner's name and address also on their collar and tags.[48][51]\n\ndoc1893827: Interpreter (computing). Microcode is a very commonly used technique \"that imposes an interpreter between the hardware and the architectural level of a computer\".[13] As such, the microcode is a layer of hardware-level instructions that implement higher-level machine code instructions or internal state machine sequencing in many digital processing elements. Microcode is used in general-purpose central processing units, as well as in more specialized processors such as microcontrollers, digital signal processors, channel controllers, disk controllers, network interface controllers, network processors, graphics processing units, and in other hardware.\n\ndoc1075021: Radio-frequency identification. Microchip\u00e2\u20ac\u201cinduced tumors have been noted during animal trials.[91][92]\n\ndoc1057151: BIOS. Intel processors have reprogrammable microcode since the P6 microarchitecture.[15][16] The BIOS may contain patches to the processor microcode that fix errors in the initial processor microcode; reprogramming is not persistent, thus loading of microcode updates is performed each time the system is powered up. Without reprogrammable microcode, an expensive processor swap would be required;[17] for example, the Pentium FDIV bug became an expensive fiasco for Intel as it required a product recall because the original Pentium processor's defective microcode could not be reprogrammed.\n\ndoc112428: Microchip implant (animal). (For users requiring Shelter-Grade certainty, this table is not a substitute for testing the scanner with a set of specimen chips. One study[36] cites problems with certain Trovan chips on the Datamars Black Label scanner. In general, the study found none of the tested scanners to read all four standards without some deficiency. The study predates the most recent scanner models, however.)\n\ndoc1273678: Positron emission tomography. PET technology for small animal imaging: A miniature PE tomograph has been constructed that is small enough for a fully conscious and mobile rat to wear on its head while walking around.[21] This RatCAP (Rat Conscious Animal PET) allows animals to be scanned without the confounding effects of anesthesia. PET scanners designed specifically for imaging rodents, often referred to as microPET,  as well as scanners for small primates,  are marketed for academic and pharmaceutical research.\nThe scanners are apparently based on microminiature scintillators and amplified avalanche photodiodes (APDs) through a new system recently invented uses single chip silicon photomultipliers.\n\ndoc1482998: Brain\u2013computer interface. Researchers have built devices to interface with neural cells and entire neural networks in cultures outside animals. As well as furthering research on animal implantable devices, experiments on cultured neural tissue have focused on building problem-solving networks, constructing basic computers and manipulating robotic devices. Research into techniques for stimulating and recording from individual neurons grown on semiconductor chips is sometimes referred to as neuroelectronics or neurochips.[109]\n\ndoc1592772: Military animal. Some dogs also saw use as messengers.\n\ndoc1893828: Interpreter (computing). Microcode typically resides in special high-speed memory and translates machine instructions, state machine data or other input into sequences of detailed circuit-level operations. It separates the machine instructions from the underlying electronics so that instructions can be designed and altered more freely. It also facilitates the building of complex multi-step instructions, while reducing the complexity of computer circuits. Writing microcode is often called microprogramming and the microcode in a particular processor implementation is sometimes called a microprogram.\n\ndoc1623249: Who Goes There?. The crew realizes they must isolate themselves and therefore disable their airplanes and vehicles, while pretending things are normal over their radio transmissions to prevent any rescue attempt from civilization. The researchers try to figure out who may have been replaced by the alien (simply referred to as the Thing), in order to destroy the imitations before they can escape and take over the world. The task is almost impossibly difficult when they realize that the Thing is also telepathic, able to read minds and project thoughts. A sled dog is conditioned by human blood injections (from Copper and Garry) to provide a human-immunity serum test, as in rabbits. The initial test of Connant is inconclusive as they realize that the test animal received both human and alien blood, meaning that either Doctor Copper or expedition Commander Garry is actually an alien. Assistant commander McReady takes over and deduces that all the other animals at the station, save the test dog, have already become imitations; all are killed by electrocution and their corpses burned.\n\ndoc1773999: Surveillance. Several types of microchips have been developed in order to control and monitor certain types of people, such as criminals, political figures and spies,[clarification needed] a \"killer\" tracking chip patent was filed at the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) around May 2009.\n\ndoc69846: Central processing unit. In some CPU designs the instruction decoder is implemented as a hardwired, unchangeable circuit. In others, a microprogram is used to translate instructions into sets of CPU configuration signals that are applied sequentially over multiple clock pulses. In some cases the memory that stores the microprogram is rewritable, making it possible to change the way in which the CPU decodes instructions.\n\ndoc184824: Cryptorchidism. Commonly affected breeds include:[20]\n\ndoc108756: Computer program. Microcode programs control some central processing units and some other hardware. This code moves data between the registers, buses, arithmetic logic units, and other functional units in the CPU. Unlike conventional programs, microcode is not usually written by, or even visible to, the end users of systems, and is usually provided by the manufacturer, and is considered internal to the device.\n\ndoc2268227: Microcontroller. A microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit, or UC for \u00ce\u00bc-controller) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. In modern terminology, it is similar to, but less sophisticated than, a system on a chip or SoC; an SoC may include a microcontroller as one of its components. A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications consisting of various discrete chips.\n\ndoc1621960: Human\u2013animal communication. Bergin trained dogs to obey 20 written commands on flashcards, in Roman or Japanese characters, including \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u00ab to keep them away from an area.[44]\n\ndoc1592779: Military animal. Dogs have been used for detecting mines; they were trained to spot trip wires, as well as mines and other booby traps. They were also employed for sentry duty, and to spot snipers or hidden enemy forces.\n\ndoc664867: Blood test. In February 2011, Canadian researchers at the University of Calgary's Schulich School of Engineering announced a microchip for blood tests. Dubbed a microemulsion, a droplet of blood captured inside a layer of another substance. It can control the exact size and spacing of the droplets. The new test could improve the efficiency, accuracy and speed of laboratory tests while also doing it cheaply.[15] The microchip costs $25, whereas the robotic dispensers currently in use cost around $10,000.[citation needed]\n\ndoc972899: Cyborg. Military organizations' research has recently focused on the utilization of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage. DARPA has announced its interest in developing \"cyborg insects\" to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupal stage. The insect's motion would be controlled from a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas.[56] Similarly, DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks. The shark's unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives.[57]\n\ndoc2269744: Microkernel. Microkernel servers are essentially daemon programs like any others, except that the kernel grants some of them privileges to interact with parts of physical memory that are otherwise off limits to most programs. This allows some servers, particularly device drivers, to interact directly with hardware.\n\ndoc2268288: Microcontroller. The Microchip PIC16C84, introduced in 1993,[30] was the first microcontroller to use EEPROM to store firmware. In the same year, Atmel introduced the first microcontroller using NOR Flash memory to store firmware.[3] Today's microcontrollers almost exclusively use flash memory, with a few models using FRAM, and some ultra-low-cost parts still use OTP or Mask-ROM.\n\ndoc112427: Microchip implant (animal). Numerous references in print state that the incompatibilities between different chip types are a matter of \"frequency\". One may find claims that early ISO adopters in the United States endangered their customers' pets by giving them ISO chips that work at a \"different frequency\" from the local shelter's scanner, or that the United States government considered forcing an incompatible frequency change. These claims were little challenged by manufacturers and distributors of ISO chips, although later evidence suggests the claims were disinformation. In fact, all chips operate at the scanner's frequency. Although ISO chips are optimized for 134.2 kHz, in practice they are readable at 125\u00a0kHz and the \"125 kHz\" chips are readable at 134.2\u00a0kHz. Confirmation comes from government filings that indicate the supposed \"multi-frequency\" scanners now commonly available are really single-frequency scanners operating at 125, 134.2 or 128\u00a0kHz. In particular, the United States HomeAgain scanner didn't change excitation frequency when ISO-read capability was added; it's still a single frequency, 125\u00a0kHz scanner.[22]\n\ndoc2268252: Microcontroller. Typically micro-controller programs must fit in the available on-chip memory, since it would be costly to provide a system with external, expandable memory. Compilers and assemblers are used to convert both high-level and assembly language codes into a compact machine code for storage in the micro-controller's memory. Depending on the device, the program memory may be permanent, read-only memory that can only be programmed at the factory, or it may be field-alterable flash or erasable read-only memory.\n\ndoc1004551: Dog tag. U.S. Marine Corps\n\ndoc1004515: Dog tag. Another two dog tags are kept inside each military boot in order to identify dead soldiers.\n\ndoc972901: Cyborg. The use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which were remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes. DARPA is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas[64]\n\ndoc273898: Animals in space. C. elegans are also part of experiments aboard the International Space Station as well as research using quail eggs.\n\ndoc1004522: Dog tag. The tags contain the following information:\n\ndoc1696203: Detection dog. Detection dogs have been trained to search for many things, both animate and inanimate, including:\n\ndoc967692: Dog meat. there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and pemmican the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.[47]\n\ndoc639402: Dog anatomy. Deep digital flexor: originates on the fibular and inserts on the plantar surface of the distal phalanges. It acts to flex the digits and extend the tarsus. It is innervated by the tibial nerve.\n\ndoc2593966: Dognapping. The first high-profile case of dognapping for monetary ransom occurred in 1948. The editor of House & Garden magazine, Richardson Wright, had a Pekingese puppy taken by a passing motorist who later telephoned to demand from him \"as much money as you can pay\" for the dog's return.[4] By 1952, gangs of dognappers were reported in the media. During this period, research laboratories would purchase \"bootleg\" dogs for experimentation, and patterns of thefts were apparent with specific types of dogs going missing at certain times. This led to the consideration of using dogs obtained from dog wardens instead of destroying those dogs, in order to cut down on the market for dognappers to sell on stolen dogs.[5]\n\ndoc2268276: Microcontroller. Recent microcontrollers are often integrated with on-chip debug circuitry that when accessed by an in-circuit emulator (ICE) via JTAG, allow debugging of the firmware with a debugger. A real-time ICE may allow viewing and/or manipulating of internal states while running. A tracing ICE can record executed program and MCU states before/after a trigger point.\n\ndoc1621956: Human\u2013animal communication. Bonnie Bergin trained dogs to go to specific text on the wall to ask clearly for \"water, treat or pet me.\" Dogs were able to learn English or Japanese text. She says service dogs can learn to find EXIT signs, bathroom gender signs, and report what disease they smell in a urine sample by going to a sign on the wall naming that disease.[44]\n\ndoc842863: Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Starting in 1984, all dogs are examined by veterinarians/nurses before the start of the race, who check teeth, eyes, tonsils, heart, lungs, joints, and genitals; they look for signs of illegal drugs, improperly healed wounds, and pregnancy. All dogs are identified and tracked by microchip implants and collar tags. On the trails, volunteer veterinarians examine each dog's heart, hydration, appetite, attitude, weight, lungs, and joints at all of the checkpoints, and look for signs of foot and shoulder injuries, respiration problems, dehydration, diarrhea, and exhaustion. When mushers race through checkpoints, the dogs do not get physical exams. Mushers are not allowed to administer drugs that mask the signs of injury, including stimulants, muscle relaxants, sedatives, anti-inflammatories, and anabolic steroids. As of 2005[update], the Iditarod claims that no musher has been banned for giving drugs to dogs.[30] However the Iditarod never reveals the results of tests on the dogs.\n\ndoc2593978: Dognapping. Two stolen dogs were found in an operating room at South America's oldest university in 2009. While the university admitted using dogs for education purposes, the Dean of Peru's University of San Marcos denied that they had been paying dognappers to provide dogs to use as specimens for classes.[26]\n\ndoc1404692: Explosive detection. The explosive detection canine was originated at the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. in 1970, by then trainer Charles R. Kirchner.[2]\n\ndoc1246121: Animal communication. \"Half-bred shepherd dog\"\n\ndoc1609742: Read-only memory. In modern PCs, \"ROM\" (or flash) is used to store the basic bootstrapping firmware for the main processor, as well as the various firmware needed to internally control self-contained devices such as graphic cards, hard disks, DVD drives, TFT screens, etc., in the system. Today, many of these \"read-only\" memories \u2013 especially the BIOS \u2013 are often replaced with Flash memory (see below), to permit in-place reprogramming should the need for a firmware upgrade arise. However, simple and mature sub-systems (such as the keyboard or some communication controllers in the integrated circuits on the main board, for example) may employ mask ROM or OTP (one-time programmable).\n\ndoc2268255: Microcontroller. The use of field-programmable devices on a micro controller may allow field update of the firmware or permit late factory revisions to products that have been assembled but not yet shipped. Programmable memory also reduces the lead time required for deployment of a new product.\n\ndoc2268256: Microcontroller. Where hundreds of thousands of identical devices are required, using parts programmed at the time of manufacture can be economical. These \"mask programmed\" parts have the program laid down in the same way as the logic of the chip, at the same time.\n\ndoc2593973: Dognapping. After the introduction of the Animal Welfare Act in 1966, the trade in dognapping simply moved on to other revenue sources. Pet shops were found to be purchasing stolen dogs, and some laboratories were found to be continuing to accept them. Newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times ran articles advising readers on how to prevent their dogs from being stolen.[18]\n\ndoc803340: Animal welfare in the United States. The Act was amended in the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub.L. 99\u00e2\u20ac\u201c198). Under this law, it was not permitted for a single animal to be used in more than one major operative experiment, from which it was also allowed adequate time to recover as guided by a veterinarian with proper training. This amendment directed new minimum standards for the handling, housing, sanitation, feeding and other care practices. Requirements for psychological well-being of dogs and primates were made. The law also requires research facilities to be able to describe painful practices as well as implement practices that minimize pain and stress to the animals. Another requirement made under this law was for each research facility to establish an Institutional Animal Care committee to oversee research proposals and provide oversight of animal experimentation.[19]\n\ndoc1592776: Military animal. In 2006, The Independent ran a story that the \"Pentagon develops brain implants to turn sharks into military spies\".[22][23]\n\ndoc2558241: Dogs Trust. There are currently centres in:\n\ndoc328828: Labrador Retriever. Police, military, rescue and detection dogs\n\ndoc1907690: Heinz 57. Animals, especially dogs which are a mixture of multiple breeds, can be referred to as \"Heinz 57\".[9]\n\ndoc1304459: The Humane Society of the United States. In 1961, HSUS investigator Frank McMahon launched a probe of dog dealers around the country to generate support for a federal law to prevent cruelty to animals destined for use in laboratories. The five-year investigation into the multilayered trade in dogs paid off in February 1966 when Life published a photo-essay of a raid conducted on a Maryland dog dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premises by McMahon and the state police.[32][33] The Life spread sparked outrage, and tens of thousands of Americans wrote to their congressional representatives, demanding action to protect animals and prevent pet theft. That summer the U.S. Congress approved the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act (later renamed the \"Animal Welfare Act of 1966\"), only the second major federal humane law passed since World War II.[34]\n\ndoc2072829: Motherboard. On recent motherboards the BIOS may also patch the central processor microcode if the BIOS detects that the installed CPU is one for which errata have been published.\n\ndoc1696201: Detection dog. A detection dog or sniffer dog is a dog that is trained to use its senses to detect substances such as explosives, illegal drugs, wildlife scat, currency, blood, and contraband electronics such as illicit mobile phones.[1] The sense most used by detection dogs is smell. Hunting dogs that search for game, and search dogs that work to find missing humans are generally not considered detection dogs. There is some overlap, as in the case of cadaver dogs, trained to search for human remains. A police dog is essentially a detection dog that is used as a resource for police in specific scenarios such as conducting drug raids, finding missing criminals, and locating stashed currency.\n\ndoc836671: A View to a Kill. MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Siberia to locate the body of 003 and recover a microchip originating from the Soviet Union. Upon his return, Q analyses the microchip and establishes that it is a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse and made by government contractor Zorin Industries.\n\ndoc521866: Dog behavior. Service dogs are those that are trained to help people with disabilities such as blindness, epilepsy, diabetes and autism. Detection dogs are trained to using their sense of smell to detect substances such as explosives, illegal drugs, wildlife scat, or blood. In science, dogs have helped humans understand about the conditioned reflex. Attack dogs, dogs that have been trained to attack on command, are employed in security, police, and military roles. Service dog programs have been established to help individuals suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and have shown to have positive results [95]\n\ndoc2329139: Embedded system. The program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as firmware, and are stored in read-only memory or flash memory chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.\n\ndoc2558244: Dogs Trust. In 2010 the charity introduced the term 'battery farming of dogs' to associate the practice of Puppy farming in the minds of the public with that of battery farming of chickens, and aims to educate the public as to where they can safely go to buy a \u2018cruelty free dog\u2019.[11]\n\ndoc907054: Animal Welfare Act of 1966. In 1966, Life Magazine published an article documenting the housing conditions at animal dealer facilities.[9] The article, titled \"Concentration Camp for Dogs,\" featured pictures of skeletal dogs and described the neglectful conditions that the investigative journalists and Maryland State Police found at a Maryland dog dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farm. As a result of these articles, the public lobbied Congress to pass a Federal law that would institute animal housing and care standards.\n[5]\n\ndoc978474: Laika. Before leaving for the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Yazdovsky and Gazenko conducted surgery on the dogs, routing the cables from the transmitters to the sensors that would measure breathing, pulse, and blood pressure.[17]\n\ndoc832878: Dog. In China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.[228]\n\ndoc2062697: Nipper. The iconic image of a mixed fox/bull terrier, Nipper, looking into a phonograph became an international symbol of quality and excellence for the Victor Talking Machine Company.[12] Nipper lives on through the brand names; he even appeared in ads on television with his \"son\", a puppy named Chipper who was added to the RCA family in 1991.[13] Real dogs continue to play the roles of Nipper and Chipper, but Chipper has to be replaced much more frequently, since his character is a puppy.\n\ndoc1696202: Detection dog. Frequently, detection dogs are thought to be used for law enforcement purposes; however, they're also used as a valuable research tool for wildlife biologists. In California, detection dogs are trained to discover quagga mussels on boats at public boat ramps because they are a harmful invasive species for the environment. Detection dogs also tend to be employed for the purposes of finding and collecting the feces of a diverse array of species, including caribou,[2] black-footed ferret, killer whale, and Oregon spotted frog. This process is known as wildlife scat detection.\n\ndoc328810: Labrador Retriever. The high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who during a 2001 emergency placed an unconscious human being in the recovery position, retrieved his mobile phone from beneath the car, fetched a blanket and covered him, barked at nearby dwellings for assistance, and then ran to a nearby hotel to obtain help.[58] A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.[59]\n\ndoc1580639: Cropping (animal). While it has been suggested the cropping may interfere with a dog's ability to communicate using ear signals, some also argue that cropping increases a dog's ability to communicate with ear signals. There has been no scientific comparative study of ear communication in cropped and uncropped dogs.[26]\n\ndoc273884: Animals in space. In total in the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union launched missions with passenger slots for at least 57 dogs. The actual number of dogs in space is smaller, because some dogs flew more than once.\n\ndoc1004480: Dog tag. In reality, the notch was used with the Model 70 Addressograph Hand Identification Imprinting Machine (a pistol-type imprinter used primarily by the Medical Department during World War II).[13][14] American dogtags of the 1930s through 1970s were produced using a Graphotype machine, in which characters are debossed into metal plates.  Some tags are still debossed, using earlier equipment, and some are embossed (with raised letters) on computer-controlled equipment.\n\ndoc566754: History of computing hardware. While the earliest microprocessor ICs literally contained only the processor, i.e. the central processing unit, of a computer, their progressive development naturally led to chips containing most or all of the internal electronic parts of a computer. The integrated circuit in the image on the right, for example, an Intel 8742, is an 8-bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at 12\u00c2\u00a0MHz, 128 bytes of RAM, 2048 bytes of EPROM, and I/O in the same chip.\n\ndoc2593984: Dognapping. Prior to modern identification techniques being introduced, it was suggested that dogs should be tattooed with a unique identification mark. Different organisations used different marks; for instance, the National Dog Registry suggested that the owner's social security number should be used, whereas the American Kennel Club stated that the registry number of the dog should be tattooed inside the hind leg near the body; the United Kennel Club suggesting a similar use of their registry numbers.[18]\n\n"

Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: where does the microchip go in a dog\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc112423: Microchip implant (animal). In Israel, microchips in dogs are mandatory.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2593983: Dognapping. Dogs can be fitted with microchip implants that make them identifiable if they are found.[32] This enables a dog to be identified unless the chip has been removed or has degraded, been assimilated or otherwise been deactivated. Similar methods such as DNA sampling or ear-tattooing are used to identify individual animals and to deter dognappers. Other prevention devices include flashing lights on the dog's collar and strong leashes locked to the collar.\n\ndoc112402: Microchip implant (animal). Microchips are also used by kennels, breeders, brokers, trainers, registries, rescue groups, humane societies, clinics, farms, stables, animal clubs and associations, researchers, and pet stores.\n\ndoc112401: Microchip implant (animal). Animal shelters, animal control officers and veterinarians routinely look for microchips to return lost pets quickly to their owners, avoiding expenses for housing, food, medical care, outplacing and euthanasia. Many shelters place chips in all outplaced animals.\n\ndoc112405: Microchip implant (animal). Microchips can be implanted by a veterinarian or at a shelter. After checking that the animal does not already have a chip, the vet or technician injects the chip with a syringe and records the chip's unique ID. No anesthetic is required it is a simple procedure and causes little discomfort: the pain is minimal and short-lived[2]. A test scan ensures correct operation.\n\ndoc112420: Microchip implant (animal). Some countries, such as Japan, require ISO-compliant microchips or a compatible reader on imported dogs and cats.[7]\n\ndoc112414: Microchip implant (animal). In dogs and cats, chips are usually inserted below the skin at the back of the neck between the shoulder blades on the dorsal midline. According to one reference, continental European pets get the implant in the left side of the neck.[3] The chip can often be felt under the skin. Thin layers of connective tissue form around the implant and hold it in place.\n\ndoc112409: Microchip implant (animal). Many veterinarians scan an animal's chip on every visit to verify correct operation. Some use the chip ID as their database index and print it on receipts, test results, vaccination certifications and other records.\n\ndoc112408: Microchip implant (animal). Authorities and shelters examine strays for chips, providing the recovery service with the ID number, description and location so they may notify the owner or contact. If the pet is wearing the collar tag, the finder does not need a chip reader to contact the registry. An owner can also report a missing pet to the recovery service, as vets look for chips in new animals and check with the recovery service to see if it has been reported lost or stolen.\n\ndoc112399: Microchip implant (animal). A microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit placed under the skin of an animal. The chip, about the size of a large grain of rice, uses passive RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology, and is also known as a PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tag.\n\ndoc112422: Microchip implant (animal). In April 2012 Northern Ireland became the first part of the United Kingdom to require microchipping of individually licensed dogs.[10] Dog microchipping became mandatory in England on 6 April 2016.[11]\n\ndoc112418: Microchip implant (animal). Many animal species have been microchipped, including cockatiels and other parrots, horses, llamas, alpacas, goats, sheep, miniature pigs, rabbits, deer, ferrets, penguins, sharks, snakes, lizards, alligators, turtles, toads, frogs, rare fish, chimpanzees, mice, and prairie dogs\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven whales and elephants. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses microchipping in its research of wild bison, black-footed ferrets, grizzly bears, elk, white-tailed deer, giant land tortoises and armadillos.\n\ndoc112403: Microchip implant (animal). Some pet doors can be programmed to be activated by the microchips of specific animals, allowing only certain animals to use the door.[1]\n\ndoc112419: Microchip implant (animal). Microchips are not yet universal, but they are legally required in some jurisdictions such as the state of New South Wales, Australia[5] and the United Kingdom (for dogs, since 6 April 2016[6]).\n\ndoc112400: Microchip implant (animal). Externally attached microchips such as RFID ear tags are commonly used to identify farm and ranch animals, with the exception of horses. Some external microchips can be read with the same scanner used with implanted chips.\n\ndoc112407: Microchip implant (animal). The owner receives a registration certificate with the chip ID and recovery service contact information. The information can also be imprinted on a collar tag worn by the animal. Like an automobile title, the certificate serves as proof of ownership and is transferred with the animal when it is sold or traded; an animal without a certificate could be stolen.\n\ndoc112425: Microchip implant (animal). The United States uses the National Animal Identification System for farm and ranch animals other than dogs and cats. In most species except horses, an external eartag is typically used in lieu of an implant microchip. Eartags with microchips or simply stamped with a visible number can be used. Both use ISO 15 digit microchip numbers with the U.S. country code of 840.\n\ndoc112421: Microchip implant (animal). In New Zealand, all dogs first registered after 1 July 2006 must be microchipped. Farmers protested that farm dogs should be exempt, drawing a parallel to the Dog Tax War of 1898.[8] Farm dogs were exempted from microchipping in an amendment to the legislation passed in June 2006.[9] A National Animal Identification and Tracing scheme in New Zealand is currently being developed for tracking livestock.\n\ndoc531226: Breed-specific legislation. Dogs of these breeds that are kept legal, also have to be microchipped.[100]\n\ndoc112411: Microchip implant (animal). A microchip implant is a passive RFID device. Lacking an internal power source, it remains inert until it is powered by the scanner.\n\ndoc112410: Microchip implant (animal). Some veterinary tests and procedures require positive identification of the animal, and a microchip may be acceptable for this purpose as an alternative to a tattoo.\n\ndoc112415: Microchip implant (animal). Horses are microchipped on the left side of the neck, halfway between the poll and withers and approximately one inch below the midline of the mane, into the nuchal ligament.\n\ndoc112406: Microchip implant (animal). An enrollment form is completed with chip ID, owner contact information, pet name and description, shelter and/or veterinarian contact information, and an alternate emergency contact designated by the pet owner. Some shelters and vets designate themselves as the primary contact to remain informed about possible problems with the animals they place. The form is sent to a registry, who may be the chip manufacturer, distributor or an independent entity such as a pet recovery service. Some countries have a single official national database. For a fee, the registry typically provides 24-hour, toll-free telephone service for the life of the pet. Some veterinarians leave registration to the owner, usually done online, but a chip without current contact information is essentially useless.\n\ndoc112404: Microchip implant (animal). Some countries require microchips in imported animals to match vaccination records. Microchip tagging may also be required for CITES-regulated international trade in certain endangered animals: for example, Asian Arowana are tagged to limit import to captive-bred fish. Also, birds not banded who cross international borders as pets or for trade must be microchipped so that each bird is uniquely identifiable.\n\ndoc112429: Microchip implant (animal). RFID chips are used in animal research, and at least three studies conducted since the 1990s have reported tumors at the site of implantation in laboratory mice and rats.[37] Noted veterinary associations[38] responded with continued support for the procedure as reasonably safe for cats and dogs, pointing to rates of serious complications on the order of one in a million in the U.K., which has a system for tracking such adverse reactions and has chipped over 3.7 million pet dogs. A recent study found no safety concerns for microchipped animals with RFID chips undergoing MRI at one Tesla magnetic field strength.[39] In 2011 a microchip-associated fibrosarcoma was reported found in the neck of a 9-year old, neutered-male cat. Histological examination was consistent with postinjection sarcoma, but all prior vaccinations occurred in the hindlegs.[40]\n\ndoc112413: Microchip implant (animal). These components are encased in biocompatible soda lime or borosilicate glass and hermetically sealed. Barring rare complications, dogs and cats are unaffected by them.\n\ndoc2593964: Dognapping. Historically in the United States, dogs had been stolen and sold on for medical research, but the introduction of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 reduced these occurrences. The profit available to dognappers varies based upon the value of the dog or the amount that its original owners are willing to pay as ransom. Dog organizations recommend the microchipping of dogs in order to facilitate an animal's return to its rightful owners.\n\ndoc112426: Microchip implant (animal). In most countries, pet ID chips adhere to an international standard to promote compatibility between chips and scanners. In the United States, however, three proprietary types of chips compete along with the international standard. Scanners distributed to United States shelters and veterinarians well into 2006 could each read at most three of the four types. Scanners with quad-read capability are now available and are increasingly considered required equipment. Older scanner models will be in use for some time, so United States pet owners must still choose between a chip with good coverage by existing scanners and one compatible with the international standard. The four types include:\n\ndoc112412: Microchip implant (animal). Most implants contain three elements: a 'chip' or integrated circuit; a coil inductor, possibly with a ferrite core; and a capacitor. The chip contains unique identification data and electronic circuits to encode that information. The coil acts as the secondary winding of a transformer, receiving power inductively coupled to it from the scanner. The coil and capacitor together form a resonant LC circuit tuned to the frequency of the scanner's oscillating magnetic field to produce power for the chip. The chip then transmits its data back through the coil to the scanner.\n\ndoc112424: Microchip implant (animal). Australia has a National Livestock Identification System.\n\ndoc112417: Microchip implant (animal). Implanted microchips can distort magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), including those of the spinal cord.[4]\n\ndoc1773998: Surveillance. A human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or RFID transponder encased in silicate glass and implanted in the body of a human being. A subdermal implant typically contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database, such as personal identification, medical history, medications, allergies, and contact information.\n\ndoc1990340: Pet door. Some of the newest models use radio-frequency identification to electronically read a pet's microchip implant. This removes the need for a cat to wear a collar, which could become lost. Other high-end doors use a key with RFID. The key is attached to the pet's collar, and the electric door only opens for the assigned keys.\n\ndoc112416: Microchip implant (animal). Birds are implanted in their breast muscles. Proper restraint is necessary so the operation requires either two people (an avian veterinarian and a veterinary technician) or general anesthesia.\n\ndoc2181395: Tattoo. Tattoos are also placed on animals, though rarely for decorative reasons. Pets, show animals, thoroughbred horses, and livestock are sometimes tattooed with identification and other marks. Tattooing with a 'slap mark' on the shoulder or on the ear is the standard identification method in commercial pig farming. Branding is used for similar reasons and is often performed without anesthesia, but is different from tattooing as no ink or dye is inserted during the process, the mark instead being caused by permanent scarring of the skin.[19] Pet dogs and cats are sometimes tattooed with a serial number (usually in the ear, or on the inner thigh) via which their owners can be identified. However, the use of a microchip has become an increasingly popular choice and since 2016 is a legal requirement for all 8.5 million pet dogs in the UK.[20]\n\ndoc328805: Labrador Retriever. Labradors as a breed are curious and exploratory and love company, following both people and interesting scents for food, attention, and novelty value. In this way, they can often \"vanish\" or otherwise become separated from their owners with little fanfare.[48] As a breed they are highly intelligent and capable of intense single-mindedness and focus if motivated or their interest is caught. Therefore, with the right conditions and stimuli, a bored Labrador could \"turn into an escape artist par excellence\".[15][49] Many dogs are also stolen.[50] Because of their curious nature and ability to \"vanish,\" along with the risk of being stolen, a number of dog clubs and rescue organisations (including the UK's Kennel Club) consider it good practice that Labradors be microchipped, with the owner's name and address also on their collar and tags.[48][51]\n\ndoc1893827: Interpreter (computing). Microcode is a very commonly used technique \"that imposes an interpreter between the hardware and the architectural level of a computer\".[13] As such, the microcode is a layer of hardware-level instructions that implement higher-level machine code instructions or internal state machine sequencing in many digital processing elements. Microcode is used in general-purpose central processing units, as well as in more specialized processors such as microcontrollers, digital signal processors, channel controllers, disk controllers, network interface controllers, network processors, graphics processing units, and in other hardware.\n\ndoc1075021: Radio-frequency identification. Microchip\u00e2\u20ac\u201cinduced tumors have been noted during animal trials.[91][92]\n\ndoc1057151: BIOS. Intel processors have reprogrammable microcode since the P6 microarchitecture.[15][16] The BIOS may contain patches to the processor microcode that fix errors in the initial processor microcode; reprogramming is not persistent, thus loading of microcode updates is performed each time the system is powered up. Without reprogrammable microcode, an expensive processor swap would be required;[17] for example, the Pentium FDIV bug became an expensive fiasco for Intel as it required a product recall because the original Pentium processor's defective microcode could not be reprogrammed.\n\ndoc112428: Microchip implant (animal). (For users requiring Shelter-Grade certainty, this table is not a substitute for testing the scanner with a set of specimen chips. One study[36] cites problems with certain Trovan chips on the Datamars Black Label scanner. In general, the study found none of the tested scanners to read all four standards without some deficiency. The study predates the most recent scanner models, however.)\n\ndoc1273678: Positron emission tomography. PET technology for small animal imaging: A miniature PE tomograph has been constructed that is small enough for a fully conscious and mobile rat to wear on its head while walking around.[21] This RatCAP (Rat Conscious Animal PET) allows animals to be scanned without the confounding effects of anesthesia. PET scanners designed specifically for imaging rodents, often referred to as microPET,  as well as scanners for small primates,  are marketed for academic and pharmaceutical research.\nThe scanners are apparently based on microminiature scintillators and amplified avalanche photodiodes (APDs) through a new system recently invented uses single chip silicon photomultipliers.\n\ndoc1482998: Brain\u2013computer interface. Researchers have built devices to interface with neural cells and entire neural networks in cultures outside animals. As well as furthering research on animal implantable devices, experiments on cultured neural tissue have focused on building problem-solving networks, constructing basic computers and manipulating robotic devices. Research into techniques for stimulating and recording from individual neurons grown on semiconductor chips is sometimes referred to as neuroelectronics or neurochips.[109]\n\ndoc1592772: Military animal. Some dogs also saw use as messengers.\n\ndoc1893828: Interpreter (computing). Microcode typically resides in special high-speed memory and translates machine instructions, state machine data or other input into sequences of detailed circuit-level operations. It separates the machine instructions from the underlying electronics so that instructions can be designed and altered more freely. It also facilitates the building of complex multi-step instructions, while reducing the complexity of computer circuits. Writing microcode is often called microprogramming and the microcode in a particular processor implementation is sometimes called a microprogram.\n\ndoc1623249: Who Goes There?. The crew realizes they must isolate themselves and therefore disable their airplanes and vehicles, while pretending things are normal over their radio transmissions to prevent any rescue attempt from civilization. The researchers try to figure out who may have been replaced by the alien (simply referred to as the Thing), in order to destroy the imitations before they can escape and take over the world. The task is almost impossibly difficult when they realize that the Thing is also telepathic, able to read minds and project thoughts. A sled dog is conditioned by human blood injections (from Copper and Garry) to provide a human-immunity serum test, as in rabbits. The initial test of Connant is inconclusive as they realize that the test animal received both human and alien blood, meaning that either Doctor Copper or expedition Commander Garry is actually an alien. Assistant commander McReady takes over and deduces that all the other animals at the station, save the test dog, have already become imitations; all are killed by electrocution and their corpses burned.\n\ndoc1773999: Surveillance. Several types of microchips have been developed in order to control and monitor certain types of people, such as criminals, political figures and spies,[clarification needed] a \"killer\" tracking chip patent was filed at the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) around May 2009.\n\ndoc69846: Central processing unit. In some CPU designs the instruction decoder is implemented as a hardwired, unchangeable circuit. In others, a microprogram is used to translate instructions into sets of CPU configuration signals that are applied sequentially over multiple clock pulses. In some cases the memory that stores the microprogram is rewritable, making it possible to change the way in which the CPU decodes instructions.\n\ndoc184824: Cryptorchidism. Commonly affected breeds include:[20]\n\ndoc108756: Computer program. Microcode programs control some central processing units and some other hardware. This code moves data between the registers, buses, arithmetic logic units, and other functional units in the CPU. Unlike conventional programs, microcode is not usually written by, or even visible to, the end users of systems, and is usually provided by the manufacturer, and is considered internal to the device.\n\ndoc2268227: Microcontroller. A microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit, or UC for \u00ce\u00bc-controller) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. In modern terminology, it is similar to, but less sophisticated than, a system on a chip or SoC; an SoC may include a microcontroller as one of its components. A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications consisting of various discrete chips.\n\ndoc1621960: Human\u2013animal communication. Bergin trained dogs to obey 20 written commands on flashcards, in Roman or Japanese characters, including \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u00ab to keep them away from an area.[44]\n\ndoc1592779: Military animal. Dogs have been used for detecting mines; they were trained to spot trip wires, as well as mines and other booby traps. They were also employed for sentry duty, and to spot snipers or hidden enemy forces.\n\ndoc664867: Blood test. In February 2011, Canadian researchers at the University of Calgary's Schulich School of Engineering announced a microchip for blood tests. Dubbed a microemulsion, a droplet of blood captured inside a layer of another substance. It can control the exact size and spacing of the droplets. The new test could improve the efficiency, accuracy and speed of laboratory tests while also doing it cheaply.[15] The microchip costs $25, whereas the robotic dispensers currently in use cost around $10,000.[citation needed]\n\ndoc972899: Cyborg. Military organizations' research has recently focused on the utilization of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage. DARPA has announced its interest in developing \"cyborg insects\" to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupal stage. The insect's motion would be controlled from a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas.[56] Similarly, DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks. The shark's unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives.[57]\n\ndoc2269744: Microkernel. Microkernel servers are essentially daemon programs like any others, except that the kernel grants some of them privileges to interact with parts of physical memory that are otherwise off limits to most programs. This allows some servers, particularly device drivers, to interact directly with hardware.\n\ndoc2268288: Microcontroller. The Microchip PIC16C84, introduced in 1993,[30] was the first microcontroller to use EEPROM to store firmware. In the same year, Atmel introduced the first microcontroller using NOR Flash memory to store firmware.[3] Today's microcontrollers almost exclusively use flash memory, with a few models using FRAM, and some ultra-low-cost parts still use OTP or Mask-ROM.\n\ndoc112427: Microchip implant (animal). Numerous references in print state that the incompatibilities between different chip types are a matter of \"frequency\". One may find claims that early ISO adopters in the United States endangered their customers' pets by giving them ISO chips that work at a \"different frequency\" from the local shelter's scanner, or that the United States government considered forcing an incompatible frequency change. These claims were little challenged by manufacturers and distributors of ISO chips, although later evidence suggests the claims were disinformation. In fact, all chips operate at the scanner's frequency. Although ISO chips are optimized for 134.2 kHz, in practice they are readable at 125\u00a0kHz and the \"125 kHz\" chips are readable at 134.2\u00a0kHz. Confirmation comes from government filings that indicate the supposed \"multi-frequency\" scanners now commonly available are really single-frequency scanners operating at 125, 134.2 or 128\u00a0kHz. In particular, the United States HomeAgain scanner didn't change excitation frequency when ISO-read capability was added; it's still a single frequency, 125\u00a0kHz scanner.[22]\n\ndoc2268252: Microcontroller. Typically micro-controller programs must fit in the available on-chip memory, since it would be costly to provide a system with external, expandable memory. Compilers and assemblers are used to convert both high-level and assembly language codes into a compact machine code for storage in the micro-controller's memory. Depending on the device, the program memory may be permanent, read-only memory that can only be programmed at the factory, or it may be field-alterable flash or erasable read-only memory.\n\ndoc1004551: Dog tag. U.S. Marine Corps\n\ndoc1004515: Dog tag. Another two dog tags are kept inside each military boot in order to identify dead soldiers.\n\ndoc972901: Cyborg. The use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which were remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes. DARPA is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas[64]\n\ndoc273898: Animals in space. C. elegans are also part of experiments aboard the International Space Station as well as research using quail eggs.\n\ndoc1004522: Dog tag. The tags contain the following information:\n\ndoc1696203: Detection dog. Detection dogs have been trained to search for many things, both animate and inanimate, including:\n\ndoc967692: Dog meat. there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and pemmican the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.[47]\n\ndoc639402: Dog anatomy. Deep digital flexor: originates on the fibular and inserts on the plantar surface of the distal phalanges. It acts to flex the digits and extend the tarsus. It is innervated by the tibial nerve.\n\ndoc2593966: Dognapping. The first high-profile case of dognapping for monetary ransom occurred in 1948. The editor of House & Garden magazine, Richardson Wright, had a Pekingese puppy taken by a passing motorist who later telephoned to demand from him \"as much money as you can pay\" for the dog's return.[4] By 1952, gangs of dognappers were reported in the media. During this period, research laboratories would purchase \"bootleg\" dogs for experimentation, and patterns of thefts were apparent with specific types of dogs going missing at certain times. This led to the consideration of using dogs obtained from dog wardens instead of destroying those dogs, in order to cut down on the market for dognappers to sell on stolen dogs.[5]\n\ndoc2268276: Microcontroller. Recent microcontrollers are often integrated with on-chip debug circuitry that when accessed by an in-circuit emulator (ICE) via JTAG, allow debugging of the firmware with a debugger. A real-time ICE may allow viewing and/or manipulating of internal states while running. A tracing ICE can record executed program and MCU states before/after a trigger point.\n\ndoc1621956: Human\u2013animal communication. Bonnie Bergin trained dogs to go to specific text on the wall to ask clearly for \"water, treat or pet me.\" Dogs were able to learn English or Japanese text. She says service dogs can learn to find EXIT signs, bathroom gender signs, and report what disease they smell in a urine sample by going to a sign on the wall naming that disease.[44]\n\ndoc842863: Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Starting in 1984, all dogs are examined by veterinarians/nurses before the start of the race, who check teeth, eyes, tonsils, heart, lungs, joints, and genitals; they look for signs of illegal drugs, improperly healed wounds, and pregnancy. All dogs are identified and tracked by microchip implants and collar tags. On the trails, volunteer veterinarians examine each dog's heart, hydration, appetite, attitude, weight, lungs, and joints at all of the checkpoints, and look for signs of foot and shoulder injuries, respiration problems, dehydration, diarrhea, and exhaustion. When mushers race through checkpoints, the dogs do not get physical exams. Mushers are not allowed to administer drugs that mask the signs of injury, including stimulants, muscle relaxants, sedatives, anti-inflammatories, and anabolic steroids. As of 2005[update], the Iditarod claims that no musher has been banned for giving drugs to dogs.[30] However the Iditarod never reveals the results of tests on the dogs.\n\ndoc2593978: Dognapping. Two stolen dogs were found in an operating room at South America's oldest university in 2009. While the university admitted using dogs for education purposes, the Dean of Peru's University of San Marcos denied that they had been paying dognappers to provide dogs to use as specimens for classes.[26]\n\ndoc1404692: Explosive detection. The explosive detection canine was originated at the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. in 1970, by then trainer Charles R. Kirchner.[2]\n\ndoc1246121: Animal communication. \"Half-bred shepherd dog\"\n\ndoc1609742: Read-only memory. In modern PCs, \"ROM\" (or flash) is used to store the basic bootstrapping firmware for the main processor, as well as the various firmware needed to internally control self-contained devices such as graphic cards, hard disks, DVD drives, TFT screens, etc., in the system. Today, many of these \"read-only\" memories \u2013 especially the BIOS \u2013 are often replaced with Flash memory (see below), to permit in-place reprogramming should the need for a firmware upgrade arise. However, simple and mature sub-systems (such as the keyboard or some communication controllers in the integrated circuits on the main board, for example) may employ mask ROM or OTP (one-time programmable).\n\ndoc2268255: Microcontroller. The use of field-programmable devices on a micro controller may allow field update of the firmware or permit late factory revisions to products that have been assembled but not yet shipped. Programmable memory also reduces the lead time required for deployment of a new product.\n\ndoc2268256: Microcontroller. Where hundreds of thousands of identical devices are required, using parts programmed at the time of manufacture can be economical. These \"mask programmed\" parts have the program laid down in the same way as the logic of the chip, at the same time.\n\ndoc2593973: Dognapping. After the introduction of the Animal Welfare Act in 1966, the trade in dognapping simply moved on to other revenue sources. Pet shops were found to be purchasing stolen dogs, and some laboratories were found to be continuing to accept them. Newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times ran articles advising readers on how to prevent their dogs from being stolen.[18]\n\ndoc803340: Animal welfare in the United States. The Act was amended in the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub.L. 99\u00e2\u20ac\u201c198). Under this law, it was not permitted for a single animal to be used in more than one major operative experiment, from which it was also allowed adequate time to recover as guided by a veterinarian with proper training. This amendment directed new minimum standards for the handling, housing, sanitation, feeding and other care practices. Requirements for psychological well-being of dogs and primates were made. The law also requires research facilities to be able to describe painful practices as well as implement practices that minimize pain and stress to the animals. Another requirement made under this law was for each research facility to establish an Institutional Animal Care committee to oversee research proposals and provide oversight of animal experimentation.[19]\n\ndoc1592776: Military animal. In 2006, The Independent ran a story that the \"Pentagon develops brain implants to turn sharks into military spies\".[22][23]\n\ndoc2558241: Dogs Trust. There are currently centres in:\n\ndoc328828: Labrador Retriever. Police, military, rescue and detection dogs\n\ndoc1907690: Heinz 57. Animals, especially dogs which are a mixture of multiple breeds, can be referred to as \"Heinz 57\".[9]\n\ndoc1304459: The Humane Society of the United States. In 1961, HSUS investigator Frank McMahon launched a probe of dog dealers around the country to generate support for a federal law to prevent cruelty to animals destined for use in laboratories. The five-year investigation into the multilayered trade in dogs paid off in February 1966 when Life published a photo-essay of a raid conducted on a Maryland dog dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premises by McMahon and the state police.[32][33] The Life spread sparked outrage, and tens of thousands of Americans wrote to their congressional representatives, demanding action to protect animals and prevent pet theft. That summer the U.S. Congress approved the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act (later renamed the \"Animal Welfare Act of 1966\"), only the second major federal humane law passed since World War II.[34]\n\ndoc2072829: Motherboard. On recent motherboards the BIOS may also patch the central processor microcode if the BIOS detects that the installed CPU is one for which errata have been published.\n\ndoc1696201: Detection dog. A detection dog or sniffer dog is a dog that is trained to use its senses to detect substances such as explosives, illegal drugs, wildlife scat, currency, blood, and contraband electronics such as illicit mobile phones.[1] The sense most used by detection dogs is smell. Hunting dogs that search for game, and search dogs that work to find missing humans are generally not considered detection dogs. There is some overlap, as in the case of cadaver dogs, trained to search for human remains. A police dog is essentially a detection dog that is used as a resource for police in specific scenarios such as conducting drug raids, finding missing criminals, and locating stashed currency.\n\ndoc836671: A View to a Kill. MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Siberia to locate the body of 003 and recover a microchip originating from the Soviet Union. Upon his return, Q analyses the microchip and establishes that it is a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse and made by government contractor Zorin Industries.\n\ndoc521866: Dog behavior. Service dogs are those that are trained to help people with disabilities such as blindness, epilepsy, diabetes and autism. Detection dogs are trained to using their sense of smell to detect substances such as explosives, illegal drugs, wildlife scat, or blood. In science, dogs have helped humans understand about the conditioned reflex. Attack dogs, dogs that have been trained to attack on command, are employed in security, police, and military roles. Service dog programs have been established to help individuals suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and have shown to have positive results [95]\n\ndoc2329139: Embedded system. The program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as firmware, and are stored in read-only memory or flash memory chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.\n\ndoc2558244: Dogs Trust. In 2010 the charity introduced the term 'battery farming of dogs' to associate the practice of Puppy farming in the minds of the public with that of battery farming of chickens, and aims to educate the public as to where they can safely go to buy a \u2018cruelty free dog\u2019.[11]\n\ndoc907054: Animal Welfare Act of 1966. In 1966, Life Magazine published an article documenting the housing conditions at animal dealer facilities.[9] The article, titled \"Concentration Camp for Dogs,\" featured pictures of skeletal dogs and described the neglectful conditions that the investigative journalists and Maryland State Police found at a Maryland dog dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farm. As a result of these articles, the public lobbied Congress to pass a Federal law that would institute animal housing and care standards.\n[5]\n\ndoc978474: Laika. Before leaving for the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Yazdovsky and Gazenko conducted surgery on the dogs, routing the cables from the transmitters to the sensors that would measure breathing, pulse, and blood pressure.[17]\n\ndoc832878: Dog. In China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.[228]\n\ndoc2062697: Nipper. The iconic image of a mixed fox/bull terrier, Nipper, looking into a phonograph became an international symbol of quality and excellence for the Victor Talking Machine Company.[12] Nipper lives on through the brand names; he even appeared in ads on television with his \"son\", a puppy named Chipper who was added to the RCA family in 1991.[13] Real dogs continue to play the roles of Nipper and Chipper, but Chipper has to be replaced much more frequently, since his character is a puppy.\n\ndoc1696202: Detection dog. Frequently, detection dogs are thought to be used for law enforcement purposes; however, they're also used as a valuable research tool for wildlife biologists. In California, detection dogs are trained to discover quagga mussels on boats at public boat ramps because they are a harmful invasive species for the environment. Detection dogs also tend to be employed for the purposes of finding and collecting the feces of a diverse array of species, including caribou,[2] black-footed ferret, killer whale, and Oregon spotted frog. This process is known as wildlife scat detection.\n\ndoc328810: Labrador Retriever. The high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who during a 2001 emergency placed an unconscious human being in the recovery position, retrieved his mobile phone from beneath the car, fetched a blanket and covered him, barked at nearby dwellings for assistance, and then ran to a nearby hotel to obtain help.[58] A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.[59]\n\ndoc1580639: Cropping (animal). While it has been suggested the cropping may interfere with a dog's ability to communicate using ear signals, some also argue that cropping increases a dog's ability to communicate with ear signals. There has been no scientific comparative study of ear communication in cropped and uncropped dogs.[26]\n\ndoc273884: Animals in space. In total in the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union launched missions with passenger slots for at least 57 dogs. The actual number of dogs in space is smaller, because some dogs flew more than once.\n\ndoc1004480: Dog tag. In reality, the notch was used with the Model 70 Addressograph Hand Identification Imprinting Machine (a pistol-type imprinter used primarily by the Medical Department during World War II).[13][14] American dogtags of the 1930s through 1970s were produced using a Graphotype machine, in which characters are debossed into metal plates.  Some tags are still debossed, using earlier equipment, and some are embossed (with raised letters) on computer-controlled equipment.\n\ndoc566754: History of computing hardware. While the earliest microprocessor ICs literally contained only the processor, i.e. the central processing unit, of a computer, their progressive development naturally led to chips containing most or all of the internal electronic parts of a computer. The integrated circuit in the image on the right, for example, an Intel 8742, is an 8-bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at 12\u00c2\u00a0MHz, 128 bytes of RAM, 2048 bytes of EPROM, and I/O in the same chip.\n\ndoc2593984: Dognapping. Prior to modern identification techniques being introduced, it was suggested that dogs should be tattooed with a unique identification mark. Different organisations used different marks; for instance, the National Dog Registry suggested that the owner's social security number should be used, whereas the American Kennel Club stated that the registry number of the dog should be tattooed inside the hind leg near the body; the United Kennel Club suggesting a similar use of their registry numbers.[18]\n\n"

Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: where does the microchip go in a dog\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc112423: Microchip implant (animal). In Israel, microchips in dogs are mandatory.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2593983: Dognapping. Dogs can be fitted with microchip implants that make them identifiable if they are found.[32] This enables a dog to be identified unless the chip has been removed or has degraded, been assimilated or otherwise been deactivated. Similar methods such as DNA sampling or ear-tattooing are used to identify individual animals and to deter dognappers. Other prevention devices include flashing lights on the dog's collar and strong leashes locked to the collar.\n\ndoc112402: Microchip implant (animal). Microchips are also used by kennels, breeders, brokers, trainers, registries, rescue groups, humane societies, clinics, farms, stables, animal clubs and associations, researchers, and pet stores.\n\ndoc112401: Microchip implant (animal). Animal shelters, animal control officers and veterinarians routinely look for microchips to return lost pets quickly to their owners, avoiding expenses for housing, food, medical care, outplacing and euthanasia. Many shelters place chips in all outplaced animals.\n\ndoc112405: Microchip implant (animal). Microchips can be implanted by a veterinarian or at a shelter. After checking that the animal does not already have a chip, the vet or technician injects the chip with a syringe and records the chip's unique ID. No anesthetic is required it is a simple procedure and causes little discomfort: the pain is minimal and short-lived[2]. A test scan ensures correct operation.\n\ndoc112420: Microchip implant (animal). Some countries, such as Japan, require ISO-compliant microchips or a compatible reader on imported dogs and cats.[7]\n\ndoc112414: Microchip implant (animal). In dogs and cats, chips are usually inserted below the skin at the back of the neck between the shoulder blades on the dorsal midline. According to one reference, continental European pets get the implant in the left side of the neck.[3] The chip can often be felt under the skin. Thin layers of connective tissue form around the implant and hold it in place.\n\ndoc112409: Microchip implant (animal). Many veterinarians scan an animal's chip on every visit to verify correct operation. Some use the chip ID as their database index and print it on receipts, test results, vaccination certifications and other records.\n\ndoc112408: Microchip implant (animal). Authorities and shelters examine strays for chips, providing the recovery service with the ID number, description and location so they may notify the owner or contact. If the pet is wearing the collar tag, the finder does not need a chip reader to contact the registry. An owner can also report a missing pet to the recovery service, as vets look for chips in new animals and check with the recovery service to see if it has been reported lost or stolen.\n\ndoc112399: Microchip implant (animal). A microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit placed under the skin of an animal. The chip, about the size of a large grain of rice, uses passive RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology, and is also known as a PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tag.\n\ndoc112422: Microchip implant (animal). In April 2012 Northern Ireland became the first part of the United Kingdom to require microchipping of individually licensed dogs.[10] Dog microchipping became mandatory in England on 6 April 2016.[11]\n\ndoc112418: Microchip implant (animal). Many animal species have been microchipped, including cockatiels and other parrots, horses, llamas, alpacas, goats, sheep, miniature pigs, rabbits, deer, ferrets, penguins, sharks, snakes, lizards, alligators, turtles, toads, frogs, rare fish, chimpanzees, mice, and prairie dogs\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven whales and elephants. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses microchipping in its research of wild bison, black-footed ferrets, grizzly bears, elk, white-tailed deer, giant land tortoises and armadillos.\n\ndoc112403: Microchip implant (animal). Some pet doors can be programmed to be activated by the microchips of specific animals, allowing only certain animals to use the door.[1]\n\ndoc112419: Microchip implant (animal). Microchips are not yet universal, but they are legally required in some jurisdictions such as the state of New South Wales, Australia[5] and the United Kingdom (for dogs, since 6 April 2016[6]).\n\ndoc112400: Microchip implant (animal). Externally attached microchips such as RFID ear tags are commonly used to identify farm and ranch animals, with the exception of horses. Some external microchips can be read with the same scanner used with implanted chips.\n\ndoc112407: Microchip implant (animal). The owner receives a registration certificate with the chip ID and recovery service contact information. The information can also be imprinted on a collar tag worn by the animal. Like an automobile title, the certificate serves as proof of ownership and is transferred with the animal when it is sold or traded; an animal without a certificate could be stolen.\n\ndoc112425: Microchip implant (animal). The United States uses the National Animal Identification System for farm and ranch animals other than dogs and cats. In most species except horses, an external eartag is typically used in lieu of an implant microchip. Eartags with microchips or simply stamped with a visible number can be used. Both use ISO 15 digit microchip numbers with the U.S. country code of 840.\n\ndoc112421: Microchip implant (animal). In New Zealand, all dogs first registered after 1 July 2006 must be microchipped. Farmers protested that farm dogs should be exempt, drawing a parallel to the Dog Tax War of 1898.[8] Farm dogs were exempted from microchipping in an amendment to the legislation passed in June 2006.[9] A National Animal Identification and Tracing scheme in New Zealand is currently being developed for tracking livestock.\n\ndoc531226: Breed-specific legislation. Dogs of these breeds that are kept legal, also have to be microchipped.[100]\n\ndoc112411: Microchip implant (animal). A microchip implant is a passive RFID device. Lacking an internal power source, it remains inert until it is powered by the scanner.\n\ndoc112410: Microchip implant (animal). Some veterinary tests and procedures require positive identification of the animal, and a microchip may be acceptable for this purpose as an alternative to a tattoo.\n\ndoc112415: Microchip implant (animal). Horses are microchipped on the left side of the neck, halfway between the poll and withers and approximately one inch below the midline of the mane, into the nuchal ligament.\n\ndoc112406: Microchip implant (animal). An enrollment form is completed with chip ID, owner contact information, pet name and description, shelter and/or veterinarian contact information, and an alternate emergency contact designated by the pet owner. Some shelters and vets designate themselves as the primary contact to remain informed about possible problems with the animals they place. The form is sent to a registry, who may be the chip manufacturer, distributor or an independent entity such as a pet recovery service. Some countries have a single official national database. For a fee, the registry typically provides 24-hour, toll-free telephone service for the life of the pet. Some veterinarians leave registration to the owner, usually done online, but a chip without current contact information is essentially useless.\n\ndoc112404: Microchip implant (animal). Some countries require microchips in imported animals to match vaccination records. Microchip tagging may also be required for CITES-regulated international trade in certain endangered animals: for example, Asian Arowana are tagged to limit import to captive-bred fish. Also, birds not banded who cross international borders as pets or for trade must be microchipped so that each bird is uniquely identifiable.\n\ndoc112429: Microchip implant (animal). RFID chips are used in animal research, and at least three studies conducted since the 1990s have reported tumors at the site of implantation in laboratory mice and rats.[37] Noted veterinary associations[38] responded with continued support for the procedure as reasonably safe for cats and dogs, pointing to rates of serious complications on the order of one in a million in the U.K., which has a system for tracking such adverse reactions and has chipped over 3.7 million pet dogs. A recent study found no safety concerns for microchipped animals with RFID chips undergoing MRI at one Tesla magnetic field strength.[39] In 2011 a microchip-associated fibrosarcoma was reported found in the neck of a 9-year old, neutered-male cat. Histological examination was consistent with postinjection sarcoma, but all prior vaccinations occurred in the hindlegs.[40]\n\ndoc112413: Microchip implant (animal). These components are encased in biocompatible soda lime or borosilicate glass and hermetically sealed. Barring rare complications, dogs and cats are unaffected by them.\n\ndoc2593964: Dognapping. Historically in the United States, dogs had been stolen and sold on for medical research, but the introduction of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 reduced these occurrences. The profit available to dognappers varies based upon the value of the dog or the amount that its original owners are willing to pay as ransom. Dog organizations recommend the microchipping of dogs in order to facilitate an animal's return to its rightful owners.\n\ndoc112426: Microchip implant (animal). In most countries, pet ID chips adhere to an international standard to promote compatibility between chips and scanners. In the United States, however, three proprietary types of chips compete along with the international standard. Scanners distributed to United States shelters and veterinarians well into 2006 could each read at most three of the four types. Scanners with quad-read capability are now available and are increasingly considered required equipment. Older scanner models will be in use for some time, so United States pet owners must still choose between a chip with good coverage by existing scanners and one compatible with the international standard. The four types include:\n\ndoc112412: Microchip implant (animal). Most implants contain three elements: a 'chip' or integrated circuit; a coil inductor, possibly with a ferrite core; and a capacitor. The chip contains unique identification data and electronic circuits to encode that information. The coil acts as the secondary winding of a transformer, receiving power inductively coupled to it from the scanner. The coil and capacitor together form a resonant LC circuit tuned to the frequency of the scanner's oscillating magnetic field to produce power for the chip. The chip then transmits its data back through the coil to the scanner.\n\ndoc112424: Microchip implant (animal). Australia has a National Livestock Identification System.\n\ndoc112417: Microchip implant (animal). Implanted microchips can distort magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), including those of the spinal cord.[4]\n\ndoc1773998: Surveillance. A human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or RFID transponder encased in silicate glass and implanted in the body of a human being. A subdermal implant typically contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database, such as personal identification, medical history, medications, allergies, and contact information.\n\ndoc1990340: Pet door. Some of the newest models use radio-frequency identification to electronically read a pet's microchip implant. This removes the need for a cat to wear a collar, which could become lost. Other high-end doors use a key with RFID. The key is attached to the pet's collar, and the electric door only opens for the assigned keys.\n\ndoc112416: Microchip implant (animal). Birds are implanted in their breast muscles. Proper restraint is necessary so the operation requires either two people (an avian veterinarian and a veterinary technician) or general anesthesia.\n\ndoc2181395: Tattoo. Tattoos are also placed on animals, though rarely for decorative reasons. Pets, show animals, thoroughbred horses, and livestock are sometimes tattooed with identification and other marks. Tattooing with a 'slap mark' on the shoulder or on the ear is the standard identification method in commercial pig farming. Branding is used for similar reasons and is often performed without anesthesia, but is different from tattooing as no ink or dye is inserted during the process, the mark instead being caused by permanent scarring of the skin.[19] Pet dogs and cats are sometimes tattooed with a serial number (usually in the ear, or on the inner thigh) via which their owners can be identified. However, the use of a microchip has become an increasingly popular choice and since 2016 is a legal requirement for all 8.5 million pet dogs in the UK.[20]\n\ndoc328805: Labrador Retriever. Labradors as a breed are curious and exploratory and love company, following both people and interesting scents for food, attention, and novelty value. In this way, they can often \"vanish\" or otherwise become separated from their owners with little fanfare.[48] As a breed they are highly intelligent and capable of intense single-mindedness and focus if motivated or their interest is caught. Therefore, with the right conditions and stimuli, a bored Labrador could \"turn into an escape artist par excellence\".[15][49] Many dogs are also stolen.[50] Because of their curious nature and ability to \"vanish,\" along with the risk of being stolen, a number of dog clubs and rescue organisations (including the UK's Kennel Club) consider it good practice that Labradors be microchipped, with the owner's name and address also on their collar and tags.[48][51]\n\ndoc1893827: Interpreter (computing). Microcode is a very commonly used technique \"that imposes an interpreter between the hardware and the architectural level of a computer\".[13] As such, the microcode is a layer of hardware-level instructions that implement higher-level machine code instructions or internal state machine sequencing in many digital processing elements. Microcode is used in general-purpose central processing units, as well as in more specialized processors such as microcontrollers, digital signal processors, channel controllers, disk controllers, network interface controllers, network processors, graphics processing units, and in other hardware.\n\ndoc1075021: Radio-frequency identification. Microchip\u00e2\u20ac\u201cinduced tumors have been noted during animal trials.[91][92]\n\ndoc1057151: BIOS. Intel processors have reprogrammable microcode since the P6 microarchitecture.[15][16] The BIOS may contain patches to the processor microcode that fix errors in the initial processor microcode; reprogramming is not persistent, thus loading of microcode updates is performed each time the system is powered up. Without reprogrammable microcode, an expensive processor swap would be required;[17] for example, the Pentium FDIV bug became an expensive fiasco for Intel as it required a product recall because the original Pentium processor's defective microcode could not be reprogrammed.\n\ndoc112428: Microchip implant (animal). (For users requiring Shelter-Grade certainty, this table is not a substitute for testing the scanner with a set of specimen chips. One study[36] cites problems with certain Trovan chips on the Datamars Black Label scanner. In general, the study found none of the tested scanners to read all four standards without some deficiency. The study predates the most recent scanner models, however.)\n\ndoc1273678: Positron emission tomography. PET technology for small animal imaging: A miniature PE tomograph has been constructed that is small enough for a fully conscious and mobile rat to wear on its head while walking around.[21] This RatCAP (Rat Conscious Animal PET) allows animals to be scanned without the confounding effects of anesthesia. PET scanners designed specifically for imaging rodents, often referred to as microPET,  as well as scanners for small primates,  are marketed for academic and pharmaceutical research.\nThe scanners are apparently based on microminiature scintillators and amplified avalanche photodiodes (APDs) through a new system recently invented uses single chip silicon photomultipliers.\n\ndoc1482998: Brain\u2013computer interface. Researchers have built devices to interface with neural cells and entire neural networks in cultures outside animals. As well as furthering research on animal implantable devices, experiments on cultured neural tissue have focused on building problem-solving networks, constructing basic computers and manipulating robotic devices. Research into techniques for stimulating and recording from individual neurons grown on semiconductor chips is sometimes referred to as neuroelectronics or neurochips.[109]\n\ndoc1592772: Military animal. Some dogs also saw use as messengers.\n\ndoc1893828: Interpreter (computing). Microcode typically resides in special high-speed memory and translates machine instructions, state machine data or other input into sequences of detailed circuit-level operations. It separates the machine instructions from the underlying electronics so that instructions can be designed and altered more freely. It also facilitates the building of complex multi-step instructions, while reducing the complexity of computer circuits. Writing microcode is often called microprogramming and the microcode in a particular processor implementation is sometimes called a microprogram.\n\ndoc1623249: Who Goes There?. The crew realizes they must isolate themselves and therefore disable their airplanes and vehicles, while pretending things are normal over their radio transmissions to prevent any rescue attempt from civilization. The researchers try to figure out who may have been replaced by the alien (simply referred to as the Thing), in order to destroy the imitations before they can escape and take over the world. The task is almost impossibly difficult when they realize that the Thing is also telepathic, able to read minds and project thoughts. A sled dog is conditioned by human blood injections (from Copper and Garry) to provide a human-immunity serum test, as in rabbits. The initial test of Connant is inconclusive as they realize that the test animal received both human and alien blood, meaning that either Doctor Copper or expedition Commander Garry is actually an alien. Assistant commander McReady takes over and deduces that all the other animals at the station, save the test dog, have already become imitations; all are killed by electrocution and their corpses burned.\n\ndoc1773999: Surveillance. Several types of microchips have been developed in order to control and monitor certain types of people, such as criminals, political figures and spies,[clarification needed] a \"killer\" tracking chip patent was filed at the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) around May 2009.\n\ndoc69846: Central processing unit. In some CPU designs the instruction decoder is implemented as a hardwired, unchangeable circuit. In others, a microprogram is used to translate instructions into sets of CPU configuration signals that are applied sequentially over multiple clock pulses. In some cases the memory that stores the microprogram is rewritable, making it possible to change the way in which the CPU decodes instructions.\n\ndoc184824: Cryptorchidism. Commonly affected breeds include:[20]\n\ndoc108756: Computer program. Microcode programs control some central processing units and some other hardware. This code moves data between the registers, buses, arithmetic logic units, and other functional units in the CPU. Unlike conventional programs, microcode is not usually written by, or even visible to, the end users of systems, and is usually provided by the manufacturer, and is considered internal to the device.\n\ndoc2268227: Microcontroller. A microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit, or UC for \u00ce\u00bc-controller) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. In modern terminology, it is similar to, but less sophisticated than, a system on a chip or SoC; an SoC may include a microcontroller as one of its components. A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications consisting of various discrete chips.\n\ndoc1621960: Human\u2013animal communication. Bergin trained dogs to obey 20 written commands on flashcards, in Roman or Japanese characters, including \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u00ab to keep them away from an area.[44]\n\ndoc1592779: Military animal. Dogs have been used for detecting mines; they were trained to spot trip wires, as well as mines and other booby traps. They were also employed for sentry duty, and to spot snipers or hidden enemy forces.\n\ndoc664867: Blood test. In February 2011, Canadian researchers at the University of Calgary's Schulich School of Engineering announced a microchip for blood tests. Dubbed a microemulsion, a droplet of blood captured inside a layer of another substance. It can control the exact size and spacing of the droplets. The new test could improve the efficiency, accuracy and speed of laboratory tests while also doing it cheaply.[15] The microchip costs $25, whereas the robotic dispensers currently in use cost around $10,000.[citation needed]\n\ndoc972899: Cyborg. Military organizations' research has recently focused on the utilization of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage. DARPA has announced its interest in developing \"cyborg insects\" to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupal stage. The insect's motion would be controlled from a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas.[56] Similarly, DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks. The shark's unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives.[57]\n\ndoc2269744: Microkernel. Microkernel servers are essentially daemon programs like any others, except that the kernel grants some of them privileges to interact with parts of physical memory that are otherwise off limits to most programs. This allows some servers, particularly device drivers, to interact directly with hardware.\n\ndoc2268288: Microcontroller. The Microchip PIC16C84, introduced in 1993,[30] was the first microcontroller to use EEPROM to store firmware. In the same year, Atmel introduced the first microcontroller using NOR Flash memory to store firmware.[3] Today's microcontrollers almost exclusively use flash memory, with a few models using FRAM, and some ultra-low-cost parts still use OTP or Mask-ROM.\n\ndoc112427: Microchip implant (animal). Numerous references in print state that the incompatibilities between different chip types are a matter of \"frequency\". One may find claims that early ISO adopters in the United States endangered their customers' pets by giving them ISO chips that work at a \"different frequency\" from the local shelter's scanner, or that the United States government considered forcing an incompatible frequency change. These claims were little challenged by manufacturers and distributors of ISO chips, although later evidence suggests the claims were disinformation. In fact, all chips operate at the scanner's frequency. Although ISO chips are optimized for 134.2 kHz, in practice they are readable at 125\u00a0kHz and the \"125 kHz\" chips are readable at 134.2\u00a0kHz. Confirmation comes from government filings that indicate the supposed \"multi-frequency\" scanners now commonly available are really single-frequency scanners operating at 125, 134.2 or 128\u00a0kHz. In particular, the United States HomeAgain scanner didn't change excitation frequency when ISO-read capability was added; it's still a single frequency, 125\u00a0kHz scanner.[22]\n\ndoc2268252: Microcontroller. Typically micro-controller programs must fit in the available on-chip memory, since it would be costly to provide a system with external, expandable memory. Compilers and assemblers are used to convert both high-level and assembly language codes into a compact machine code for storage in the micro-controller's memory. Depending on the device, the program memory may be permanent, read-only memory that can only be programmed at the factory, or it may be field-alterable flash or erasable read-only memory.\n\ndoc1004551: Dog tag. U.S. Marine Corps\n\ndoc1004515: Dog tag. Another two dog tags are kept inside each military boot in order to identify dead soldiers.\n\ndoc972901: Cyborg. The use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which were remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes. DARPA is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas[64]\n\ndoc273898: Animals in space. C. elegans are also part of experiments aboard the International Space Station as well as research using quail eggs.\n\ndoc1004522: Dog tag. The tags contain the following information:\n\ndoc1696203: Detection dog. Detection dogs have been trained to search for many things, both animate and inanimate, including:\n\ndoc967692: Dog meat. there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and pemmican the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.[47]\n\ndoc639402: Dog anatomy. Deep digital flexor: originates on the fibular and inserts on the plantar surface of the distal phalanges. It acts to flex the digits and extend the tarsus. It is innervated by the tibial nerve.\n\ndoc2593966: Dognapping. The first high-profile case of dognapping for monetary ransom occurred in 1948. The editor of House & Garden magazine, Richardson Wright, had a Pekingese puppy taken by a passing motorist who later telephoned to demand from him \"as much money as you can pay\" for the dog's return.[4] By 1952, gangs of dognappers were reported in the media. During this period, research laboratories would purchase \"bootleg\" dogs for experimentation, and patterns of thefts were apparent with specific types of dogs going missing at certain times. This led to the consideration of using dogs obtained from dog wardens instead of destroying those dogs, in order to cut down on the market for dognappers to sell on stolen dogs.[5]\n\ndoc2268276: Microcontroller. Recent microcontrollers are often integrated with on-chip debug circuitry that when accessed by an in-circuit emulator (ICE) via JTAG, allow debugging of the firmware with a debugger. A real-time ICE may allow viewing and/or manipulating of internal states while running. A tracing ICE can record executed program and MCU states before/after a trigger point.\n\ndoc1621956: Human\u2013animal communication. Bonnie Bergin trained dogs to go to specific text on the wall to ask clearly for \"water, treat or pet me.\" Dogs were able to learn English or Japanese text. She says service dogs can learn to find EXIT signs, bathroom gender signs, and report what disease they smell in a urine sample by going to a sign on the wall naming that disease.[44]\n\ndoc842863: Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Starting in 1984, all dogs are examined by veterinarians/nurses before the start of the race, who check teeth, eyes, tonsils, heart, lungs, joints, and genitals; they look for signs of illegal drugs, improperly healed wounds, and pregnancy. All dogs are identified and tracked by microchip implants and collar tags. On the trails, volunteer veterinarians examine each dog's heart, hydration, appetite, attitude, weight, lungs, and joints at all of the checkpoints, and look for signs of foot and shoulder injuries, respiration problems, dehydration, diarrhea, and exhaustion. When mushers race through checkpoints, the dogs do not get physical exams. Mushers are not allowed to administer drugs that mask the signs of injury, including stimulants, muscle relaxants, sedatives, anti-inflammatories, and anabolic steroids. As of 2005[update], the Iditarod claims that no musher has been banned for giving drugs to dogs.[30] However the Iditarod never reveals the results of tests on the dogs.\n\ndoc2593978: Dognapping. Two stolen dogs were found in an operating room at South America's oldest university in 2009. While the university admitted using dogs for education purposes, the Dean of Peru's University of San Marcos denied that they had been paying dognappers to provide dogs to use as specimens for classes.[26]\n\ndoc1404692: Explosive detection. The explosive detection canine was originated at the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. in 1970, by then trainer Charles R. Kirchner.[2]\n\ndoc1246121: Animal communication. \"Half-bred shepherd dog\"\n\ndoc1609742: Read-only memory. In modern PCs, \"ROM\" (or flash) is used to store the basic bootstrapping firmware for the main processor, as well as the various firmware needed to internally control self-contained devices such as graphic cards, hard disks, DVD drives, TFT screens, etc., in the system. Today, many of these \"read-only\" memories \u2013 especially the BIOS \u2013 are often replaced with Flash memory (see below), to permit in-place reprogramming should the need for a firmware upgrade arise. However, simple and mature sub-systems (such as the keyboard or some communication controllers in the integrated circuits on the main board, for example) may employ mask ROM or OTP (one-time programmable).\n\ndoc2268255: Microcontroller. The use of field-programmable devices on a micro controller may allow field update of the firmware or permit late factory revisions to products that have been assembled but not yet shipped. Programmable memory also reduces the lead time required for deployment of a new product.\n\ndoc2268256: Microcontroller. Where hundreds of thousands of identical devices are required, using parts programmed at the time of manufacture can be economical. These \"mask programmed\" parts have the program laid down in the same way as the logic of the chip, at the same time.\n\ndoc2593973: Dognapping. After the introduction of the Animal Welfare Act in 1966, the trade in dognapping simply moved on to other revenue sources. Pet shops were found to be purchasing stolen dogs, and some laboratories were found to be continuing to accept them. Newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times ran articles advising readers on how to prevent their dogs from being stolen.[18]\n\ndoc803340: Animal welfare in the United States. The Act was amended in the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub.L. 99\u00e2\u20ac\u201c198). Under this law, it was not permitted for a single animal to be used in more than one major operative experiment, from which it was also allowed adequate time to recover as guided by a veterinarian with proper training. This amendment directed new minimum standards for the handling, housing, sanitation, feeding and other care practices. Requirements for psychological well-being of dogs and primates were made. The law also requires research facilities to be able to describe painful practices as well as implement practices that minimize pain and stress to the animals. Another requirement made under this law was for each research facility to establish an Institutional Animal Care committee to oversee research proposals and provide oversight of animal experimentation.[19]\n\ndoc1592776: Military animal. In 2006, The Independent ran a story that the \"Pentagon develops brain implants to turn sharks into military spies\".[22][23]\n\ndoc2558241: Dogs Trust. There are currently centres in:\n\ndoc328828: Labrador Retriever. Police, military, rescue and detection dogs\n\ndoc1907690: Heinz 57. Animals, especially dogs which are a mixture of multiple breeds, can be referred to as \"Heinz 57\".[9]\n\ndoc1304459: The Humane Society of the United States. In 1961, HSUS investigator Frank McMahon launched a probe of dog dealers around the country to generate support for a federal law to prevent cruelty to animals destined for use in laboratories. The five-year investigation into the multilayered trade in dogs paid off in February 1966 when Life published a photo-essay of a raid conducted on a Maryland dog dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premises by McMahon and the state police.[32][33] The Life spread sparked outrage, and tens of thousands of Americans wrote to their congressional representatives, demanding action to protect animals and prevent pet theft. That summer the U.S. Congress approved the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act (later renamed the \"Animal Welfare Act of 1966\"), only the second major federal humane law passed since World War II.[34]\n\ndoc2072829: Motherboard. On recent motherboards the BIOS may also patch the central processor microcode if the BIOS detects that the installed CPU is one for which errata have been published.\n\ndoc1696201: Detection dog. A detection dog or sniffer dog is a dog that is trained to use its senses to detect substances such as explosives, illegal drugs, wildlife scat, currency, blood, and contraband electronics such as illicit mobile phones.[1] The sense most used by detection dogs is smell. Hunting dogs that search for game, and search dogs that work to find missing humans are generally not considered detection dogs. There is some overlap, as in the case of cadaver dogs, trained to search for human remains. A police dog is essentially a detection dog that is used as a resource for police in specific scenarios such as conducting drug raids, finding missing criminals, and locating stashed currency.\n\ndoc836671: A View to a Kill. MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Siberia to locate the body of 003 and recover a microchip originating from the Soviet Union. Upon his return, Q analyses the microchip and establishes that it is a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse and made by government contractor Zorin Industries.\n\ndoc521866: Dog behavior. Service dogs are those that are trained to help people with disabilities such as blindness, epilepsy, diabetes and autism. Detection dogs are trained to using their sense of smell to detect substances such as explosives, illegal drugs, wildlife scat, or blood. In science, dogs have helped humans understand about the conditioned reflex. Attack dogs, dogs that have been trained to attack on command, are employed in security, police, and military roles. Service dog programs have been established to help individuals suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and have shown to have positive results [95]\n\ndoc2329139: Embedded system. The program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as firmware, and are stored in read-only memory or flash memory chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.\n\ndoc2558244: Dogs Trust. In 2010 the charity introduced the term 'battery farming of dogs' to associate the practice of Puppy farming in the minds of the public with that of battery farming of chickens, and aims to educate the public as to where they can safely go to buy a \u2018cruelty free dog\u2019.[11]\n\ndoc907054: Animal Welfare Act of 1966. In 1966, Life Magazine published an article documenting the housing conditions at animal dealer facilities.[9] The article, titled \"Concentration Camp for Dogs,\" featured pictures of skeletal dogs and described the neglectful conditions that the investigative journalists and Maryland State Police found at a Maryland dog dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farm. As a result of these articles, the public lobbied Congress to pass a Federal law that would institute animal housing and care standards.\n[5]\n\ndoc978474: Laika. Before leaving for the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Yazdovsky and Gazenko conducted surgery on the dogs, routing the cables from the transmitters to the sensors that would measure breathing, pulse, and blood pressure.[17]\n\ndoc832878: Dog. In China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.[228]\n\ndoc2062697: Nipper. The iconic image of a mixed fox/bull terrier, Nipper, looking into a phonograph became an international symbol of quality and excellence for the Victor Talking Machine Company.[12] Nipper lives on through the brand names; he even appeared in ads on television with his \"son\", a puppy named Chipper who was added to the RCA family in 1991.[13] Real dogs continue to play the roles of Nipper and Chipper, but Chipper has to be replaced much more frequently, since his character is a puppy.\n\ndoc1696202: Detection dog. Frequently, detection dogs are thought to be used for law enforcement purposes; however, they're also used as a valuable research tool for wildlife biologists. In California, detection dogs are trained to discover quagga mussels on boats at public boat ramps because they are a harmful invasive species for the environment. Detection dogs also tend to be employed for the purposes of finding and collecting the feces of a diverse array of species, including caribou,[2] black-footed ferret, killer whale, and Oregon spotted frog. This process is known as wildlife scat detection.\n\ndoc328810: Labrador Retriever. The high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who during a 2001 emergency placed an unconscious human being in the recovery position, retrieved his mobile phone from beneath the car, fetched a blanket and covered him, barked at nearby dwellings for assistance, and then ran to a nearby hotel to obtain help.[58] A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.[59]\n\ndoc1580639: Cropping (animal). While it has been suggested the cropping may interfere with a dog's ability to communicate using ear signals, some also argue that cropping increases a dog's ability to communicate with ear signals. There has been no scientific comparative study of ear communication in cropped and uncropped dogs.[26]\n\ndoc273884: Animals in space. In total in the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union launched missions with passenger slots for at least 57 dogs. The actual number of dogs in space is smaller, because some dogs flew more than once.\n\ndoc1004480: Dog tag. In reality, the notch was used with the Model 70 Addressograph Hand Identification Imprinting Machine (a pistol-type imprinter used primarily by the Medical Department during World War II).[13][14] American dogtags of the 1930s through 1970s were produced using a Graphotype machine, in which characters are debossed into metal plates.  Some tags are still debossed, using earlier equipment, and some are embossed (with raised letters) on computer-controlled equipment.\n\ndoc566754: History of computing hardware. While the earliest microprocessor ICs literally contained only the processor, i.e. the central processing unit, of a computer, their progressive development naturally led to chips containing most or all of the internal electronic parts of a computer. The integrated circuit in the image on the right, for example, an Intel 8742, is an 8-bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at 12\u00c2\u00a0MHz, 128 bytes of RAM, 2048 bytes of EPROM, and I/O in the same chip.\n\ndoc2593984: Dognapping. Prior to modern identification techniques being introduced, it was suggested that dogs should be tattooed with a unique identification mark. Different organisations used different marks; for instance, the National Dog Registry suggested that the owner's social security number should be used, whereas the American Kennel Club stated that the registry number of the dog should be tattooed inside the hind leg near the body; the United Kennel Club suggesting a similar use of their registry numbers.[18]\n\n"
