This prayer opens each decade of the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24201: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated three times in succession, concludes the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24193: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer is optional, and may be used to begin the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24203: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer is optional, and may be used after the Holy God to end the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24190: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. According to Roman Catholic tradition, the chaplet may be said at any time, but it is said especially on Divine Mercy Sunday and Fridays at 3:00 PM. The Chaplet is prayed daily at the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In the Philippines, Singapore, and Hong Kong the \"3 o'clock Prayer\" is broadcast on radio and television stations daily at 3:00 p.m. In 2000, Pope John Paul II ordained the Sunday after Easter Divine Mercy Sunday, where Roman Catholics remember the institution of the Sacrament of Penance. The hour Jesus died by crucifixion, 3:00 PM (15:00), is called the Hour of Mercy. In a novena, the chaplet is usually said each of the nine days from Good Friday to Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\ndoc24184: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that she received the prayer through visions and conversations with Jesus, who made specific promises regarding the recitation of the prayers.[2] Her Vatican biography quotes some of these conversations.[4]\n\ndoc24187: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. According to Faustina's visions, written in her diary, the chaplet's prayers for mercy are threefold: to obtain mercy, to trust in Christ's mercy, and to show mercy to others.[6][10][11] Faustina wrote that Jesus promised that all who recite this chaplet at the hour of death or in the presence of the dying will receive great mercy. She wrote that Jesus said:\n\ndoc24195: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated three times in succession, is also optional, and may be used along with the first opening prayer to begin the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24200: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc24199: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated 10 times in succession, forms the body of each decade of the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24192: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\n\ndoc24204: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.[14]\n\ndoc24208: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. To conclude:\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc24207: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24209: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc2397475: Divine Mercy Sunday. The liturgical celebration of Divine Mercy Sunday reflects the devotional elements of Divine Mercy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first prayer of that Mass beginning with:\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc2397479: Divine Mercy Sunday. In June 2002, John Paul II granted indulgences to Catholics who recite specific prayers on that day, which were then formally decreed by the Apostolic Penitentiary.[5] The priests are also ordered in that day to lead the prayers in honor of Divine Mercy, inform the parishioners about the Divine Mercy, and hear confessions.[5]\n\ndoc2397457: Divine Mercy Sunday. The feast of Divine Mercy, as recorded in the diary of Saint Faustyna, receives from Jesus himself the biggest promises of grace related to the Devotion of Divine Mercy. In specific, Jesus said that a person who goes to sacramental confession (the confession may take place some days before) and receives holy communion on that day, shall obtain the total forgiveness of all sins and punishment. That means each person would go immediately after death to heaven without suffering in purgatory (or hell). Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church grants a plenary indulgence (observing the usual rules) with the recitation of some simple prayers.[4][5][6]\n\ndoc24206: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet is begun on the short strand of the rosary beads:\n\ndoc24196: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fountain of Mercy for us, I trust in You![14]\n\ndoc2397480: Divine Mercy Sunday. This Plenary Indulgence is obtained by observing the usual dispositions that are on place for the granting of this grace through the Intercession of the Catholic Church, that is: Sacramental Confession (the confession may take place some days before), Holy Communion, to pray for the intentions of the pope (an Our Father and Hail Mary is minimum requirement), when the faithful detached from any sin, even venial, either:\n\ndoc2397466: Divine Mercy Sunday. Ask of my faithful servant [a priest] that, on this day, he tell the whole world of My great mercy; that whoever approaches the Fountain of Life on this day will be granted complete forgiveness of sins and punishment. Mankind will not have peace until it turns with trust to My mercy.\n\ndoc2397463: Divine Mercy Sunday. This Feast emerged from the very depths of My mercy, and it is confirmed in the vast depths of my tender mercies. Every soul believing and trusting in My mercy will obtain it.\n\ndoc2397482: Divine Mercy Sunday. Additionally, for the faithful who, for a justified reason beyond their control, are unable to go to church or chapel, may obtain forgiveness with the recitation of one Our Father and Creed before a devout image of Jesus adding \"Merciful Jesus, I Trust in you.\" They will receive the plenary Indulgence that day with the condition of fulfilling the usual sacramental requirements at a later time.\n\ndoc2397458: Divine Mercy Sunday. Faustyna Kowalska, a Polish nun reported visions and visitations from Jesus and conversations with Him. He asked her to paint the vision of His Merciful Divinity being poured from His sacred heart and specifically asked for a feast of Divine Mercy to be established on the first Sunday after Easter so mankind would take refuge in Him:[7][8]\n\ndoc2397468: Divine Mercy Sunday. I want to grant a complete pardon to the souls that will go to Confession and receive Holy Communion on the Feast of My Mercy.\n\ndoc2397473: Divine Mercy Sunday. Jesus said to St. Faustyna one day: \"Humanity will never find peace until it turns with trust to Divine Mercy\". Divine Mercy! This is the Easter gift that the Church receives from the risen Christ and offers to humanity.[17]\n\ndoc2397470: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday is also the day after the culmination of the novena of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy.[10][11] Faustyna wrote Jesus instructed her that the Feast of Mercy (the Sunday after Easter) be preceded by a Divine Mercy Novena which would begin on Good Friday.[10]\n\ndoc2397474: Divine Mercy Sunday. The devotion to Divine Mercy Sunday grew rapidly after its designation by Pope John Paul II and is now widely celebrated by Catholics.[18] The Divine Mercy image is often carried in processions on Divine Mercy Sunday, and is placed in a location in the church so that it can be venerated by those who attended the Mass.[18]\n\ndoc2397456: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday (also known as the Feast of the Divine Mercy) is celebrated on the Sunday after Easter, the Octave Day of Easter. The feast day is observed by Roman Catholic as well as some Anglicans.[3] It is originally based on the Catholic devotion to the Divine Mercy that Saint Faustyna Kowalska reported as part of her encounter with Jesus, and is associated with special promises from Jesus and indulgences issued by the Church.\n\ndoc2397477: Divine Mercy Sunday. This opening prayer refers to Divine Mercy as the key element in the plan of God for salvation and emphasizes the belief that it was through mercy that God gave his only son for the redemption of mankind, after the fall of Adam.[19]\n\ndoc2397472: Divine Mercy Sunday. The devotion was actively promoted by Pope John Paul II. On April 30, 2000, the Canonization of Faustyna Kowalska took place and the Sunday after Easter was officially designated as the Sunday of the Divine Mercy (Dominica II Paschae seu de divina misericordia) in the General Roman Calendar.[15][16] On April 22, 2001, which was one year after establishing Divine Mercy Sunday, Pope John Paul II re-emphasized its message in the resurrection context of Easter:\n\ndoc24188: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. \"....When they say this Chaplet in the presence of the dying, I will stand between My Father and the dying not as the just judge but as the Merciful Savior.\"\n\ndoc24198: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Eternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc2397465: Divine Mercy Sunday. In several entries in her diary, Faustyna recorded promises of Grace and Mercy associated to the Feast of Divine Mercy on Mercy Sunday. Jesus Stated:[9]\n\ndoc2397476: Divine Mercy Sunday. Heavenly Father and God of Mercy, We no longer look for Jesus among the dead, for He is alive and has become the Lord of Life.[19]\n\ndoc24211: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The novena intentions for each day are:\n\ndoc2397460: Divine Mercy Sunday. Let all mankind recognize My unfathomable mercy. It is a sign for the end times; after it will come the day of justice.\n\ndoc2397462: Divine Mercy Sunday. Sunday, April 28, 1935. Low Sunday; that is, the Feast of The Divine Mercy, the conclusion of the Jubilee of Redemption. When we went to take part in the celebrations, my heart leapt with joy that the two solemnities were so closely united.\n\ndoc2397467: Divine Mercy Sunday. I desire that the Feast of Mercy be a refuge and shelter for all souls, and especially for poor sinners. On that day, the very depths of My tender mercy are open. I pour out a whole ocean of graces upon those souls who approach the fount of My mercy. The soul that will go to Confession and receive Holy Communion shall obtain the complete forgiveness of sins and punishment. On that day all the divine floodgates through which grace flow are opened. Let no soul fear to draw near to Me, even though its sins be as scarlet.\n\ndoc2397461: Divine Mercy Sunday. Souls perish in spite of My bitter Passion. I am giving them the last hope of salvation; that is, the Feast of My Mercy. If they will not adore My mercy, they will perish for all eternity\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 tell souls about this great mercy of Mine, because the awful day, the day of My justice, is near.\n\ndoc24210: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. These souls cause Me more suffering than any others; it was from such souls that My soul felt the most revulsion in the Garden of Olives. It was on their account that I said: \"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass Me by.\" The last hope of salvation for them is to flee to My Mercy.\"[16]\n\ndoc2397481: Divine Mercy Sunday. ...in both cases, adding a devout prayer to the Merciful Lord (i.e. \"Merciful Jesus, I trust in You.\").\n\ndoc2397464: Divine Mercy Sunday. Yes, the first Sunday after Easter is the Feast of Mercy, but there must also be deeds of mercy, which are to arise out of love for Me. You are to show mercy to our neighbors always and everywhere. You must not shrink from this or try to absolve yourself from it.\n\ndoc24194: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.[14]\n\ndoc1353821: Works of mercy. Pope John Paul II issued a papal encyclical \"Dives in misericordia\" on 30 November 1980 declaring that \"Jesus Christ taught that man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but that he is also called \"to practice mercy\" towards others.[4] Another notable devotion associated with the works of mercy is the Divine Mercy, which are reputed to be apparitions of Jesus Christ to Saint Faustina Kowalska.\n\ndoc2397469: Divine Mercy Sunday. On March 23, 1937, Faustyna wrote in her diary (Notebook III, item 1044) that she had a vision that the feast of Divine Mercy would be celebrated in her local chapel, and would be attended by large crowds, and that the same celebration would be held in Rome attended by the Pope.[4][6] She wrote: \"The crowd was so enormous that the eye could not take it all in. Everyone was participating in the celebrations.\"[4]\n\ndoc1353823: Works of mercy. In particular cases, a given individual will not be obligated or even competent to perform four of the spiritual works of mercy, namely: instructing the ignorant, counseling the doubtful, admonishing sinners, and comforting the afflicted. These works may require a definitely superior level of authority or knowledge or an extraordinary amount of tact. The other works of mercy, however, are considered to be an obligation of all faithful to practise unconditionally.[11] In an address on the 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation, Pope Francis suggested \"care for creation\" as a new work of mercy. Corporally, it means simple daily gestures of peace and love; spiritually, it means contemplation of the world.[12]\n\ndoc1016756: Dua. Once a man said, \"O God, forgive me and have mercy and have mercy on me!\" This was after the man had finished two raka'ats. Prophet Muhammad said, \"You have been hasty, O worshipper! When you finish your prayer, then sit down and praise God with the praise that he is worthy of, and recite durood upon me, then state your du'a...\"[25]\n\ndoc2397471: Divine Mercy Sunday. The first Mass during which the Divine Mercy image was displayed was on April 28, 1935, the first Sunday after Easter (the Feast of Divine Mercy) and was attended by Sr. Faustyna. (Diary of St. Faustyna, item 420).[12] April 28, 1935 was also the celebration of the end of the Jubilee of the Redemption by Pope Pius XI.[12][13] Father Michael Sopocko (Faustyna's confessor) celebrated the Mass that Sunday and obtained permission to place the image within the Gate of Dawn church in Vilnius during the Mass.[12][14]\n\ndoc599181: National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts). Pilgrims began to arrive the very next spring to celebrate the Feast of The Divine Mercy (just after Easter). By the end of World War II in 1945, pilgrims in growing numbers came to offer thanksgiving for graces received through the Divine Mercy message and devotion. They urged the Marians to build a shrine to Jesus, The Divine Mercy, as a votive of thanks. The Fathers decided to accede to the requests since there was also a need for a larger chapel to accommodate a growing community.\n\ndoc1136862: Mass (liturgy). The priest enters, with a deacon, if there is one, and altar servers (who may act as crucifer, torch-bearers and thurifer). After making the sign of the cross and greeting the people liturgically, he begins the Act of Penitence. This concludes with the priest's prayer of absolution, \"which, however, lacks the efficacy of the Sacrament of Penance\".[19] The Kyrie, eleison (Lord, have mercy), is sung or said,[20] followed by the Gloria in excelsis Deo (Glory to God in the highest), an ancient praise, if appropriate for the liturgical season.[21] The Introductory Rites are brought to a close by the Collect Prayer.\n\ndoc1063822: Good Friday. In addition to the prescribed liturgical service, the Stations of the Cross are often prayed either in the church or outside, and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00\u00c2\u00a0pm, known as the Three Hours' Agony. In countries such as Malta, Italy, Philippines, Puerto Rico and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2597457: May God have mercy upon your soul. Depending on where it is used, the phrase has had different emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer for the soul of the condemned.[2][3] However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it has only been said as a result of legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.[4]\n\ndoc1792155: Amidah. On public fast days, special prayers for mercy are added to the Amidah. At Shacharit, no changes are made in the silent Amidah, but the chazzan adds an additional blessing in his repetition right after the blessing of Geulah, known by its first word Aneinu (\"Answer us\"). The blessing concludes with the signature \"Blessed are You, O Lord, Who responds (some say: to His nation Israel) in time of trouble.\"\n\ndoc1010824: Liturgical year. By a decree of May 5, 2000, the Second Sunday of Easter (the Sunday after Easter Day itself), is known also in the Roman Rite as the Feast of the Divine Mercy.[39]\n\ndoc2397459: Divine Mercy Sunday. I want the image solemnly blessed on the first Sunday after Easter, and I want it to be venerated publicly so that every soul may know about it.\n\ndoc509835: Trisagion. In the Latin Church, the Trisagion is also employed in the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin. There is also a Chaplet to the Holy Trinity used by the Order of the Most Holy Trinity called 'The Trisagion' or the 'Angelic Trisagion', which makes use of both forms of the Trisagion.[1] It is also used in the hour of Prime, in the ferial Preces, on ferias of Advent and Lent and on common Vigils.\n\ndoc1085758: Beatitudes. In Christian teachings, the Works of Mercy, which have corporal and spiritual components, have resonated with the theme of the Beatitude for mercy.[14] These teachings emphasize that these acts of mercy provide both temporal and spiritual benefits.[1][8] The theme of mercy has continued in devotions such as the Divine Mercy in the 20th century.[15]\n\ndoc161036: Sacrament of Penance. \"God, the Father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his Son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins. Through the ministry of the Church may God give you pardon and peace. And I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\"[43][42][b]\n\ndoc1072049: Pope Francis. With his April 2015 papal bull of indiction, Misericordiae Vultus (Latin: \"The Face of Mercy\"), Francis inaugurated a Special Jubilee Year of Mercy, to run from 8 December 2015, Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to the last Sunday before Advent and the Solemnity of the Feast of Christ the King of the Universe on 20 November 2016.\n\ndoc2397483: Divine Mercy Sunday. Even if the above is impossible to do, the Indulgence is granted if with spiritual intention they unite themselves to the ones carrying on the prescribed practices with the intention of fulfilling the requirements as soon as it is possible.\n\ndoc1063825: Good Friday. The Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as acts of reparation for the sufferings and insults that Jesus suffered during his Passion on Good Friday. These Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the Raccolta Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the Holy See in 1898) which also includes prayers as Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary.[36][37][38][39]\n\ndoc2441012: Confiteor. Outside of Mass some prayers similar to the Confiteor appear earlier. The \"Canonical Rule\" of Chrodegang of Metz (d. 743) recommends: \"First of all prostrate yourself humbly in the sight of God ... and pray Blessed Mary with the holy Apostles and Martyrs and Confessors to pray to the Lord for you.\" And Ecgbert of York (d. 766) gives a short form that is the germ of our present prayer: \"Say to him to whom you wish to confess your sins: through my fault that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed.\" In answer the confessor says almost exactly the Misereatur.[1]\n\ndoc87359: Priesthood in the Catholic Church. Bishop: Do you resolve to implore with us God's mercy upon the people entrusted to your care by observing the command to pray without ceasing?\n\ndoc1072058: Pope Francis. Pope Francis said that the most powerful message of Jesus Christ is mercy.[263] His motto, Miserando atque eligendo, is about Jesus's mercy towards sinners. The phrase is taken from a homily of Saint Bede, who commented that Jesus \"saw the tax collector and, because he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him, he said to him: 'Follow me'\".[e][49] The motto is a reference to the moment when he found his vocation to the priesthood, at the age of 17. He started a day of student celebrations by going to confession.[264]\n\ndoc554946: Parable of the Prodigal Son. In his 1984 apostolic exhortation titled Reconciliatio et paenitentia (Latin for Reconciliation and Penance), Pope John Paul II used this parable to explain the process of conversion and reconciliation. Emphasizing that God the Father is \"rich in mercy\" and always ready to forgive, he stated that reconciliation is a gift on his part. He stated that for the Church her \"mission of reconciliation is the initiative, full of compassionate love and mercy, of that God who is love.\"[10][11] He also explored the issues raised by this parable in his second encyclical Dives in misericordia (Latin for Rich in Mercy) issued in 1980.[12]\n\ndoc1745415: Patronage. The liturgical feast of the Patronage of Our Lady was first permitted by Decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on 6 May 1679, for all the ecclesiastical provinces of Spain, in memory of the victories obtained over the Saracens, heretics and other enemies from the sixth century to the reign of Philip IV of Spain. Pope Benedict XII ordered it to be kept in the Papal States on the third Sunday of November. To other places it is granted, on request, for some Sunday in November, to be designated by the ordinary. In many places the feast of the Patronage is held with an additional Marian title of Queen of All Saints, of Mercy, Mother of Graces. The Office is taken entirely from the Common of the Blessed Virgin, and the Mass is the \"Salve sancta parens\".[6]\n\ndoc2597460: May God have mercy upon your soul. The sentence of this court is that you will be taken from here to the place from whence you came and there be kept in close confinement until [date of execution], and upon that day that you be taken to the place of execution and there hanged by the neck until you are dead. And may God have mercy upon your soul.\n\ndoc974425: Blasphemy. In the Catholic Church, there are specific prayers and devotions as Acts of Reparation for blasphemy.[25] For instance, The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer) first introduced by Sister Marie of St Peter in 1844 is recited \"in a spirit of reparation for blasphemy\". This devotion (started by Sister Marie and then promoted by the Venerable Leo Dupont) was approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885.[26] The Raccoltabook includes a number of such prayers.[27] The Five First Saturdays devotions are done with the intention in the heart of making reparation to the Blessed Mother for blasphemies against her, her name and her holy initiatives.\n\ndoc1072050: Pope Francis. The Holy Doors of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special \"Doors of Mercy\" were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world, where the faithful can earn indulgences by fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the Pope's intentions, confession, and detachment from sin, and communion.[227] During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services will be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called \"Missionaries of Mercy\" will be available in every diocese to forgive even severe, special-case sins normally reserved to the Holy See's Apostolic Penitentiary.[228][229]\n\ndoc2260209: Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. They must not be recited by only one person in prayer, but by an entire congregation, which must consist of at least ten persons, a minyan.[4]\n\ndoc634873: Pharisee and the Publican. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the parable is read as part of the preparatory period leading up to Great Lent. It provides an example of the humility which should be practised during the Lenten period. The Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee begins the three-week pre-Lenten Season and the first use of the liturgical Triodion (although the week following this Sunday is fast-free).[3] This Sunday includes a hymn inspired by the parable:\n\ndoc490644: Pentecost. An extraordinary service called the \"Kneeling Prayer\" is observed on the night of Pentecost. This is a Vespers service to which are added three sets of long poetical prayers, the composition of Saint Basil the Great, during which everyone makes a full prostration, touching their foreheads to the floor (prostrations in church having been forbidden from the day of Pascha (Easter) up to this point).  Uniquely, these prayers include a petition for all of those in hell, that they may be granted relief and even ultimate release from their confinement, if God deems this possible.[27]\n\ndoc2624812: Yom Tov Torah readings. When Shabbat occurs on Chol Hamoed of either Sukkot or Passover, Exodus 33:12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c34:26 is read.[27] Since this is on Shabbat, it is always divided into seven readings. This reading contains the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. The individual readings are listed with the readings for Passover and Sukkot.\n\ndoc12933: Lord's Prayer. \"And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us;\"\n\ndoc1024752: Holy Week. On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection.\nThe Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare, until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes for paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.[27]\n\ndoc1072060: Pope Francis. In March 2015, Pope Francis announced that the universal church would celebrate a Jubilee Year from 8 December 2015 to 20 November 2016, dedicated to the theme of God's mercy. The Vatican announced the pope would perform several acts to demonstrate the theme of God's mercy.[270]\n\ndoc1024812: Holy Week. Since the liturgical day starts from the evening before a calendar day, the prayers of Palm Sunday begin on the evening of Lazarus' Saturday.\n\ndoc2289152: Repentance in Islam. The use of the verse \"In the name of Allah, the Benevolent, the Merciful\" at the beginning of every sura (except one) further testifies to this fact. According to the narration of Quran and Hadith, Allah's overarching mercy permits even the gravest sins to be pardoned by Him, provided the wrongdoer intends a sincere tawba. Allah says:\n\ndoc2142991: Prayer in the Catholic Church. Thankfulness is thanking God for what he has given and done.[18]\n\ndoc582515: Rosary. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a0 Note: It is customary to pray only the Sorrowful Mysteries during the seasons of Septuagesima and Lent, regardless of the day of week.\n\ndoc2260205: Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. According to the explanation of Maimonides these attributes must not be regarded as qualities inherent in God, but as the method of His activity, by which the divine governance appears to the human observer to be controlled.[1] In the Sifre, however, these attributes are not called \"middot\", which may mean \"quality\" as well as \"rule\" and \"measure\", but \"derakim\" (ways), since they are the ways of God which Moses prayed to know and which God proclaimed to him.\n\ndoc1442902: Hanukkah. The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) (Psalms 113 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Psalms 118) are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[94][96]\n\ndoc1954515: The Mercy Seat (song). This section is repeated fifteen times during the course of the song, with a number of variations in the text. Specific allusions to scripture include those to Leviticus 16:11\u201319 and Leviticus 24:19\u201321.[2]\n\ndoc1063809: Good Friday. May Christ our true God, Who for the salvation of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother, of our holy and God-bearing fathers, and of all the saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind.\n\ndoc1024803: Holy Week. Vespers joined to the Divine Liturgy is served on Great and Holy Saturday, prescribed by the Liturgical books to be served in the afternoon but often served in the morning. This is the Proti Anastasi (First Resurrection) service, commemorating the Harrowing of Hell. Just before the reading of the Gospel, the hangings and vestments and changed from dark lenten colors to white, and the entire mood of the service changes from mourning to joy. However, the faithful do not yet greet one another with the Paschal kiss, since the Resurrection has not yet been announced to the living.\n\ndoc1212397: Eastertide. Since 2000 the Second Sunday of Easter is also called Divine Mercy Sunday. The name \"Low Sunday\" for this Sunday, once common in English, is now rarely used.\n\ndoc2597456: May God have mercy upon your soul. \"May God have mercy upon your soul\" or \"may God have mercy on your soul\" is a phrase used within courts in various legal systems by judges pronouncing a sentence of death upon a person found guilty of a crime that requires a death sentence. The phrase originated in beth din courts in the Kingdom of Israel as a way to attribute God as the highest authority in law.[1] The usage of the phrase later spread to England and Wales' legal system and from there to usage throughout the colonies of the British Empire whenever a death sentence was passed.\n\ndoc1010787: Liturgical year. The Book of Common Prayer contains within it the traditional Western Eucharistic lectionary which traces its roots to the Comes of St. Jerome in the 5th century.[12] Its similarity to the ancient lectionary is particularly obvious during Trinity season (Sundays after the Sunday after Pentecost), reflecting that understanding of sanctification.[13]\n\ndoc2107747: God in Islam. His mercy takes many forms from as he say in the Quran \"and My Mercy embraces all things.\u201d [7:156] this is shown by a in Muslim narrated from Abu Hurairah said the Prophet said\u00a0: \u201cAllah has one hundred parts of mercy, of which He sent down one between the jinn, mankind, the animals and the insects, by means of which they are compassionate and merciful to one another, and by means of which wild animals are kind to their offspring. And Allah has kept back ninety-nine parts of mercy with which to be merciful to His slaves of the Day of Resurrection.\u201d[34][35] Also God's mercy according to Islamic theology is what gets a person into paradise. According to Hadith in Shahih Al Bukhari \u201cNo one\u2019s deeds will ever admit him to Paradise.\u201d They said, \u201cNot even you, O Messenger of Allah?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, not even me, unless Allah showers me with His Mercy. So try to be near to perfection. And no one should wish for death; he is either doing good so he will do more of that, or he is doing wrong so he may repent.\u201d[35][36]\n\ndoc884708: Holy day of obligation. (See Liturgy Office)\n\ndoc1353822: Works of mercy. Based on Jesus' doctrine of the sheep and the goats, the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a means of grace as good deeds[5] and their omission is a reason for damnation.[6] Because the Messianic Age will be a time of mercy,[7] and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming[8] and believes Jesus obeyed every mitzvah and fulfilled the Scriptures,[9] Catholics perform the works of mercy.[10]\n\n"

This prayer is optional, and may be used after the Holy God to end the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24190: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. According to Roman Catholic tradition, the chaplet may be said at any time, but it is said especially on Divine Mercy Sunday and Fridays at 3:00 PM. The Chaplet is prayed daily at the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In the Philippines, Singapore, and Hong Kong the \"3 o'clock Prayer\" is broadcast on radio and television stations daily at 3:00 p.m. In 2000, Pope John Paul II ordained the Sunday after Easter Divine Mercy Sunday, where Roman Catholics remember the institution of the Sacrament of Penance. The hour Jesus died by crucifixion, 3:00 PM (15:00), is called the Hour of Mercy. In a novena, the chaplet is usually said each of the nine days from Good Friday to Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\ndoc24184: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that she received the prayer through visions and conversations with Jesus, who made specific promises regarding the recitation of the prayers.[2] Her Vatican biography quotes some of these conversations.[4]\n\ndoc24187: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. According to Faustina's visions, written in her diary, the chaplet's prayers for mercy are threefold: to obtain mercy, to trust in Christ's mercy, and to show mercy to others.[6][10][11] Faustina wrote that Jesus promised that all who recite this chaplet at the hour of death or in the presence of the dying will receive great mercy. She wrote that Jesus said:\n\ndoc24195: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated three times in succession, is also optional, and may be used along with the first opening prayer to begin the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24200: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc24199: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated 10 times in succession, forms the body of each decade of the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24192: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\n\ndoc24204: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.[14]\n\ndoc24208: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. To conclude:\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc24207: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24209: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc2397475: Divine Mercy Sunday. The liturgical celebration of Divine Mercy Sunday reflects the devotional elements of Divine Mercy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first prayer of that Mass beginning with:\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc2397479: Divine Mercy Sunday. In June 2002, John Paul II granted indulgences to Catholics who recite specific prayers on that day, which were then formally decreed by the Apostolic Penitentiary.[5] The priests are also ordered in that day to lead the prayers in honor of Divine Mercy, inform the parishioners about the Divine Mercy, and hear confessions.[5]\n\ndoc2397457: Divine Mercy Sunday. The feast of Divine Mercy, as recorded in the diary of Saint Faustyna, receives from Jesus himself the biggest promises of grace related to the Devotion of Divine Mercy. In specific, Jesus said that a person who goes to sacramental confession (the confession may take place some days before) and receives holy communion on that day, shall obtain the total forgiveness of all sins and punishment. That means each person would go immediately after death to heaven without suffering in purgatory (or hell). Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church grants a plenary indulgence (observing the usual rules) with the recitation of some simple prayers.[4][5][6]\n\ndoc24206: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet is begun on the short strand of the rosary beads:\n\ndoc24196: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fountain of Mercy for us, I trust in You![14]\n\ndoc2397480: Divine Mercy Sunday. This Plenary Indulgence is obtained by observing the usual dispositions that are on place for the granting of this grace through the Intercession of the Catholic Church, that is: Sacramental Confession (the confession may take place some days before), Holy Communion, to pray for the intentions of the pope (an Our Father and Hail Mary is minimum requirement), when the faithful detached from any sin, even venial, either:\n\ndoc2397466: Divine Mercy Sunday. Ask of my faithful servant [a priest] that, on this day, he tell the whole world of My great mercy; that whoever approaches the Fountain of Life on this day will be granted complete forgiveness of sins and punishment. Mankind will not have peace until it turns with trust to My mercy.\n\ndoc2397463: Divine Mercy Sunday. This Feast emerged from the very depths of My mercy, and it is confirmed in the vast depths of my tender mercies. Every soul believing and trusting in My mercy will obtain it.\n\ndoc2397482: Divine Mercy Sunday. Additionally, for the faithful who, for a justified reason beyond their control, are unable to go to church or chapel, may obtain forgiveness with the recitation of one Our Father and Creed before a devout image of Jesus adding \"Merciful Jesus, I Trust in you.\" They will receive the plenary Indulgence that day with the condition of fulfilling the usual sacramental requirements at a later time.\n\ndoc2397458: Divine Mercy Sunday. Faustyna Kowalska, a Polish nun reported visions and visitations from Jesus and conversations with Him. He asked her to paint the vision of His Merciful Divinity being poured from His sacred heart and specifically asked for a feast of Divine Mercy to be established on the first Sunday after Easter so mankind would take refuge in Him:[7][8]\n\ndoc2397468: Divine Mercy Sunday. I want to grant a complete pardon to the souls that will go to Confession and receive Holy Communion on the Feast of My Mercy.\n\ndoc2397473: Divine Mercy Sunday. Jesus said to St. Faustyna one day: \"Humanity will never find peace until it turns with trust to Divine Mercy\". Divine Mercy! This is the Easter gift that the Church receives from the risen Christ and offers to humanity.[17]\n\ndoc2397470: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday is also the day after the culmination of the novena of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy.[10][11] Faustyna wrote Jesus instructed her that the Feast of Mercy (the Sunday after Easter) be preceded by a Divine Mercy Novena which would begin on Good Friday.[10]\n\ndoc2397474: Divine Mercy Sunday. The devotion to Divine Mercy Sunday grew rapidly after its designation by Pope John Paul II and is now widely celebrated by Catholics.[18] The Divine Mercy image is often carried in processions on Divine Mercy Sunday, and is placed in a location in the church so that it can be venerated by those who attended the Mass.[18]\n\ndoc2397456: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday (also known as the Feast of the Divine Mercy) is celebrated on the Sunday after Easter, the Octave Day of Easter. The feast day is observed by Roman Catholic as well as some Anglicans.[3] It is originally based on the Catholic devotion to the Divine Mercy that Saint Faustyna Kowalska reported as part of her encounter with Jesus, and is associated with special promises from Jesus and indulgences issued by the Church.\n\ndoc2397477: Divine Mercy Sunday. This opening prayer refers to Divine Mercy as the key element in the plan of God for salvation and emphasizes the belief that it was through mercy that God gave his only son for the redemption of mankind, after the fall of Adam.[19]\n\ndoc2397472: Divine Mercy Sunday. The devotion was actively promoted by Pope John Paul II. On April 30, 2000, the Canonization of Faustyna Kowalska took place and the Sunday after Easter was officially designated as the Sunday of the Divine Mercy (Dominica II Paschae seu de divina misericordia) in the General Roman Calendar.[15][16] On April 22, 2001, which was one year after establishing Divine Mercy Sunday, Pope John Paul II re-emphasized its message in the resurrection context of Easter:\n\ndoc24188: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. \"....When they say this Chaplet in the presence of the dying, I will stand between My Father and the dying not as the just judge but as the Merciful Savior.\"\n\ndoc24198: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Eternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc2397465: Divine Mercy Sunday. In several entries in her diary, Faustyna recorded promises of Grace and Mercy associated to the Feast of Divine Mercy on Mercy Sunday. Jesus Stated:[9]\n\ndoc2397476: Divine Mercy Sunday. Heavenly Father and God of Mercy, We no longer look for Jesus among the dead, for He is alive and has become the Lord of Life.[19]\n\ndoc24211: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The novena intentions for each day are:\n\ndoc2397460: Divine Mercy Sunday. Let all mankind recognize My unfathomable mercy. It is a sign for the end times; after it will come the day of justice.\n\ndoc2397462: Divine Mercy Sunday. Sunday, April 28, 1935. Low Sunday; that is, the Feast of The Divine Mercy, the conclusion of the Jubilee of Redemption. When we went to take part in the celebrations, my heart leapt with joy that the two solemnities were so closely united.\n\ndoc2397467: Divine Mercy Sunday. I desire that the Feast of Mercy be a refuge and shelter for all souls, and especially for poor sinners. On that day, the very depths of My tender mercy are open. I pour out a whole ocean of graces upon those souls who approach the fount of My mercy. The soul that will go to Confession and receive Holy Communion shall obtain the complete forgiveness of sins and punishment. On that day all the divine floodgates through which grace flow are opened. Let no soul fear to draw near to Me, even though its sins be as scarlet.\n\ndoc2397461: Divine Mercy Sunday. Souls perish in spite of My bitter Passion. I am giving them the last hope of salvation; that is, the Feast of My Mercy. If they will not adore My mercy, they will perish for all eternity\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 tell souls about this great mercy of Mine, because the awful day, the day of My justice, is near.\n\ndoc24210: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. These souls cause Me more suffering than any others; it was from such souls that My soul felt the most revulsion in the Garden of Olives. It was on their account that I said: \"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass Me by.\" The last hope of salvation for them is to flee to My Mercy.\"[16]\n\ndoc2397481: Divine Mercy Sunday. ...in both cases, adding a devout prayer to the Merciful Lord (i.e. \"Merciful Jesus, I trust in You.\").\n\ndoc2397464: Divine Mercy Sunday. Yes, the first Sunday after Easter is the Feast of Mercy, but there must also be deeds of mercy, which are to arise out of love for Me. You are to show mercy to our neighbors always and everywhere. You must not shrink from this or try to absolve yourself from it.\n\ndoc24194: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.[14]\n\ndoc1353821: Works of mercy. Pope John Paul II issued a papal encyclical \"Dives in misericordia\" on 30 November 1980 declaring that \"Jesus Christ taught that man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but that he is also called \"to practice mercy\" towards others.[4] Another notable devotion associated with the works of mercy is the Divine Mercy, which are reputed to be apparitions of Jesus Christ to Saint Faustina Kowalska.\n\ndoc2397469: Divine Mercy Sunday. On March 23, 1937, Faustyna wrote in her diary (Notebook III, item 1044) that she had a vision that the feast of Divine Mercy would be celebrated in her local chapel, and would be attended by large crowds, and that the same celebration would be held in Rome attended by the Pope.[4][6] She wrote: \"The crowd was so enormous that the eye could not take it all in. Everyone was participating in the celebrations.\"[4]\n\ndoc1353823: Works of mercy. In particular cases, a given individual will not be obligated or even competent to perform four of the spiritual works of mercy, namely: instructing the ignorant, counseling the doubtful, admonishing sinners, and comforting the afflicted. These works may require a definitely superior level of authority or knowledge or an extraordinary amount of tact. The other works of mercy, however, are considered to be an obligation of all faithful to practise unconditionally.[11] In an address on the 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation, Pope Francis suggested \"care for creation\" as a new work of mercy. Corporally, it means simple daily gestures of peace and love; spiritually, it means contemplation of the world.[12]\n\ndoc1016756: Dua. Once a man said, \"O God, forgive me and have mercy and have mercy on me!\" This was after the man had finished two raka'ats. Prophet Muhammad said, \"You have been hasty, O worshipper! When you finish your prayer, then sit down and praise God with the praise that he is worthy of, and recite durood upon me, then state your du'a...\"[25]\n\ndoc2397471: Divine Mercy Sunday. The first Mass during which the Divine Mercy image was displayed was on April 28, 1935, the first Sunday after Easter (the Feast of Divine Mercy) and was attended by Sr. Faustyna. (Diary of St. Faustyna, item 420).[12] April 28, 1935 was also the celebration of the end of the Jubilee of the Redemption by Pope Pius XI.[12][13] Father Michael Sopocko (Faustyna's confessor) celebrated the Mass that Sunday and obtained permission to place the image within the Gate of Dawn church in Vilnius during the Mass.[12][14]\n\ndoc599181: National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts). Pilgrims began to arrive the very next spring to celebrate the Feast of The Divine Mercy (just after Easter). By the end of World War II in 1945, pilgrims in growing numbers came to offer thanksgiving for graces received through the Divine Mercy message and devotion. They urged the Marians to build a shrine to Jesus, The Divine Mercy, as a votive of thanks. The Fathers decided to accede to the requests since there was also a need for a larger chapel to accommodate a growing community.\n\ndoc1136862: Mass (liturgy). The priest enters, with a deacon, if there is one, and altar servers (who may act as crucifer, torch-bearers and thurifer). After making the sign of the cross and greeting the people liturgically, he begins the Act of Penitence. This concludes with the priest's prayer of absolution, \"which, however, lacks the efficacy of the Sacrament of Penance\".[19] The Kyrie, eleison (Lord, have mercy), is sung or said,[20] followed by the Gloria in excelsis Deo (Glory to God in the highest), an ancient praise, if appropriate for the liturgical season.[21] The Introductory Rites are brought to a close by the Collect Prayer.\n\ndoc1063822: Good Friday. In addition to the prescribed liturgical service, the Stations of the Cross are often prayed either in the church or outside, and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00\u00c2\u00a0pm, known as the Three Hours' Agony. In countries such as Malta, Italy, Philippines, Puerto Rico and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2597457: May God have mercy upon your soul. Depending on where it is used, the phrase has had different emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer for the soul of the condemned.[2][3] However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it has only been said as a result of legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.[4]\n\ndoc1792155: Amidah. On public fast days, special prayers for mercy are added to the Amidah. At Shacharit, no changes are made in the silent Amidah, but the chazzan adds an additional blessing in his repetition right after the blessing of Geulah, known by its first word Aneinu (\"Answer us\"). The blessing concludes with the signature \"Blessed are You, O Lord, Who responds (some say: to His nation Israel) in time of trouble.\"\n\ndoc1010824: Liturgical year. By a decree of May 5, 2000, the Second Sunday of Easter (the Sunday after Easter Day itself), is known also in the Roman Rite as the Feast of the Divine Mercy.[39]\n\ndoc2397459: Divine Mercy Sunday. I want the image solemnly blessed on the first Sunday after Easter, and I want it to be venerated publicly so that every soul may know about it.\n\ndoc509835: Trisagion. In the Latin Church, the Trisagion is also employed in the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin. There is also a Chaplet to the Holy Trinity used by the Order of the Most Holy Trinity called 'The Trisagion' or the 'Angelic Trisagion', which makes use of both forms of the Trisagion.[1] It is also used in the hour of Prime, in the ferial Preces, on ferias of Advent and Lent and on common Vigils.\n\ndoc1085758: Beatitudes. In Christian teachings, the Works of Mercy, which have corporal and spiritual components, have resonated with the theme of the Beatitude for mercy.[14] These teachings emphasize that these acts of mercy provide both temporal and spiritual benefits.[1][8] The theme of mercy has continued in devotions such as the Divine Mercy in the 20th century.[15]\n\ndoc161036: Sacrament of Penance. \"God, the Father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his Son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins. Through the ministry of the Church may God give you pardon and peace. And I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\"[43][42][b]\n\ndoc1072049: Pope Francis. With his April 2015 papal bull of indiction, Misericordiae Vultus (Latin: \"The Face of Mercy\"), Francis inaugurated a Special Jubilee Year of Mercy, to run from 8 December 2015, Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to the last Sunday before Advent and the Solemnity of the Feast of Christ the King of the Universe on 20 November 2016.\n\ndoc2397483: Divine Mercy Sunday. Even if the above is impossible to do, the Indulgence is granted if with spiritual intention they unite themselves to the ones carrying on the prescribed practices with the intention of fulfilling the requirements as soon as it is possible.\n\ndoc1063825: Good Friday. The Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as acts of reparation for the sufferings and insults that Jesus suffered during his Passion on Good Friday. These Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the Raccolta Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the Holy See in 1898) which also includes prayers as Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary.[36][37][38][39]\n\ndoc2441012: Confiteor. Outside of Mass some prayers similar to the Confiteor appear earlier. The \"Canonical Rule\" of Chrodegang of Metz (d. 743) recommends: \"First of all prostrate yourself humbly in the sight of God ... and pray Blessed Mary with the holy Apostles and Martyrs and Confessors to pray to the Lord for you.\" And Ecgbert of York (d. 766) gives a short form that is the germ of our present prayer: \"Say to him to whom you wish to confess your sins: through my fault that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed.\" In answer the confessor says almost exactly the Misereatur.[1]\n\ndoc87359: Priesthood in the Catholic Church. Bishop: Do you resolve to implore with us God's mercy upon the people entrusted to your care by observing the command to pray without ceasing?\n\ndoc1072058: Pope Francis. Pope Francis said that the most powerful message of Jesus Christ is mercy.[263] His motto, Miserando atque eligendo, is about Jesus's mercy towards sinners. The phrase is taken from a homily of Saint Bede, who commented that Jesus \"saw the tax collector and, because he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him, he said to him: 'Follow me'\".[e][49] The motto is a reference to the moment when he found his vocation to the priesthood, at the age of 17. He started a day of student celebrations by going to confession.[264]\n\ndoc554946: Parable of the Prodigal Son. In his 1984 apostolic exhortation titled Reconciliatio et paenitentia (Latin for Reconciliation and Penance), Pope John Paul II used this parable to explain the process of conversion and reconciliation. Emphasizing that God the Father is \"rich in mercy\" and always ready to forgive, he stated that reconciliation is a gift on his part. He stated that for the Church her \"mission of reconciliation is the initiative, full of compassionate love and mercy, of that God who is love.\"[10][11] He also explored the issues raised by this parable in his second encyclical Dives in misericordia (Latin for Rich in Mercy) issued in 1980.[12]\n\ndoc1745415: Patronage. The liturgical feast of the Patronage of Our Lady was first permitted by Decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on 6 May 1679, for all the ecclesiastical provinces of Spain, in memory of the victories obtained over the Saracens, heretics and other enemies from the sixth century to the reign of Philip IV of Spain. Pope Benedict XII ordered it to be kept in the Papal States on the third Sunday of November. To other places it is granted, on request, for some Sunday in November, to be designated by the ordinary. In many places the feast of the Patronage is held with an additional Marian title of Queen of All Saints, of Mercy, Mother of Graces. The Office is taken entirely from the Common of the Blessed Virgin, and the Mass is the \"Salve sancta parens\".[6]\n\ndoc2597460: May God have mercy upon your soul. The sentence of this court is that you will be taken from here to the place from whence you came and there be kept in close confinement until [date of execution], and upon that day that you be taken to the place of execution and there hanged by the neck until you are dead. And may God have mercy upon your soul.\n\ndoc974425: Blasphemy. In the Catholic Church, there are specific prayers and devotions as Acts of Reparation for blasphemy.[25] For instance, The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer) first introduced by Sister Marie of St Peter in 1844 is recited \"in a spirit of reparation for blasphemy\". This devotion (started by Sister Marie and then promoted by the Venerable Leo Dupont) was approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885.[26] The Raccoltabook includes a number of such prayers.[27] The Five First Saturdays devotions are done with the intention in the heart of making reparation to the Blessed Mother for blasphemies against her, her name and her holy initiatives.\n\ndoc1072050: Pope Francis. The Holy Doors of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special \"Doors of Mercy\" were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world, where the faithful can earn indulgences by fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the Pope's intentions, confession, and detachment from sin, and communion.[227] During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services will be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called \"Missionaries of Mercy\" will be available in every diocese to forgive even severe, special-case sins normally reserved to the Holy See's Apostolic Penitentiary.[228][229]\n\ndoc2260209: Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. They must not be recited by only one person in prayer, but by an entire congregation, which must consist of at least ten persons, a minyan.[4]\n\ndoc634873: Pharisee and the Publican. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the parable is read as part of the preparatory period leading up to Great Lent. It provides an example of the humility which should be practised during the Lenten period. The Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee begins the three-week pre-Lenten Season and the first use of the liturgical Triodion (although the week following this Sunday is fast-free).[3] This Sunday includes a hymn inspired by the parable:\n\ndoc490644: Pentecost. An extraordinary service called the \"Kneeling Prayer\" is observed on the night of Pentecost. This is a Vespers service to which are added three sets of long poetical prayers, the composition of Saint Basil the Great, during which everyone makes a full prostration, touching their foreheads to the floor (prostrations in church having been forbidden from the day of Pascha (Easter) up to this point).  Uniquely, these prayers include a petition for all of those in hell, that they may be granted relief and even ultimate release from their confinement, if God deems this possible.[27]\n\ndoc2624812: Yom Tov Torah readings. When Shabbat occurs on Chol Hamoed of either Sukkot or Passover, Exodus 33:12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c34:26 is read.[27] Since this is on Shabbat, it is always divided into seven readings. This reading contains the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. The individual readings are listed with the readings for Passover and Sukkot.\n\ndoc12933: Lord's Prayer. \"And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us;\"\n\ndoc1024752: Holy Week. On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection.\nThe Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare, until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes for paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.[27]\n\ndoc1072060: Pope Francis. In March 2015, Pope Francis announced that the universal church would celebrate a Jubilee Year from 8 December 2015 to 20 November 2016, dedicated to the theme of God's mercy. The Vatican announced the pope would perform several acts to demonstrate the theme of God's mercy.[270]\n\ndoc1024812: Holy Week. Since the liturgical day starts from the evening before a calendar day, the prayers of Palm Sunday begin on the evening of Lazarus' Saturday.\n\ndoc2289152: Repentance in Islam. The use of the verse \"In the name of Allah, the Benevolent, the Merciful\" at the beginning of every sura (except one) further testifies to this fact. According to the narration of Quran and Hadith, Allah's overarching mercy permits even the gravest sins to be pardoned by Him, provided the wrongdoer intends a sincere tawba. Allah says:\n\ndoc2142991: Prayer in the Catholic Church. Thankfulness is thanking God for what he has given and done.[18]\n\ndoc582515: Rosary. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a0 Note: It is customary to pray only the Sorrowful Mysteries during the seasons of Septuagesima and Lent, regardless of the day of week.\n\ndoc2260205: Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. According to the explanation of Maimonides these attributes must not be regarded as qualities inherent in God, but as the method of His activity, by which the divine governance appears to the human observer to be controlled.[1] In the Sifre, however, these attributes are not called \"middot\", which may mean \"quality\" as well as \"rule\" and \"measure\", but \"derakim\" (ways), since they are the ways of God which Moses prayed to know and which God proclaimed to him.\n\ndoc1442902: Hanukkah. The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) (Psalms 113 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Psalms 118) are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[94][96]\n\ndoc1954515: The Mercy Seat (song). This section is repeated fifteen times during the course of the song, with a number of variations in the text. Specific allusions to scripture include those to Leviticus 16:11\u201319 and Leviticus 24:19\u201321.[2]\n\ndoc1063809: Good Friday. May Christ our true God, Who for the salvation of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother, of our holy and God-bearing fathers, and of all the saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind.\n\ndoc1024803: Holy Week. Vespers joined to the Divine Liturgy is served on Great and Holy Saturday, prescribed by the Liturgical books to be served in the afternoon but often served in the morning. This is the Proti Anastasi (First Resurrection) service, commemorating the Harrowing of Hell. Just before the reading of the Gospel, the hangings and vestments and changed from dark lenten colors to white, and the entire mood of the service changes from mourning to joy. However, the faithful do not yet greet one another with the Paschal kiss, since the Resurrection has not yet been announced to the living.\n\ndoc1212397: Eastertide. Since 2000 the Second Sunday of Easter is also called Divine Mercy Sunday. The name \"Low Sunday\" for this Sunday, once common in English, is now rarely used.\n\ndoc2597456: May God have mercy upon your soul. \"May God have mercy upon your soul\" or \"may God have mercy on your soul\" is a phrase used within courts in various legal systems by judges pronouncing a sentence of death upon a person found guilty of a crime that requires a death sentence. The phrase originated in beth din courts in the Kingdom of Israel as a way to attribute God as the highest authority in law.[1] The usage of the phrase later spread to England and Wales' legal system and from there to usage throughout the colonies of the British Empire whenever a death sentence was passed.\n\ndoc1010787: Liturgical year. The Book of Common Prayer contains within it the traditional Western Eucharistic lectionary which traces its roots to the Comes of St. Jerome in the 5th century.[12] Its similarity to the ancient lectionary is particularly obvious during Trinity season (Sundays after the Sunday after Pentecost), reflecting that understanding of sanctification.[13]\n\ndoc2107747: God in Islam. His mercy takes many forms from as he say in the Quran \"and My Mercy embraces all things.\u201d [7:156] this is shown by a in Muslim narrated from Abu Hurairah said the Prophet said\u00a0: \u201cAllah has one hundred parts of mercy, of which He sent down one between the jinn, mankind, the animals and the insects, by means of which they are compassionate and merciful to one another, and by means of which wild animals are kind to their offspring. And Allah has kept back ninety-nine parts of mercy with which to be merciful to His slaves of the Day of Resurrection.\u201d[34][35] Also God's mercy according to Islamic theology is what gets a person into paradise. According to Hadith in Shahih Al Bukhari \u201cNo one\u2019s deeds will ever admit him to Paradise.\u201d They said, \u201cNot even you, O Messenger of Allah?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, not even me, unless Allah showers me with His Mercy. So try to be near to perfection. And no one should wish for death; he is either doing good so he will do more of that, or he is doing wrong so he may repent.\u201d[35][36]\n\ndoc884708: Holy day of obligation. (See Liturgy Office)\n\ndoc1353822: Works of mercy. Based on Jesus' doctrine of the sheep and the goats, the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a means of grace as good deeds[5] and their omission is a reason for damnation.[6] Because the Messianic Age will be a time of mercy,[7] and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming[8] and believes Jesus obeyed every mitzvah and fulfilled the Scriptures,[9] Catholics perform the works of mercy.[10]\n\n"

This prayer opens each decade of the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24201: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated three times in succession, concludes the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24193: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer is optional, and may be used to begin the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24203: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer is optional, and may be used after the Holy God to end the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24190: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. According to Roman Catholic tradition, the chaplet may be said at any time, but it is said especially on Divine Mercy Sunday and Fridays at 3:00 PM. The Chaplet is prayed daily at the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In the Philippines, Singapore, and Hong Kong the \"3 o'clock Prayer\" is broadcast on radio and television stations daily at 3:00 p.m. In 2000, Pope John Paul II ordained the Sunday after Easter Divine Mercy Sunday, where Roman Catholics remember the institution of the Sacrament of Penance. The hour Jesus died by crucifixion, 3:00 PM (15:00), is called the Hour of Mercy. In a novena, the chaplet is usually said each of the nine days from Good Friday to Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\ndoc24184: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that she received the prayer through visions and conversations with Jesus, who made specific promises regarding the recitation of the prayers.[2] Her Vatican biography quotes some of these conversations.[4]\n\ndoc24187: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. According to Faustina's visions, written in her diary, the chaplet's prayers for mercy are threefold: to obtain mercy, to trust in Christ's mercy, and to show mercy to others.[6][10][11] Faustina wrote that Jesus promised that all who recite this chaplet at the hour of death or in the presence of the dying will receive great mercy. She wrote that Jesus said:\n\ndoc24195: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated three times in succession, is also optional, and may be used along with the first opening prayer to begin the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24200: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc24199: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated 10 times in succession, forms the body of each decade of the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24192: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\n\ndoc24204: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.[14]\n\ndoc24208: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. To conclude:\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc24207: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24209: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc2397475: Divine Mercy Sunday. The liturgical celebration of Divine Mercy Sunday reflects the devotional elements of Divine Mercy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first prayer of that Mass beginning with:\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc2397479: Divine Mercy Sunday. In June 2002, John Paul II granted indulgences to Catholics who recite specific prayers on that day, which were then formally decreed by the Apostolic Penitentiary.[5] The priests are also ordered in that day to lead the prayers in honor of Divine Mercy, inform the parishioners about the Divine Mercy, and hear confessions.[5]\n\ndoc2397457: Divine Mercy Sunday. The feast of Divine Mercy, as recorded in the diary of Saint Faustyna, receives from Jesus himself the biggest promises of grace related to the Devotion of Divine Mercy. In specific, Jesus said that a person who goes to sacramental confession (the confession may take place some days before) and receives holy communion on that day, shall obtain the total forgiveness of all sins and punishment. That means each person would go immediately after death to heaven without suffering in purgatory (or hell). Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church grants a plenary indulgence (observing the usual rules) with the recitation of some simple prayers.[4][5][6]\n\ndoc24206: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet is begun on the short strand of the rosary beads:\n\ndoc24196: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fountain of Mercy for us, I trust in You![14]\n\ndoc2397480: Divine Mercy Sunday. This Plenary Indulgence is obtained by observing the usual dispositions that are on place for the granting of this grace through the Intercession of the Catholic Church, that is: Sacramental Confession (the confession may take place some days before), Holy Communion, to pray for the intentions of the pope (an Our Father and Hail Mary is minimum requirement), when the faithful detached from any sin, even venial, either:\n\ndoc2397466: Divine Mercy Sunday. Ask of my faithful servant [a priest] that, on this day, he tell the whole world of My great mercy; that whoever approaches the Fountain of Life on this day will be granted complete forgiveness of sins and punishment. Mankind will not have peace until it turns with trust to My mercy.\n\ndoc2397463: Divine Mercy Sunday. This Feast emerged from the very depths of My mercy, and it is confirmed in the vast depths of my tender mercies. Every soul believing and trusting in My mercy will obtain it.\n\ndoc2397482: Divine Mercy Sunday. Additionally, for the faithful who, for a justified reason beyond their control, are unable to go to church or chapel, may obtain forgiveness with the recitation of one Our Father and Creed before a devout image of Jesus adding \"Merciful Jesus, I Trust in you.\" They will receive the plenary Indulgence that day with the condition of fulfilling the usual sacramental requirements at a later time.\n\ndoc2397458: Divine Mercy Sunday. Faustyna Kowalska, a Polish nun reported visions and visitations from Jesus and conversations with Him. He asked her to paint the vision of His Merciful Divinity being poured from His sacred heart and specifically asked for a feast of Divine Mercy to be established on the first Sunday after Easter so mankind would take refuge in Him:[7][8]\n\ndoc2397468: Divine Mercy Sunday. I want to grant a complete pardon to the souls that will go to Confession and receive Holy Communion on the Feast of My Mercy.\n\ndoc2397473: Divine Mercy Sunday. Jesus said to St. Faustyna one day: \"Humanity will never find peace until it turns with trust to Divine Mercy\". Divine Mercy! This is the Easter gift that the Church receives from the risen Christ and offers to humanity.[17]\n\ndoc2397470: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday is also the day after the culmination of the novena of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy.[10][11] Faustyna wrote Jesus instructed her that the Feast of Mercy (the Sunday after Easter) be preceded by a Divine Mercy Novena which would begin on Good Friday.[10]\n\ndoc2397474: Divine Mercy Sunday. The devotion to Divine Mercy Sunday grew rapidly after its designation by Pope John Paul II and is now widely celebrated by Catholics.[18] The Divine Mercy image is often carried in processions on Divine Mercy Sunday, and is placed in a location in the church so that it can be venerated by those who attended the Mass.[18]\n\ndoc2397456: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday (also known as the Feast of the Divine Mercy) is celebrated on the Sunday after Easter, the Octave Day of Easter. The feast day is observed by Roman Catholic as well as some Anglicans.[3] It is originally based on the Catholic devotion to the Divine Mercy that Saint Faustyna Kowalska reported as part of her encounter with Jesus, and is associated with special promises from Jesus and indulgences issued by the Church.\n\ndoc2397477: Divine Mercy Sunday. This opening prayer refers to Divine Mercy as the key element in the plan of God for salvation and emphasizes the belief that it was through mercy that God gave his only son for the redemption of mankind, after the fall of Adam.[19]\n\ndoc2397472: Divine Mercy Sunday. The devotion was actively promoted by Pope John Paul II. On April 30, 2000, the Canonization of Faustyna Kowalska took place and the Sunday after Easter was officially designated as the Sunday of the Divine Mercy (Dominica II Paschae seu de divina misericordia) in the General Roman Calendar.[15][16] On April 22, 2001, which was one year after establishing Divine Mercy Sunday, Pope John Paul II re-emphasized its message in the resurrection context of Easter:\n\ndoc24188: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. \"....When they say this Chaplet in the presence of the dying, I will stand between My Father and the dying not as the just judge but as the Merciful Savior.\"\n\ndoc24198: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Eternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc2397465: Divine Mercy Sunday. In several entries in her diary, Faustyna recorded promises of Grace and Mercy associated to the Feast of Divine Mercy on Mercy Sunday. Jesus Stated:[9]\n\ndoc2397476: Divine Mercy Sunday. Heavenly Father and God of Mercy, We no longer look for Jesus among the dead, for He is alive and has become the Lord of Life.[19]\n\ndoc24211: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The novena intentions for each day are:\n\ndoc2397460: Divine Mercy Sunday. Let all mankind recognize My unfathomable mercy. It is a sign for the end times; after it will come the day of justice.\n\ndoc2397462: Divine Mercy Sunday. Sunday, April 28, 1935. Low Sunday; that is, the Feast of The Divine Mercy, the conclusion of the Jubilee of Redemption. When we went to take part in the celebrations, my heart leapt with joy that the two solemnities were so closely united.\n\ndoc2397467: Divine Mercy Sunday. I desire that the Feast of Mercy be a refuge and shelter for all souls, and especially for poor sinners. On that day, the very depths of My tender mercy are open. I pour out a whole ocean of graces upon those souls who approach the fount of My mercy. The soul that will go to Confession and receive Holy Communion shall obtain the complete forgiveness of sins and punishment. On that day all the divine floodgates through which grace flow are opened. Let no soul fear to draw near to Me, even though its sins be as scarlet.\n\ndoc2397461: Divine Mercy Sunday. Souls perish in spite of My bitter Passion. I am giving them the last hope of salvation; that is, the Feast of My Mercy. If they will not adore My mercy, they will perish for all eternity\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 tell souls about this great mercy of Mine, because the awful day, the day of My justice, is near.\n\ndoc24210: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. These souls cause Me more suffering than any others; it was from such souls that My soul felt the most revulsion in the Garden of Olives. It was on their account that I said: \"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass Me by.\" The last hope of salvation for them is to flee to My Mercy.\"[16]\n\ndoc2397481: Divine Mercy Sunday. ...in both cases, adding a devout prayer to the Merciful Lord (i.e. \"Merciful Jesus, I trust in You.\").\n\ndoc2397464: Divine Mercy Sunday. Yes, the first Sunday after Easter is the Feast of Mercy, but there must also be deeds of mercy, which are to arise out of love for Me. You are to show mercy to our neighbors always and everywhere. You must not shrink from this or try to absolve yourself from it.\n\ndoc24194: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.[14]\n\ndoc1353821: Works of mercy. Pope John Paul II issued a papal encyclical \"Dives in misericordia\" on 30 November 1980 declaring that \"Jesus Christ taught that man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but that he is also called \"to practice mercy\" towards others.[4] Another notable devotion associated with the works of mercy is the Divine Mercy, which are reputed to be apparitions of Jesus Christ to Saint Faustina Kowalska.\n\ndoc2397469: Divine Mercy Sunday. On March 23, 1937, Faustyna wrote in her diary (Notebook III, item 1044) that she had a vision that the feast of Divine Mercy would be celebrated in her local chapel, and would be attended by large crowds, and that the same celebration would be held in Rome attended by the Pope.[4][6] She wrote: \"The crowd was so enormous that the eye could not take it all in. Everyone was participating in the celebrations.\"[4]\n\ndoc1353823: Works of mercy. In particular cases, a given individual will not be obligated or even competent to perform four of the spiritual works of mercy, namely: instructing the ignorant, counseling the doubtful, admonishing sinners, and comforting the afflicted. These works may require a definitely superior level of authority or knowledge or an extraordinary amount of tact. The other works of mercy, however, are considered to be an obligation of all faithful to practise unconditionally.[11] In an address on the 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation, Pope Francis suggested \"care for creation\" as a new work of mercy. Corporally, it means simple daily gestures of peace and love; spiritually, it means contemplation of the world.[12]\n\ndoc1016756: Dua. Once a man said, \"O God, forgive me and have mercy and have mercy on me!\" This was after the man had finished two raka'ats. Prophet Muhammad said, \"You have been hasty, O worshipper! When you finish your prayer, then sit down and praise God with the praise that he is worthy of, and recite durood upon me, then state your du'a...\"[25]\n\ndoc2397471: Divine Mercy Sunday. The first Mass during which the Divine Mercy image was displayed was on April 28, 1935, the first Sunday after Easter (the Feast of Divine Mercy) and was attended by Sr. Faustyna. (Diary of St. Faustyna, item 420).[12] April 28, 1935 was also the celebration of the end of the Jubilee of the Redemption by Pope Pius XI.[12][13] Father Michael Sopocko (Faustyna's confessor) celebrated the Mass that Sunday and obtained permission to place the image within the Gate of Dawn church in Vilnius during the Mass.[12][14]\n\ndoc599181: National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts). Pilgrims began to arrive the very next spring to celebrate the Feast of The Divine Mercy (just after Easter). By the end of World War II in 1945, pilgrims in growing numbers came to offer thanksgiving for graces received through the Divine Mercy message and devotion. They urged the Marians to build a shrine to Jesus, The Divine Mercy, as a votive of thanks. The Fathers decided to accede to the requests since there was also a need for a larger chapel to accommodate a growing community.\n\ndoc1136862: Mass (liturgy). The priest enters, with a deacon, if there is one, and altar servers (who may act as crucifer, torch-bearers and thurifer). After making the sign of the cross and greeting the people liturgically, he begins the Act of Penitence. This concludes with the priest's prayer of absolution, \"which, however, lacks the efficacy of the Sacrament of Penance\".[19] The Kyrie, eleison (Lord, have mercy), is sung or said,[20] followed by the Gloria in excelsis Deo (Glory to God in the highest), an ancient praise, if appropriate for the liturgical season.[21] The Introductory Rites are brought to a close by the Collect Prayer.\n\ndoc1063822: Good Friday. In addition to the prescribed liturgical service, the Stations of the Cross are often prayed either in the church or outside, and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00\u00c2\u00a0pm, known as the Three Hours' Agony. In countries such as Malta, Italy, Philippines, Puerto Rico and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2597457: May God have mercy upon your soul. Depending on where it is used, the phrase has had different emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer for the soul of the condemned.[2][3] However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it has only been said as a result of legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.[4]\n\ndoc1792155: Amidah. On public fast days, special prayers for mercy are added to the Amidah. At Shacharit, no changes are made in the silent Amidah, but the chazzan adds an additional blessing in his repetition right after the blessing of Geulah, known by its first word Aneinu (\"Answer us\"). The blessing concludes with the signature \"Blessed are You, O Lord, Who responds (some say: to His nation Israel) in time of trouble.\"\n\ndoc1010824: Liturgical year. By a decree of May 5, 2000, the Second Sunday of Easter (the Sunday after Easter Day itself), is known also in the Roman Rite as the Feast of the Divine Mercy.[39]\n\ndoc2397459: Divine Mercy Sunday. I want the image solemnly blessed on the first Sunday after Easter, and I want it to be venerated publicly so that every soul may know about it.\n\ndoc509835: Trisagion. In the Latin Church, the Trisagion is also employed in the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin. There is also a Chaplet to the Holy Trinity used by the Order of the Most Holy Trinity called 'The Trisagion' or the 'Angelic Trisagion', which makes use of both forms of the Trisagion.[1] It is also used in the hour of Prime, in the ferial Preces, on ferias of Advent and Lent and on common Vigils.\n\ndoc1085758: Beatitudes. In Christian teachings, the Works of Mercy, which have corporal and spiritual components, have resonated with the theme of the Beatitude for mercy.[14] These teachings emphasize that these acts of mercy provide both temporal and spiritual benefits.[1][8] The theme of mercy has continued in devotions such as the Divine Mercy in the 20th century.[15]\n\ndoc161036: Sacrament of Penance. \"God, the Father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his Son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins. Through the ministry of the Church may God give you pardon and peace. And I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\"[43][42][b]\n\ndoc1072049: Pope Francis. With his April 2015 papal bull of indiction, Misericordiae Vultus (Latin: \"The Face of Mercy\"), Francis inaugurated a Special Jubilee Year of Mercy, to run from 8 December 2015, Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to the last Sunday before Advent and the Solemnity of the Feast of Christ the King of the Universe on 20 November 2016.\n\ndoc2397483: Divine Mercy Sunday. Even if the above is impossible to do, the Indulgence is granted if with spiritual intention they unite themselves to the ones carrying on the prescribed practices with the intention of fulfilling the requirements as soon as it is possible.\n\ndoc1063825: Good Friday. The Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as acts of reparation for the sufferings and insults that Jesus suffered during his Passion on Good Friday. These Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the Raccolta Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the Holy See in 1898) which also includes prayers as Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary.[36][37][38][39]\n\ndoc2441012: Confiteor. Outside of Mass some prayers similar to the Confiteor appear earlier. The \"Canonical Rule\" of Chrodegang of Metz (d. 743) recommends: \"First of all prostrate yourself humbly in the sight of God ... and pray Blessed Mary with the holy Apostles and Martyrs and Confessors to pray to the Lord for you.\" And Ecgbert of York (d. 766) gives a short form that is the germ of our present prayer: \"Say to him to whom you wish to confess your sins: through my fault that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed.\" In answer the confessor says almost exactly the Misereatur.[1]\n\ndoc87359: Priesthood in the Catholic Church. Bishop: Do you resolve to implore with us God's mercy upon the people entrusted to your care by observing the command to pray without ceasing?\n\ndoc1072058: Pope Francis. Pope Francis said that the most powerful message of Jesus Christ is mercy.[263] His motto, Miserando atque eligendo, is about Jesus's mercy towards sinners. The phrase is taken from a homily of Saint Bede, who commented that Jesus \"saw the tax collector and, because he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him, he said to him: 'Follow me'\".[e][49] The motto is a reference to the moment when he found his vocation to the priesthood, at the age of 17. He started a day of student celebrations by going to confession.[264]\n\ndoc554946: Parable of the Prodigal Son. In his 1984 apostolic exhortation titled Reconciliatio et paenitentia (Latin for Reconciliation and Penance), Pope John Paul II used this parable to explain the process of conversion and reconciliation. Emphasizing that God the Father is \"rich in mercy\" and always ready to forgive, he stated that reconciliation is a gift on his part. He stated that for the Church her \"mission of reconciliation is the initiative, full of compassionate love and mercy, of that God who is love.\"[10][11] He also explored the issues raised by this parable in his second encyclical Dives in misericordia (Latin for Rich in Mercy) issued in 1980.[12]\n\ndoc1745415: Patronage. The liturgical feast of the Patronage of Our Lady was first permitted by Decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on 6 May 1679, for all the ecclesiastical provinces of Spain, in memory of the victories obtained over the Saracens, heretics and other enemies from the sixth century to the reign of Philip IV of Spain. Pope Benedict XII ordered it to be kept in the Papal States on the third Sunday of November. To other places it is granted, on request, for some Sunday in November, to be designated by the ordinary. In many places the feast of the Patronage is held with an additional Marian title of Queen of All Saints, of Mercy, Mother of Graces. The Office is taken entirely from the Common of the Blessed Virgin, and the Mass is the \"Salve sancta parens\".[6]\n\ndoc2597460: May God have mercy upon your soul. The sentence of this court is that you will be taken from here to the place from whence you came and there be kept in close confinement until [date of execution], and upon that day that you be taken to the place of execution and there hanged by the neck until you are dead. And may God have mercy upon your soul.\n\ndoc974425: Blasphemy. In the Catholic Church, there are specific prayers and devotions as Acts of Reparation for blasphemy.[25] For instance, The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer) first introduced by Sister Marie of St Peter in 1844 is recited \"in a spirit of reparation for blasphemy\". This devotion (started by Sister Marie and then promoted by the Venerable Leo Dupont) was approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885.[26] The Raccoltabook includes a number of such prayers.[27] The Five First Saturdays devotions are done with the intention in the heart of making reparation to the Blessed Mother for blasphemies against her, her name and her holy initiatives.\n\ndoc1072050: Pope Francis. The Holy Doors of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special \"Doors of Mercy\" were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world, where the faithful can earn indulgences by fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the Pope's intentions, confession, and detachment from sin, and communion.[227] During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services will be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called \"Missionaries of Mercy\" will be available in every diocese to forgive even severe, special-case sins normally reserved to the Holy See's Apostolic Penitentiary.[228][229]\n\ndoc2260209: Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. They must not be recited by only one person in prayer, but by an entire congregation, which must consist of at least ten persons, a minyan.[4]\n\ndoc634873: Pharisee and the Publican. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the parable is read as part of the preparatory period leading up to Great Lent. It provides an example of the humility which should be practised during the Lenten period. The Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee begins the three-week pre-Lenten Season and the first use of the liturgical Triodion (although the week following this Sunday is fast-free).[3] This Sunday includes a hymn inspired by the parable:\n\ndoc490644: Pentecost. An extraordinary service called the \"Kneeling Prayer\" is observed on the night of Pentecost. This is a Vespers service to which are added three sets of long poetical prayers, the composition of Saint Basil the Great, during which everyone makes a full prostration, touching their foreheads to the floor (prostrations in church having been forbidden from the day of Pascha (Easter) up to this point).  Uniquely, these prayers include a petition for all of those in hell, that they may be granted relief and even ultimate release from their confinement, if God deems this possible.[27]\n\ndoc2624812: Yom Tov Torah readings. When Shabbat occurs on Chol Hamoed of either Sukkot or Passover, Exodus 33:12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c34:26 is read.[27] Since this is on Shabbat, it is always divided into seven readings. This reading contains the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. The individual readings are listed with the readings for Passover and Sukkot.\n\ndoc12933: Lord's Prayer. \"And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us;\"\n\ndoc1024752: Holy Week. On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection.\nThe Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare, until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes for paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.[27]\n\ndoc1072060: Pope Francis. In March 2015, Pope Francis announced that the universal church would celebrate a Jubilee Year from 8 December 2015 to 20 November 2016, dedicated to the theme of God's mercy. The Vatican announced the pope would perform several acts to demonstrate the theme of God's mercy.[270]\n\ndoc1024812: Holy Week. Since the liturgical day starts from the evening before a calendar day, the prayers of Palm Sunday begin on the evening of Lazarus' Saturday.\n\ndoc2289152: Repentance in Islam. The use of the verse \"In the name of Allah, the Benevolent, the Merciful\" at the beginning of every sura (except one) further testifies to this fact. According to the narration of Quran and Hadith, Allah's overarching mercy permits even the gravest sins to be pardoned by Him, provided the wrongdoer intends a sincere tawba. Allah says:\n\ndoc2142991: Prayer in the Catholic Church. Thankfulness is thanking God for what he has given and done.[18]\n\ndoc582515: Rosary. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a0 Note: It is customary to pray only the Sorrowful Mysteries during the seasons of Septuagesima and Lent, regardless of the day of week.\n\ndoc2260205: Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. According to the explanation of Maimonides these attributes must not be regarded as qualities inherent in God, but as the method of His activity, by which the divine governance appears to the human observer to be controlled.[1] In the Sifre, however, these attributes are not called \"middot\", which may mean \"quality\" as well as \"rule\" and \"measure\", but \"derakim\" (ways), since they are the ways of God which Moses prayed to know and which God proclaimed to him.\n\ndoc1442902: Hanukkah. The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) (Psalms 113 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Psalms 118) are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[94][96]\n\ndoc1954515: The Mercy Seat (song). This section is repeated fifteen times during the course of the song, with a number of variations in the text. Specific allusions to scripture include those to Leviticus 16:11\u201319 and Leviticus 24:19\u201321.[2]\n\ndoc1063809: Good Friday. May Christ our true God, Who for the salvation of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother, of our holy and God-bearing fathers, and of all the saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind.\n\ndoc1024803: Holy Week. Vespers joined to the Divine Liturgy is served on Great and Holy Saturday, prescribed by the Liturgical books to be served in the afternoon but often served in the morning. This is the Proti Anastasi (First Resurrection) service, commemorating the Harrowing of Hell. Just before the reading of the Gospel, the hangings and vestments and changed from dark lenten colors to white, and the entire mood of the service changes from mourning to joy. However, the faithful do not yet greet one another with the Paschal kiss, since the Resurrection has not yet been announced to the living.\n\ndoc1212397: Eastertide. Since 2000 the Second Sunday of Easter is also called Divine Mercy Sunday. The name \"Low Sunday\" for this Sunday, once common in English, is now rarely used.\n\ndoc2597456: May God have mercy upon your soul. \"May God have mercy upon your soul\" or \"may God have mercy on your soul\" is a phrase used within courts in various legal systems by judges pronouncing a sentence of death upon a person found guilty of a crime that requires a death sentence. The phrase originated in beth din courts in the Kingdom of Israel as a way to attribute God as the highest authority in law.[1] The usage of the phrase later spread to England and Wales' legal system and from there to usage throughout the colonies of the British Empire whenever a death sentence was passed.\n\ndoc1010787: Liturgical year. The Book of Common Prayer contains within it the traditional Western Eucharistic lectionary which traces its roots to the Comes of St. Jerome in the 5th century.[12] Its similarity to the ancient lectionary is particularly obvious during Trinity season (Sundays after the Sunday after Pentecost), reflecting that understanding of sanctification.[13]\n\ndoc2107747: God in Islam. His mercy takes many forms from as he say in the Quran \"and My Mercy embraces all things.\u201d [7:156] this is shown by a in Muslim narrated from Abu Hurairah said the Prophet said\u00a0: \u201cAllah has one hundred parts of mercy, of which He sent down one between the jinn, mankind, the animals and the insects, by means of which they are compassionate and merciful to one another, and by means of which wild animals are kind to their offspring. And Allah has kept back ninety-nine parts of mercy with which to be merciful to His slaves of the Day of Resurrection.\u201d[34][35] Also God's mercy according to Islamic theology is what gets a person into paradise. According to Hadith in Shahih Al Bukhari \u201cNo one\u2019s deeds will ever admit him to Paradise.\u201d They said, \u201cNot even you, O Messenger of Allah?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, not even me, unless Allah showers me with His Mercy. So try to be near to perfection. And no one should wish for death; he is either doing good so he will do more of that, or he is doing wrong so he may repent.\u201d[35][36]\n\ndoc884708: Holy day of obligation. (See Liturgy Office)\n\ndoc1353822: Works of mercy. Based on Jesus' doctrine of the sheep and the goats, the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a means of grace as good deeds[5] and their omission is a reason for damnation.[6] Because the Messianic Age will be a time of mercy,[7] and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming[8] and believes Jesus obeyed every mitzvah and fulfilled the Scriptures,[9] Catholics perform the works of mercy.[10]\n\n"
