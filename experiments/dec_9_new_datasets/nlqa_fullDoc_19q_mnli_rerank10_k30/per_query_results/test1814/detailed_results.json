Following the recalls, 51 people reported adverse effects to the FDA; these reports were reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to StarLink.[32] The CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence the reactions these people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the StarLink Bt protein.[33]\n\ndoc63827: StarLink corn recall. The EPA was criticized by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety, who said \"Clearly they didn't do anything here until they became embarrassed.\"[34] The EPA and Aventis were also criticized for statements at the time of the recall that indicated they had no idea such a thing would happen.[35] \"If there has been a violation of our licensing process, then we would have a very great concern,\" was attributed to Stephen Johnson of the EPA. Margaret Gadsby of Aventis was quoted with her earlier statement \"We have difficulty imagining how our corn could end up in the human food supply.\"\n\ndoc63825: StarLink corn recall. It was estimated that due to grain mixing StarLink corn could have existed in more than 50% of the US corn supply[2] and that overall, the StarLink incident depressed the price of US corn about 7% for about a year.[31]:533\n\ndoc63823: StarLink corn recall. On October 26, 2000 StarLink corn was reported to be found in Japan and South Korea.[4]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 The market and distribution network for corn in the US was thrown into disarray through 2001, as there were no existing means to segregate the grain;[23][24] the disarray eventually eased due to the Aventis' testing and buyback program discussed below.[25]\n\ndoc63828: StarLink corn recall. The registration for the StarLink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[36]:7 In February 2001, it was announced that the president, general counsel, and vice president of market development for Aventis CropScience (US), had been fired in response to the recall.[37]\n\ndoc63835: StarLink corn recall. The US corn supply was monitored by the Federal Grain Inspection Service for the presence of the StarLink Bt proteins from 2001 until 2010.[45][46]\n\ndoc63831: StarLink corn recall. In 2002, Aventis, Garst, Kraft Foods, Azteca Foods, Azteca Milling, and Mission Foods settled a lawsuit brought by two people, and the grandmother of a third, who claimed to have had allergic reactions to StarLink, for $9 million.[41]\n\ndoc1902253: Genetically modified maize. StarLink corn was subsequently found in food destined for consumption by humans in the US, Japan, and South Korea.[99]:20\u201321 This corn became the subject of the widely publicized Starlink corn recall, which started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain the corn. Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued.[102][103] The registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000. (Pioneer had been bought by AgrEvo which then became Aventis CropScience at the time of the incident,[99]:15\u201316 which was later bought by Bayer[104]\n\ndoc63824: StarLink corn recall. In January 2001 under a written agreement with 17 US states,[26] Aventis initiated a program called the StarLink Enhanced Stewardship (SES) program, under which StarLink corn, buffer corn, and any corn stored in grain elevators that had become mixed with StarLink, would be bought by Aventis and directed to animal feed and non-food industrial use (e.g. ethanol production); the program included free kits to test for StarLink, and covered costs of cleaning equipment, transport, and storage facilities, as well as increased transportation costs.[27]:193\u00e2\u20ac\u201c95 Aventis estimated the cost would be between $100 million to $1 billion.[28][29][30]\n\ndoc63836: StarLink corn recall. In August 2013, StarLink corn was reported to be found again contaminating some foods in Saudi Arabia.[47]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc63832: StarLink corn recall. In 2002, nongovernmental organizations claimed that aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.[42]:96\n\ndoc1902256: Genetically modified maize. The US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001.[108]\n\ndoc1902254: Genetically modified maize. Fifty-one people reported adverse effects to the FDA; US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to Starlink.[105] However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.[106]\n\ndoc63817: StarLink corn recall. StarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing two modifications: a gene for resistance to glufosinate, and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein called Cry9C.[2] Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink, causing heightened regulatory scrutiny.[3] StarLink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems, which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident,[4]:15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply.[4]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[5]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed only.[3][6] StarLink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998. After the incident the company at first tried to get the application for human consumption approved, and then withdrew the product entirely from the market.[4]:15\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000. She also stated that food safety and legal compliance were Kraft's main priority.[18]\n\ndoc63822: StarLink corn recall. Safeway later announced it would recall its store brand taco shells at the recommendation of a consumer group on October 12, 2000. This was done as a precaution, and no StarLink was confirmed to be found in any of the products[19] On October 13 and 14, Mission Foods voluntary recalled about 300 products.[20][21] On October 22, 2000 it was reported that Kellogg's had shut down a plant as a precaution because they couldn't guarantee that StarLink corn flour had not been supplied to the plant.[22]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc63818: StarLink corn recall. The Garst Seed Company (part of the Advanta group) was licensed by Aventis to produce and sell StarLink seed in the US.[7]:8\n\ndoc1902216: Genetically modified maize. Genetically modified maize (corn) is a genetically modified crop. Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits, including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow. One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000.\n\ndoc2393539: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2001, when the Starlink corn recall became public, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was criticized for being slow to react by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety.[480] He also criticized the EPA and Aventis CropScience for statements at the time of the recall, that indicated they did not anticipate that such a thing would happen.[480]\n\ndoc63830: StarLink corn recall. In September 2001, a group of about 5,000 Taco Bell franchisees and a handful of taco shell suppliers brought a class-action lawsuit against Aventis, Garst Seed Co.; Gruma Corp., (\"the largest producer and distributor of corn flour and tortillas in the United States; and Azteca Milling seeking damages.[39] This suit was voluntarily dismissed in December 2001.[40]:65\n\ndoc243568: Dietary fiber. One insoluble fiber, resistant starch from high-amylose corn, has been used as a supplement and may contribute to improving insulin sensitivity and glycemic management[24][25][26] as well as promoting regularity[27] and possibly relief of diarrhea.[28][29][30] One preliminary finding indicates that resistant corn starch may reduce symptoms of ulcerative colitis.[31]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc1902257: Genetically modified maize. In 2005, aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.[109]\n\ndoc1902252: Genetically modified maize. StarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop.[98] Starlink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food.[99]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[100]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed.[98][101] Starlink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998.[99]:15\n\ndoc1459267: Maize. Maize is a major source of starch. Cornstarch (maize flour) is a major ingredient in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also a major source of cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.\n\ndoc1159953: Corn production in the United States. The subsidies have been criticized for:\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc1698877: Sweet corn. Sweet corn (Zea mays convar. saccharata var. rugosa;[1] also called sugar corn and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy.\n\ndoc1459231: Maize. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc1459271: Maize. Starch from maize can also be made into plastics, fabrics, adhesives, and many other chemical products.\n\ndoc1954259: Pellagra. The whole dried corn kernel contains a nutritious germ and a thin seed coat that provides some fiber. [46] There are two important considerations for using ground whole-grain corn.\n\ndoc132522: Food security. Corn, a pillar of American agriculture for years, is now mainly used for ethanol, high fructose corn syrup and bio-based plastics.[110] About 40 percent of corn is used for ethanol and 36% is used as animal feed.[110] Only a tiny fraction of corn is used as a food source, much of that fraction is used for high-fructose corn syrup, which is a main ingredient in processed, unhealthy junk food.[110]\n\ndoc63819: StarLink corn recall. In 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert was launched by seven organizations (Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Environmental Trust, Organic Consumers Association, Pesticide Action Network North America, and The State PIRGs) to lobby the FDA, Congress and companies to ban or stop using GMOs.[8][9][10] One of their activities was testing food for the presence of GMOs via a lab called Genetic ID, the vice president of which was Jeffrey M. Smith.[11][12]\n\ndoc63829: StarLink corn recall. In June 2001 Tricon Global Restaurants, 20% owners of Taco Bell at the time, announced a $60 million settlement with some of the suppliers of the supermarket taco shells; under the terms of the settlement they could not disclose the identity of suppliers.[38] Tricon stated that the settlement would go to Taco Bell franchisees and Tricon would not receive any of it. Tricon also announced that it, along with the suppliers and franchisees, would initiate litigation against the parties responsible for StarLink entering the food chain.\n\ndoc63820: StarLink corn recall. On September 18, 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert released a statement that Genetic ID had conducted tests on \"Taco Bell Home Originals\" brand taco shells, made by Kraft Foods that had been purchased in a grocery store near Washington, DC, and had detected StarLink;[13] the story was reported on by The Washington Post.[4]:15[12] Kraft distributed the Taco Bell-branded taco shells under a 1996 license agreement with Taco Bell.[14]:54\n\ndoc1459187: Maize. Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing that of wheat or rice. However, not all of this maize is consumed directly by humans. Some of the maize production is used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.[2]\n\ndoc976701: Genetically modified food. Corn used for food and ethanol has been genetically modified to tolerate various herbicides and to express a protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that kills certain insects.[67] About 90% of the corn grown in the US was genetically modified in 2010.[68] In the US in 2015, 81% of corn acreage contained the Bt trait and 89% of corn acreage contained the glyphosate-tolerant trait.[43] Corn can be processed into grits, meal and flour as an ingredient in pancakes, muffins, doughnuts, breadings and batters, as well as baby foods, meat products, cereals and some fermented products. Corn-based masa flour and masa dough are used in the production of taco shells, corn chips and tortillas.[69]\n\ndoc1377423: Taco Bell. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of Taco Bell-branded shells were recalled from supermarkets. The shells contained a variety of genetically modified corn called StarLink that was not approved for human consumption. StarLink was approved only for use in animal feed because of questions about whether it can cause allergic reactions in people.[15] It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type.[16] In 2001, Tricon Global announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.[17]\n\ndoc1460180: Genetically modified crops. Many strains of corn have been developed in recent years to combat the spread of Maize dwarf mosaic virus, a costly virus that causes stunted growth which is carried in Johnson grass and spread by aphid insect vectors. These strands are commercially available although the resistance is not standard among GM corn variants.[152]\n\ndoc634858: Starch. Resistant starch is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals. High amylose starch from corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than other types of starch and retains its resistant starch content through baking, mild extrusion and other food processing techniques. It is used as an insoluble dietary fiber in processed foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, pretzels and other low moisture foods. It is also utilized as a dietary supplement for its health benefits. Published studies have shown that resistant starch helps to improve insulin sensitivity,[39] increases satiety[40] and improves markers of colonic function.[41] It has been suggested that resistant starch contributes to the health benefits of intact whole grains.[42]\n\ndoc1698890: Sweet corn. Early cultivars, including those used by Native Americans, were the result of the mutant su (\"sugary\") allele.[2] They contain about 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10% sugar by weight.\n\ndoc2116622: Pringles. Pringles also produces several \"multi-grain\" varieties which have some of their base starch ingredients replaced with corn flour, rice, wheat bran, black beans,[26] and barley flour.[27]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc1698891: Sweet corn. Supersweet corn are cultivars of sweet corn which produce higher than normal levels of sugar developed by University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign professor John Laughnan.[4] He was investigating two specific genes in sweet corn, one of which, the sh2 gene, caused the corn to shrivel when dry. After further investigation Laughnan discovered that the endosperm of sh2 sweet corn kernels store less starch and from 4 to 10 times more sugar than normal su sweet corn. He published his findings in 1953, disclosing the advantages of growing supersweet sweet corn, but many corn breeders lacked enthusiasm for the new supersweet corn. Illinois Foundation Seeds Inc. was the first seed company to release a supersweet corn and it was called 'Illini Xtra Sweet', but widespread use of supersweet hybrids did not occur until the early 1980s. The popularity of supersweet corn rose due to its long shelf life and large sugar content when compared to conventional sweet corn. This has allowed the long-distance shipping of sweet corn and has enabled manufacturers to can sweet corn without adding extra sugar or salt.\n\ndoc2119412: Corn flakes. Dr. Kellogg introduced Kellogg's Corn Flakes in hopes that it would reduce dyspepsia and, in accordance with the practices of the Seventh-day Adventists, masturbation and excessive sexual intercourse.[7]\n\ndoc1299056: Insulin resistance. Resistant starch from high-amylose corn, amylomaize, has been shown to reduce insulin resistance in healthy individuals, in individuals with insulin resistance, and in individuals with type 2 diabetes.[98] Animal studies demonstrate that it cannot reverse damage already done by high glucose levels, but that it reduces insulin resistance and reduces the development of further damage.[99][100][101]\n\ndoc720310: Corn ethanol. The gluten protein is dried and filtered to make a corn gluten- meals co-product and is highly sought after by poultry broiler operators as a feed ingredient. The steeping liquor produced is concentrated and dried with the fiber and sold as corn gluten feed to in the livestock industry. The heavy steep water is also sold as a feed ingredient and is used as an environmentally friendly alternative to salt in the winter months. The corn starch and remaining water can then be processed one of three ways: 1) fermented into ethanol, through a similar process as dry milling, 2) dried and sold as modified corn starch, or 3) made into corn syrup.\n\ndoc2669824: Corn nut. A popular variety of cornick is the lighter, chicharr\u00f3n-like chichacorn,[7] a semi-popped style of cornick using glutinous corn from the Ilocos Region[8] which is treated with lime before frying.[9]\n\ndoc1672455: Corn on the cob. Corn on the cob (known regionally as \"pole corn\", \"corn stick\", \"sweet pole\", \"butter-pop\" or \"long maize\")[citation needed]  is a culinary term used for a cooked ear of freshly picked maize from a cultivar of sweet corn. Sweet corn is the most common variety of maize eaten directly off the cob.[1] The ear is picked while the endosperm is in the \"milk stage\" so that the kernels are still tender. Ears of corn are steamed or boiled, usually without their green husks, or roasted with them. The husk leaves are in any case removed before serving.\n\ndoc1159949: Corn production in the United States. See also US Agricultural subsidies\n\ndoc1258897: Combine harvester. While a grain platform can be used for corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with snap rolls that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically, since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row.\n\ndoc2548966: Glucose syrup. The starch needs to be swelled to allow the enzymes or acid to act upon it. When grain is used, sulfur dioxide is added to prevent spoilage.\n\ndoc1159942: Corn production in the United States. The total production of corn in the US for the year 2013-14 is reported to be 13.016 billion bushels of which the major use is for manufacture of ethanol and its co-product (Distillers' Dried Grains with Solubles) accounting for 37% (27% + 10%) or 4,845 million bushels (3,552 + 1,293). The other uses are given in the table.[6]\n\ndoc720318: Corn ethanol. The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), the ethanol industry's lobby group, claims that ethanol production does increase the price of corn by increasing demand. The RFA claims that ethanol production has positive economic effect for US farmers, but it does not elaborate on the effect for other populations where field corn is part of the staple diet. An RFA lobby document states that \"In a January 2007 statement, the USDA Chief Economist stated that farm program payments were expected to be reduced by some $6 billion due to the higher value of a bushel of corn.[16]\n\ndoc1698893: Sweet corn. All of the alleles responsible for sweet corn are recessive, so it must be isolated from other corn, such as field corn and popcorn, that release pollen at the same time; the endosperm develops from genes from both parents, and heterozygous kernels will be tough and starchy. The se and su alleles do not need to be isolated from each other. However supersweet cultivars containing the sh2 allele must be grown in isolation from other cultivars to avoid cross-pollination and resulting starchiness, either in space (various sources quote minimum quarantine distances from 100 to 400 feet or 30 to 120 m) or in time (i.e., the supersweet corn does not pollinate at the same time as other corn in nearby fields).\n\ndoc2548965: Glucose syrup. Before conversion of starch to glucose can begin, the starch must be separated from the plant material. This includes removing fibre and protein (which can be valuable by-products, for example wheat or maize gluten[1]p.\u00c2\u00a022). Protein produces off-flavours and colours due to the Maillard reaction, and fibre is insoluble and has to be removed to allow the starch to become hydrated. The plant material also needs to be ground as part of this process to expose the starch to the water.\n\ndoc720313: Corn ethanol. Since most U.S. ethanol is produced from corn and the required electricity from many distilleries comes mainly from coal plants, there has been considerable debate on the sustainability of corn-based bio-ethanol in replacing fossil fuels. Controversy and concerns relate to the large amount of arable land required for crops and its impact on grain supply, direct and indirect land use change effects, as well as issues regarding its energy balance and carbon intensity considering the full life cycle of ethanol production, and also issues regarding water use and pollution due to the increase expansion of ethanol production.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]\n\ndoc2032743: Callus. The hard part at the center of the corn resembles a funnel with a broad raised top and a pointed bottom. Because of their shape, corns intensify the pressure at the tip and can cause deep tissue damage and ulceration.[2] The scientific name for a corn is heloma (plural helomata). A hard corn is called a heloma durum, while a soft corn is called a heloma molle.\n\ndoc65066: Popcorn. Some strains of corn (taxonomized as Zea mays) are cultivated specifically as popping corns. The Zea mays variety everta, a special kind of flint corn, is the most common of these.\n\ndoc1698881: Sweet corn. There are currently hundreds of cultivars, with more constantly being developed.\n\ndoc1459219: Maize. Many forms of maize are used for food, sometimes classified as various subspecies related to the amount of starch each has:\n\ndoc1175102: Resistant starch. Isolated and extracted resistant starch and foods rich in resistant starch have been used to fortify foods to increase their dietary fiber content.[27][38][44] Typically, food fortification utilizes RS2 resistant starch from high amylose corn, RS3 resistant starch from cassava and RS4 resistant starch from wheat and potato, as these sources can survive varying degrees of food processing without losing their resistant starch content.[8]\n\ndoc1698887: Sweet corn. If left to dry on the plant, kernels may be taken off the cob and cooked in oil where, unlike popcorn, they expand to about double the original kernel size and are often called corn nuts. A soup may also be made from the plant, called sweet corn soup.\n\ndoc2068179: Glucose. Glucose is produced commercially via the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch. Many crops can be used as the source of starch. Maize, rice, wheat, cassava, corn husk and sago are all used in various parts of the world. In the United States, corn starch (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Most commercial glucose occurs as a component of invert sugar, a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolysed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical.[26] Glucose syrup, also known as corn syrup, is essentially a purified aqueous solution of saccharides obtained from edible starch that has a dextrose equivalency (DE) of 20 or more. Dried corn syrup is glucose syrup with the water removed. Glucose has a DE of 100; dried maltodextrin has a DE of less than 20. Corn syrup has a DE between 20 and 95.[29]\n\ndoc1672457: Corn on the cob. Within a day of corn being picked it starts converting sugar into starch, which results in reduction in the level of natural sweetness. Corn should be cooked and served the same day it has been harvested, as it takes only a single day for corn to lose up to 25% of its sweetness.[2]\n\ndoc2580838: Corn syrup. Corn syrup is a food syrup which is made from the starch of corn (called maize in some countries) and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade. Corn syrup, also known as glucose syrup to confectioners, is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose.\n\ndoc720314: Corn ethanol. The U.S. Department of Energy has published facts stating that current corn-based ethanol results in a 19% reduction in greenhouse gases, and is better for the environment than other gasoline additives such as MTBE.[14]\n\ndoc1315436: List of maize dishes. Pudding corn is prepared from stewed corn, water, any of various thickening agents, and optional additional flavoring or texturing ingredients\n\ndoc2055305: Keratoconus. Corneal collagen cross-linking is a developing treatment which aims to strengthen the cornea, however, according to a 2015 Cochrane review, there is insufficient evidence to determine if it is useful in keratoconus.[60]\n\ndoc1159952: Corn production in the United States. In 2014, the \"direct payments\" portion of subsidies was abolished, and subsidies were mostly replaced with two programs. Farmers may pick Price Loss Coverage (a guarantee that the farmer will get a certain price for their crop) and Agricultural Risk Coverage (which guarantees a certain amount of revenue).[16][15]\n\ndoc1159950: Corn production in the United States. Corn in the United States has been subsidized since the 1930s, when a drop in demand from post-war Europe caused a food glut and prices crashed. In the 1980s, subsidies increased substantially.[15]\n\ndoc516371: High-fructose corn syrup. Since 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared HFCS to be safe as a food ingredient.[5] In 2015, production of HFCS in the United States was 8.5 million tons from some 500 million bushels of corn.[55]\n\ndoc1902217: Genetically modified maize. Corn varieties resistant to glyphosate herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by Monsanto, and are known as \"Roundup Ready Corn\". They tolerate the use of Roundup.[1] Bayer CropScience developed \"Liberty Link Corn\" that is resistant to glufosinate.[2] Pioneer Hi-Bred has developed and markets corn hybrids with tolerance to imidazoline herbicides under the trademark \"Clearfield\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though in these hybrids, the herbicide-tolerance trait was bred using tissue culture selection and the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate, not genetic engineering.[3] Consequently, the regulatory framework governing the approval of transgenic crops does not apply for Clearfield.[3]\n\ndoc2548958: Glucose syrup. Glucose syrup, also known as confectioner's glucose, is a syrup made from the hydrolysis of starch. Glucose is a sugar. Maize (corn) is commonly used as the source of the starch in the US, in which case the syrup is called \"corn syrup\", but glucose syrup is also made from potatoes and wheat, and less often from barley, rice and cassava.[1]p.\u00c2\u00a021[2]\n\ndoc707458: Beer. The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, able to be saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops.[49] A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley.[50] Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others.[51] The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.\n\ndoc1159944: Corn production in the United States. Two methods are used to produce ethanol from corn and other plants such as sugar cane. The residual product (DDGS) is about 33% of the input stream and is used as livestock feed. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to produce E10 and E85 fuels for automobile vehicles. Its manufacture has created 400,000 jobs in the US and its environmental friendliness is recorded in the form of reduced gas emissions of 25.3 million metric tons. One bushel of corn can produce 2.8 gallons of ethanol, 17.5\u00a0lbs of livestock feed and 18\u00a0lbs of carbon dioxide.[8]\n\ndoc65075: Popcorn. As the oil and the water within the kernel are heated, they turn the moisture in the kernel into pressurized steam. Under these conditions, the starch inside the kernel gelatinizes, softens, and becomes pliable. The internal pressure of the entrapped steam continues to increase until the breaking point of the hull is reached: a pressure of approximately 135\u00a0psi (930\u00a0kPa)[12] and a temperature of 180\u00a0\u00b0C (356\u00a0\u00b0F). The hull thereupon ruptures rapidly and actually explodes, causing a sudden drop in pressure inside the kernel and a corresponding rapid expansion of the steam, which expands the starch and proteins of the endosperm into airy foam. As the foam rapidly cools, the starch and protein polymers set into the familiar crispy puff.[12] Special varieties are grown to give improved popping yield. Though the kernels of some wild types will pop, the cultivated strain is Zea mays everta, which is a special kind of flint corn.\n\ndoc607369: Alpha-amylase. The first step in the production of high-fructose corn syrup is the treatment of cornstarch with \u00ce\u00b1-amylase, producing shorter chains of sugars oligosaccharides.\n\ndoc553720: Alternative energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has conducted various ethanol research projects, mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol.[113] Cellulosic ethanol has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol. It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood, grasses, or non-edible parts of plants.[114] Moreover, some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol.[115] Sandia National Laboratories conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research[116] and is also a member of the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI), a research institute founded by the United States Department of Energy with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels.[117]\n\ndoc469656: McDonald's. McDonald's has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that biodegradation is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.[115]\n\ndoc731326: Real Genius. In January, 2011, it was further demonstrated on video[15] in a home setting that a kernel of corn directly exposed to laser light from accessible consumer level lasers could be popped as reported by TechCrunch.[16]\n\ndoc2580841: Corn syrup. Corn syrup is produced from number 2 yellow dent corn.[7] When wet milled, about 2.3 litres of corn are required to yield an average of 947g of starch, to produce 1\u00a0kg of glucose or dextrose syrup. A bushel (25\u00a0kg) of corn will yield an average of 31.5 pounds (14.3\u00a0kg) of starch, which in turn will yield about 33.3 pounds (15.1\u00a0kg) of syrup. Thus, it takes about 2,300 litres of corn to produce a tonne of glucose syrup, or 60 bushels (1524\u00a0kg) of corn to produce one short ton.[8][9]\n\ndoc1460191: Genetically modified crops. high-fructose corn syrup\n\ndoc1460192: Genetically modified crops. high-fructose corn syrup\n\ndoc1460194: Genetically modified crops. high-fructose corn syrup\n\ndoc1902247: Genetically modified maize. In 2017, a large-scale study found \"pervasive presence of transgenes and glyphosate in maize-derived food in Mexico\"[88]\n\ndoc2313758: Ethanol fuel by country. U.S. corn-derived ethanol costs 30% more because the corn starch must first be converted to sugar before being distilled into alcohol. Despite this cost differential in production, in contrast to Japan and Sweden, the U.S. did not import much of Brazilian ethanol because of U.S. trade barriers corresponding to a tariff of 54-cent per gallon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a levy designed to offset the 45-cent per gallon blender's federal tax credit that was applied to ethanol no matter its country of origin.[5][108][109][110] In 2011 the U.S. Congress decided not to extend the tariff and the tax credit, and as a result both ended on December 31, 2011. Since 1980 the U.S. ethanol industry was awarded an estimated US$45 billion in subsidies.[111][112] One advantage U.S. corn-derived ethanol offers is the ability to return 1/3 of the feedstock back into the market as a replacement for the corn used in the form of Distillers Dried Grain.[21]\n\ndoc2513240: Biodegradable plastic. There is much debate about the total carbon, fossil fuel and water usage in manufacturing bioplastics from natural materials and whether they are a negative impact to human food supply. To make 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb) of polylactic acid, the most common commercially available compostable plastic, 2.65\u00a0kg (5.8\u00a0lb) of corn is required.[11] Since 270 million tonnes of plastic are made every year,[citation needed] replacing conventional plastic with corn-derived polylactic acid would remove 715.5 million tonnes from the world's food supply, at a time when global warming is reducing tropical farm productivity.[citation needed] \"Although U.S. corn is a highly productive crop, with typical yields between 140 and 160 bushels per acre, the resulting delivery of food by the corn system is far lower. Today\u2019s corn crop is mainly used for biofuels (roughly 40 percent of U.S. corn is used for ethanol) and as animal feed (roughly 36 percent of U.S. corn, plus distillers grains left over from ethanol production, is fed to cattle, pigs and chickens). Much of the rest is exported. Only a tiny fraction of the national corn crop is directly used for food for Americans, much of that for high fructose corn syrup.\"[12]\n\ndoc1175091: Resistant starch. In 2016, the U.S. FDA approved a qualified health claim stating that resistant starch might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but with qualifying language for product labels that limited scientific evidence exists to support this claim. Because qualified health claims are issued when the science evidence is weak or not consistent, the FDA requires specific labeling language, such as the guideline concerning resistant starch: \"High-amylose maize resistant starch may reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes. FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence for this claim.\"[20][21]\n\ndoc2626510: Aeroponics. According to Reese it is a historical feat to grow corn in an aeroponic apparatus for bio-massing. The university\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past attempts to grow all types of corn using hydroponics ended in failure.\n\ndoc1159951: Corn production in the United States. US subsidies for corn have averaged 4.7 billion dollars per year over the twenty years from 1995-2014 inclusive.[16] 2014 projections were that the US would spend $97.29 billion/year on farm and food programs over the next decade.[17]\n\ndoc2313732: Ethanol fuel by country. The production of fuel ethanol from corn in the United States is controversial for a few reasons. Production of ethanol from corn is 5 to 6 times less efficient than producing it from sugarcane. The reason that corn has been notoriously used for ethanol production is because farmers are either paid to destroy crops or to not grow corn crops. Another reason is that the cost of processing and transporting raw corn can be more expensive than transporting and processing it in to ethanol fuel. Corn production is highly dependent upon government subsidies, so naturally ethanol derived from corn is also highly dependent on government subsidies. Contrary to what most would claim, ethanol is not a food-versus-fuel issue.[45][46] Corn, along with other crops that have been distilled are still a usable food source for cattle. Known as dried distillers grains, it is proven to be significantly healthier and easier for cattle to digest.[47] On October 2008, the first \"biofuels corridor\" was officially opened along I-65, a major interstate highway in the central United States. Stretching from northern Indiana to southern Alabama, this corridor consisting of more than 200 individual fueling stations makes it possible to drive a flex-fueled vehicle from Lake Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico without being further than a quarter tank worth of fuel from an E85 pump.[48][49][50]\n\ndoc634848: Starch. The starch industry extracts and refines starches from seeds, roots and tubers, by wet grinding, washing, sieving and drying. Today, the main commercial refined starches are cornstarch, tapioca, arrowroot,[33] and wheat, rice, and potato starches. To a lesser extent, sources of refined starch are sweet potato, sago and mung bean. To this day, starch is extracted from more than 50 types of plants.\n\ndoc2580839: Corn syrup. The more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup, since glucose syrup is in the United States most commonly made from corn starch.[1][2] Technically, glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono-, di-, and higher-saccharides and can be made from any source of starch; wheat, tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources.[3][4][5]\n\ndoc1698880: Sweet corn. Sweet corn production in the 20th century was influenced by the following key developments:\n\ndoc1240406: 2007\u201308 world food price crisis. Nevertheless, supporters of ethanol claim that using corn for ethanol is not responsible for the worst food riots in the world, many of which have been caused by the price of rice and oil, which are not affected by biofuel use but rather by supply and demand.\n\n"

Following the recalls, 51 people reported adverse effects to the FDA; these reports were reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to StarLink.[32] The CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence the reactions these people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the StarLink Bt protein.[33]\n\ndoc63827: StarLink corn recall. The EPA was criticized by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety, who said \"Clearly they didn't do anything here until they became embarrassed.\"[34] The EPA and Aventis were also criticized for statements at the time of the recall that indicated they had no idea such a thing would happen.[35] \"If there has been a violation of our licensing process, then we would have a very great concern,\" was attributed to Stephen Johnson of the EPA. Margaret Gadsby of Aventis was quoted with her earlier statement \"We have difficulty imagining how our corn could end up in the human food supply.\"\n\ndoc63825: StarLink corn recall. It was estimated that due to grain mixing StarLink corn could have existed in more than 50% of the US corn supply[2] and that overall, the StarLink incident depressed the price of US corn about 7% for about a year.[31]:533\n\ndoc63823: StarLink corn recall. On October 26, 2000 StarLink corn was reported to be found in Japan and South Korea.[4]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 The market and distribution network for corn in the US was thrown into disarray through 2001, as there were no existing means to segregate the grain;[23][24] the disarray eventually eased due to the Aventis' testing and buyback program discussed below.[25]\n\ndoc63828: StarLink corn recall. The registration for the StarLink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[36]:7 In February 2001, it was announced that the president, general counsel, and vice president of market development for Aventis CropScience (US), had been fired in response to the recall.[37]\n\ndoc63835: StarLink corn recall. The US corn supply was monitored by the Federal Grain Inspection Service for the presence of the StarLink Bt proteins from 2001 until 2010.[45][46]\n\ndoc63831: StarLink corn recall. In 2002, Aventis, Garst, Kraft Foods, Azteca Foods, Azteca Milling, and Mission Foods settled a lawsuit brought by two people, and the grandmother of a third, who claimed to have had allergic reactions to StarLink, for $9 million.[41]\n\ndoc1902253: Genetically modified maize. StarLink corn was subsequently found in food destined for consumption by humans in the US, Japan, and South Korea.[99]:20\u201321 This corn became the subject of the widely publicized Starlink corn recall, which started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain the corn. Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued.[102][103] The registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000. (Pioneer had been bought by AgrEvo which then became Aventis CropScience at the time of the incident,[99]:15\u201316 which was later bought by Bayer[104]\n\ndoc63824: StarLink corn recall. In January 2001 under a written agreement with 17 US states,[26] Aventis initiated a program called the StarLink Enhanced Stewardship (SES) program, under which StarLink corn, buffer corn, and any corn stored in grain elevators that had become mixed with StarLink, would be bought by Aventis and directed to animal feed and non-food industrial use (e.g. ethanol production); the program included free kits to test for StarLink, and covered costs of cleaning equipment, transport, and storage facilities, as well as increased transportation costs.[27]:193\u00e2\u20ac\u201c95 Aventis estimated the cost would be between $100 million to $1 billion.[28][29][30]\n\ndoc63836: StarLink corn recall. In August 2013, StarLink corn was reported to be found again contaminating some foods in Saudi Arabia.[47]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc63832: StarLink corn recall. In 2002, nongovernmental organizations claimed that aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.[42]:96\n\ndoc1902256: Genetically modified maize. The US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001.[108]\n\ndoc1902254: Genetically modified maize. Fifty-one people reported adverse effects to the FDA; US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to Starlink.[105] However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.[106]\n\ndoc63817: StarLink corn recall. StarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing two modifications: a gene for resistance to glufosinate, and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein called Cry9C.[2] Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink, causing heightened regulatory scrutiny.[3] StarLink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems, which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident,[4]:15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply.[4]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[5]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed only.[3][6] StarLink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998. After the incident the company at first tried to get the application for human consumption approved, and then withdrew the product entirely from the market.[4]:15\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000. She also stated that food safety and legal compliance were Kraft's main priority.[18]\n\ndoc63822: StarLink corn recall. Safeway later announced it would recall its store brand taco shells at the recommendation of a consumer group on October 12, 2000. This was done as a precaution, and no StarLink was confirmed to be found in any of the products[19] On October 13 and 14, Mission Foods voluntary recalled about 300 products.[20][21] On October 22, 2000 it was reported that Kellogg's had shut down a plant as a precaution because they couldn't guarantee that StarLink corn flour had not been supplied to the plant.[22]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc63818: StarLink corn recall. The Garst Seed Company (part of the Advanta group) was licensed by Aventis to produce and sell StarLink seed in the US.[7]:8\n\ndoc1902216: Genetically modified maize. Genetically modified maize (corn) is a genetically modified crop. Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits, including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow. One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000.\n\ndoc2393539: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2001, when the Starlink corn recall became public, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was criticized for being slow to react by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety.[480] He also criticized the EPA and Aventis CropScience for statements at the time of the recall, that indicated they did not anticipate that such a thing would happen.[480]\n\ndoc63830: StarLink corn recall. In September 2001, a group of about 5,000 Taco Bell franchisees and a handful of taco shell suppliers brought a class-action lawsuit against Aventis, Garst Seed Co.; Gruma Corp., (\"the largest producer and distributor of corn flour and tortillas in the United States; and Azteca Milling seeking damages.[39] This suit was voluntarily dismissed in December 2001.[40]:65\n\ndoc243568: Dietary fiber. One insoluble fiber, resistant starch from high-amylose corn, has been used as a supplement and may contribute to improving insulin sensitivity and glycemic management[24][25][26] as well as promoting regularity[27] and possibly relief of diarrhea.[28][29][30] One preliminary finding indicates that resistant corn starch may reduce symptoms of ulcerative colitis.[31]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc1902257: Genetically modified maize. In 2005, aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.[109]\n\ndoc1902252: Genetically modified maize. StarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop.[98] Starlink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food.[99]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[100]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed.[98][101] Starlink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998.[99]:15\n\ndoc1459267: Maize. Maize is a major source of starch. Cornstarch (maize flour) is a major ingredient in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also a major source of cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.\n\ndoc1159953: Corn production in the United States. The subsidies have been criticized for:\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc1698877: Sweet corn. Sweet corn (Zea mays convar. saccharata var. rugosa;[1] also called sugar corn and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy.\n\ndoc1459231: Maize. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc1459271: Maize. Starch from maize can also be made into plastics, fabrics, adhesives, and many other chemical products.\n\ndoc1954259: Pellagra. The whole dried corn kernel contains a nutritious germ and a thin seed coat that provides some fiber. [46] There are two important considerations for using ground whole-grain corn.\n\ndoc132522: Food security. Corn, a pillar of American agriculture for years, is now mainly used for ethanol, high fructose corn syrup and bio-based plastics.[110] About 40 percent of corn is used for ethanol and 36% is used as animal feed.[110] Only a tiny fraction of corn is used as a food source, much of that fraction is used for high-fructose corn syrup, which is a main ingredient in processed, unhealthy junk food.[110]\n\ndoc63819: StarLink corn recall. In 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert was launched by seven organizations (Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Environmental Trust, Organic Consumers Association, Pesticide Action Network North America, and The State PIRGs) to lobby the FDA, Congress and companies to ban or stop using GMOs.[8][9][10] One of their activities was testing food for the presence of GMOs via a lab called Genetic ID, the vice president of which was Jeffrey M. Smith.[11][12]\n\ndoc63829: StarLink corn recall. In June 2001 Tricon Global Restaurants, 20% owners of Taco Bell at the time, announced a $60 million settlement with some of the suppliers of the supermarket taco shells; under the terms of the settlement they could not disclose the identity of suppliers.[38] Tricon stated that the settlement would go to Taco Bell franchisees and Tricon would not receive any of it. Tricon also announced that it, along with the suppliers and franchisees, would initiate litigation against the parties responsible for StarLink entering the food chain.\n\ndoc63820: StarLink corn recall. On September 18, 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert released a statement that Genetic ID had conducted tests on \"Taco Bell Home Originals\" brand taco shells, made by Kraft Foods that had been purchased in a grocery store near Washington, DC, and had detected StarLink;[13] the story was reported on by The Washington Post.[4]:15[12] Kraft distributed the Taco Bell-branded taco shells under a 1996 license agreement with Taco Bell.[14]:54\n\ndoc1459187: Maize. Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing that of wheat or rice. However, not all of this maize is consumed directly by humans. Some of the maize production is used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.[2]\n\ndoc976701: Genetically modified food. Corn used for food and ethanol has been genetically modified to tolerate various herbicides and to express a protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that kills certain insects.[67] About 90% of the corn grown in the US was genetically modified in 2010.[68] In the US in 2015, 81% of corn acreage contained the Bt trait and 89% of corn acreage contained the glyphosate-tolerant trait.[43] Corn can be processed into grits, meal and flour as an ingredient in pancakes, muffins, doughnuts, breadings and batters, as well as baby foods, meat products, cereals and some fermented products. Corn-based masa flour and masa dough are used in the production of taco shells, corn chips and tortillas.[69]\n\ndoc1377423: Taco Bell. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of Taco Bell-branded shells were recalled from supermarkets. The shells contained a variety of genetically modified corn called StarLink that was not approved for human consumption. StarLink was approved only for use in animal feed because of questions about whether it can cause allergic reactions in people.[15] It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type.[16] In 2001, Tricon Global announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.[17]\n\ndoc1460180: Genetically modified crops. Many strains of corn have been developed in recent years to combat the spread of Maize dwarf mosaic virus, a costly virus that causes stunted growth which is carried in Johnson grass and spread by aphid insect vectors. These strands are commercially available although the resistance is not standard among GM corn variants.[152]\n\ndoc634858: Starch. Resistant starch is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals. High amylose starch from corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than other types of starch and retains its resistant starch content through baking, mild extrusion and other food processing techniques. It is used as an insoluble dietary fiber in processed foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, pretzels and other low moisture foods. It is also utilized as a dietary supplement for its health benefits. Published studies have shown that resistant starch helps to improve insulin sensitivity,[39] increases satiety[40] and improves markers of colonic function.[41] It has been suggested that resistant starch contributes to the health benefits of intact whole grains.[42]\n\ndoc1698890: Sweet corn. Early cultivars, including those used by Native Americans, were the result of the mutant su (\"sugary\") allele.[2] They contain about 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10% sugar by weight.\n\ndoc2116622: Pringles. Pringles also produces several \"multi-grain\" varieties which have some of their base starch ingredients replaced with corn flour, rice, wheat bran, black beans,[26] and barley flour.[27]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc1698891: Sweet corn. Supersweet corn are cultivars of sweet corn which produce higher than normal levels of sugar developed by University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign professor John Laughnan.[4] He was investigating two specific genes in sweet corn, one of which, the sh2 gene, caused the corn to shrivel when dry. After further investigation Laughnan discovered that the endosperm of sh2 sweet corn kernels store less starch and from 4 to 10 times more sugar than normal su sweet corn. He published his findings in 1953, disclosing the advantages of growing supersweet sweet corn, but many corn breeders lacked enthusiasm for the new supersweet corn. Illinois Foundation Seeds Inc. was the first seed company to release a supersweet corn and it was called 'Illini Xtra Sweet', but widespread use of supersweet hybrids did not occur until the early 1980s. The popularity of supersweet corn rose due to its long shelf life and large sugar content when compared to conventional sweet corn. This has allowed the long-distance shipping of sweet corn and has enabled manufacturers to can sweet corn without adding extra sugar or salt.\n\ndoc2119412: Corn flakes. Dr. Kellogg introduced Kellogg's Corn Flakes in hopes that it would reduce dyspepsia and, in accordance with the practices of the Seventh-day Adventists, masturbation and excessive sexual intercourse.[7]\n\ndoc1299056: Insulin resistance. Resistant starch from high-amylose corn, amylomaize, has been shown to reduce insulin resistance in healthy individuals, in individuals with insulin resistance, and in individuals with type 2 diabetes.[98] Animal studies demonstrate that it cannot reverse damage already done by high glucose levels, but that it reduces insulin resistance and reduces the development of further damage.[99][100][101]\n\ndoc720310: Corn ethanol. The gluten protein is dried and filtered to make a corn gluten- meals co-product and is highly sought after by poultry broiler operators as a feed ingredient. The steeping liquor produced is concentrated and dried with the fiber and sold as corn gluten feed to in the livestock industry. The heavy steep water is also sold as a feed ingredient and is used as an environmentally friendly alternative to salt in the winter months. The corn starch and remaining water can then be processed one of three ways: 1) fermented into ethanol, through a similar process as dry milling, 2) dried and sold as modified corn starch, or 3) made into corn syrup.\n\ndoc2669824: Corn nut. A popular variety of cornick is the lighter, chicharr\u00f3n-like chichacorn,[7] a semi-popped style of cornick using glutinous corn from the Ilocos Region[8] which is treated with lime before frying.[9]\n\ndoc1672455: Corn on the cob. Corn on the cob (known regionally as \"pole corn\", \"corn stick\", \"sweet pole\", \"butter-pop\" or \"long maize\")[citation needed]  is a culinary term used for a cooked ear of freshly picked maize from a cultivar of sweet corn. Sweet corn is the most common variety of maize eaten directly off the cob.[1] The ear is picked while the endosperm is in the \"milk stage\" so that the kernels are still tender. Ears of corn are steamed or boiled, usually without their green husks, or roasted with them. The husk leaves are in any case removed before serving.\n\ndoc1159949: Corn production in the United States. See also US Agricultural subsidies\n\ndoc1258897: Combine harvester. While a grain platform can be used for corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with snap rolls that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically, since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row.\n\ndoc2548966: Glucose syrup. The starch needs to be swelled to allow the enzymes or acid to act upon it. When grain is used, sulfur dioxide is added to prevent spoilage.\n\ndoc1159942: Corn production in the United States. The total production of corn in the US for the year 2013-14 is reported to be 13.016 billion bushels of which the major use is for manufacture of ethanol and its co-product (Distillers' Dried Grains with Solubles) accounting for 37% (27% + 10%) or 4,845 million bushels (3,552 + 1,293). The other uses are given in the table.[6]\n\ndoc720318: Corn ethanol. The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), the ethanol industry's lobby group, claims that ethanol production does increase the price of corn by increasing demand. The RFA claims that ethanol production has positive economic effect for US farmers, but it does not elaborate on the effect for other populations where field corn is part of the staple diet. An RFA lobby document states that \"In a January 2007 statement, the USDA Chief Economist stated that farm program payments were expected to be reduced by some $6 billion due to the higher value of a bushel of corn.[16]\n\ndoc1698893: Sweet corn. All of the alleles responsible for sweet corn are recessive, so it must be isolated from other corn, such as field corn and popcorn, that release pollen at the same time; the endosperm develops from genes from both parents, and heterozygous kernels will be tough and starchy. The se and su alleles do not need to be isolated from each other. However supersweet cultivars containing the sh2 allele must be grown in isolation from other cultivars to avoid cross-pollination and resulting starchiness, either in space (various sources quote minimum quarantine distances from 100 to 400 feet or 30 to 120 m) or in time (i.e., the supersweet corn does not pollinate at the same time as other corn in nearby fields).\n\ndoc2548965: Glucose syrup. Before conversion of starch to glucose can begin, the starch must be separated from the plant material. This includes removing fibre and protein (which can be valuable by-products, for example wheat or maize gluten[1]p.\u00c2\u00a022). Protein produces off-flavours and colours due to the Maillard reaction, and fibre is insoluble and has to be removed to allow the starch to become hydrated. The plant material also needs to be ground as part of this process to expose the starch to the water.\n\ndoc720313: Corn ethanol. Since most U.S. ethanol is produced from corn and the required electricity from many distilleries comes mainly from coal plants, there has been considerable debate on the sustainability of corn-based bio-ethanol in replacing fossil fuels. Controversy and concerns relate to the large amount of arable land required for crops and its impact on grain supply, direct and indirect land use change effects, as well as issues regarding its energy balance and carbon intensity considering the full life cycle of ethanol production, and also issues regarding water use and pollution due to the increase expansion of ethanol production.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]\n\ndoc2032743: Callus. The hard part at the center of the corn resembles a funnel with a broad raised top and a pointed bottom. Because of their shape, corns intensify the pressure at the tip and can cause deep tissue damage and ulceration.[2] The scientific name for a corn is heloma (plural helomata). A hard corn is called a heloma durum, while a soft corn is called a heloma molle.\n\ndoc65066: Popcorn. Some strains of corn (taxonomized as Zea mays) are cultivated specifically as popping corns. The Zea mays variety everta, a special kind of flint corn, is the most common of these.\n\ndoc1698881: Sweet corn. There are currently hundreds of cultivars, with more constantly being developed.\n\ndoc1459219: Maize. Many forms of maize are used for food, sometimes classified as various subspecies related to the amount of starch each has:\n\ndoc1175102: Resistant starch. Isolated and extracted resistant starch and foods rich in resistant starch have been used to fortify foods to increase their dietary fiber content.[27][38][44] Typically, food fortification utilizes RS2 resistant starch from high amylose corn, RS3 resistant starch from cassava and RS4 resistant starch from wheat and potato, as these sources can survive varying degrees of food processing without losing their resistant starch content.[8]\n\ndoc1698887: Sweet corn. If left to dry on the plant, kernels may be taken off the cob and cooked in oil where, unlike popcorn, they expand to about double the original kernel size and are often called corn nuts. A soup may also be made from the plant, called sweet corn soup.\n\ndoc2068179: Glucose. Glucose is produced commercially via the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch. Many crops can be used as the source of starch. Maize, rice, wheat, cassava, corn husk and sago are all used in various parts of the world. In the United States, corn starch (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Most commercial glucose occurs as a component of invert sugar, a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolysed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical.[26] Glucose syrup, also known as corn syrup, is essentially a purified aqueous solution of saccharides obtained from edible starch that has a dextrose equivalency (DE) of 20 or more. Dried corn syrup is glucose syrup with the water removed. Glucose has a DE of 100; dried maltodextrin has a DE of less than 20. Corn syrup has a DE between 20 and 95.[29]\n\ndoc1672457: Corn on the cob. Within a day of corn being picked it starts converting sugar into starch, which results in reduction in the level of natural sweetness. Corn should be cooked and served the same day it has been harvested, as it takes only a single day for corn to lose up to 25% of its sweetness.[2]\n\ndoc2580838: Corn syrup. Corn syrup is a food syrup which is made from the starch of corn (called maize in some countries) and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade. Corn syrup, also known as glucose syrup to confectioners, is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose.\n\ndoc720314: Corn ethanol. The U.S. Department of Energy has published facts stating that current corn-based ethanol results in a 19% reduction in greenhouse gases, and is better for the environment than other gasoline additives such as MTBE.[14]\n\ndoc1315436: List of maize dishes. Pudding corn is prepared from stewed corn, water, any of various thickening agents, and optional additional flavoring or texturing ingredients\n\ndoc2055305: Keratoconus. Corneal collagen cross-linking is a developing treatment which aims to strengthen the cornea, however, according to a 2015 Cochrane review, there is insufficient evidence to determine if it is useful in keratoconus.[60]\n\ndoc1159952: Corn production in the United States. In 2014, the \"direct payments\" portion of subsidies was abolished, and subsidies were mostly replaced with two programs. Farmers may pick Price Loss Coverage (a guarantee that the farmer will get a certain price for their crop) and Agricultural Risk Coverage (which guarantees a certain amount of revenue).[16][15]\n\ndoc1159950: Corn production in the United States. Corn in the United States has been subsidized since the 1930s, when a drop in demand from post-war Europe caused a food glut and prices crashed. In the 1980s, subsidies increased substantially.[15]\n\ndoc516371: High-fructose corn syrup. Since 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared HFCS to be safe as a food ingredient.[5] In 2015, production of HFCS in the United States was 8.5 million tons from some 500 million bushels of corn.[55]\n\ndoc1902217: Genetically modified maize. Corn varieties resistant to glyphosate herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by Monsanto, and are known as \"Roundup Ready Corn\". They tolerate the use of Roundup.[1] Bayer CropScience developed \"Liberty Link Corn\" that is resistant to glufosinate.[2] Pioneer Hi-Bred has developed and markets corn hybrids with tolerance to imidazoline herbicides under the trademark \"Clearfield\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though in these hybrids, the herbicide-tolerance trait was bred using tissue culture selection and the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate, not genetic engineering.[3] Consequently, the regulatory framework governing the approval of transgenic crops does not apply for Clearfield.[3]\n\ndoc2548958: Glucose syrup. Glucose syrup, also known as confectioner's glucose, is a syrup made from the hydrolysis of starch. Glucose is a sugar. Maize (corn) is commonly used as the source of the starch in the US, in which case the syrup is called \"corn syrup\", but glucose syrup is also made from potatoes and wheat, and less often from barley, rice and cassava.[1]p.\u00c2\u00a021[2]\n\ndoc707458: Beer. The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, able to be saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops.[49] A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley.[50] Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others.[51] The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.\n\ndoc1159944: Corn production in the United States. Two methods are used to produce ethanol from corn and other plants such as sugar cane. The residual product (DDGS) is about 33% of the input stream and is used as livestock feed. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to produce E10 and E85 fuels for automobile vehicles. Its manufacture has created 400,000 jobs in the US and its environmental friendliness is recorded in the form of reduced gas emissions of 25.3 million metric tons. One bushel of corn can produce 2.8 gallons of ethanol, 17.5\u00a0lbs of livestock feed and 18\u00a0lbs of carbon dioxide.[8]\n\ndoc65075: Popcorn. As the oil and the water within the kernel are heated, they turn the moisture in the kernel into pressurized steam. Under these conditions, the starch inside the kernel gelatinizes, softens, and becomes pliable. The internal pressure of the entrapped steam continues to increase until the breaking point of the hull is reached: a pressure of approximately 135\u00a0psi (930\u00a0kPa)[12] and a temperature of 180\u00a0\u00b0C (356\u00a0\u00b0F). The hull thereupon ruptures rapidly and actually explodes, causing a sudden drop in pressure inside the kernel and a corresponding rapid expansion of the steam, which expands the starch and proteins of the endosperm into airy foam. As the foam rapidly cools, the starch and protein polymers set into the familiar crispy puff.[12] Special varieties are grown to give improved popping yield. Though the kernels of some wild types will pop, the cultivated strain is Zea mays everta, which is a special kind of flint corn.\n\ndoc607369: Alpha-amylase. The first step in the production of high-fructose corn syrup is the treatment of cornstarch with \u00ce\u00b1-amylase, producing shorter chains of sugars oligosaccharides.\n\ndoc553720: Alternative energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has conducted various ethanol research projects, mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol.[113] Cellulosic ethanol has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol. It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood, grasses, or non-edible parts of plants.[114] Moreover, some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol.[115] Sandia National Laboratories conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research[116] and is also a member of the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI), a research institute founded by the United States Department of Energy with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels.[117]\n\ndoc469656: McDonald's. McDonald's has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that biodegradation is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.[115]\n\ndoc731326: Real Genius. In January, 2011, it was further demonstrated on video[15] in a home setting that a kernel of corn directly exposed to laser light from accessible consumer level lasers could be popped as reported by TechCrunch.[16]\n\ndoc2580841: Corn syrup. Corn syrup is produced from number 2 yellow dent corn.[7] When wet milled, about 2.3 litres of corn are required to yield an average of 947g of starch, to produce 1\u00a0kg of glucose or dextrose syrup. A bushel (25\u00a0kg) of corn will yield an average of 31.5 pounds (14.3\u00a0kg) of starch, which in turn will yield about 33.3 pounds (15.1\u00a0kg) of syrup. Thus, it takes about 2,300 litres of corn to produce a tonne of glucose syrup, or 60 bushels (1524\u00a0kg) of corn to produce one short ton.[8][9]\n\ndoc1460191: Genetically modified crops. high-fructose corn syrup\n\ndoc1460192: Genetically modified crops. high-fructose corn syrup\n\ndoc1460194: Genetically modified crops. high-fructose corn syrup\n\ndoc1902247: Genetically modified maize. In 2017, a large-scale study found \"pervasive presence of transgenes and glyphosate in maize-derived food in Mexico\"[88]\n\ndoc2313758: Ethanol fuel by country. U.S. corn-derived ethanol costs 30% more because the corn starch must first be converted to sugar before being distilled into alcohol. Despite this cost differential in production, in contrast to Japan and Sweden, the U.S. did not import much of Brazilian ethanol because of U.S. trade barriers corresponding to a tariff of 54-cent per gallon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a levy designed to offset the 45-cent per gallon blender's federal tax credit that was applied to ethanol no matter its country of origin.[5][108][109][110] In 2011 the U.S. Congress decided not to extend the tariff and the tax credit, and as a result both ended on December 31, 2011. Since 1980 the U.S. ethanol industry was awarded an estimated US$45 billion in subsidies.[111][112] One advantage U.S. corn-derived ethanol offers is the ability to return 1/3 of the feedstock back into the market as a replacement for the corn used in the form of Distillers Dried Grain.[21]\n\ndoc2513240: Biodegradable plastic. There is much debate about the total carbon, fossil fuel and water usage in manufacturing bioplastics from natural materials and whether they are a negative impact to human food supply. To make 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb) of polylactic acid, the most common commercially available compostable plastic, 2.65\u00a0kg (5.8\u00a0lb) of corn is required.[11] Since 270 million tonnes of plastic are made every year,[citation needed] replacing conventional plastic with corn-derived polylactic acid would remove 715.5 million tonnes from the world's food supply, at a time when global warming is reducing tropical farm productivity.[citation needed] \"Although U.S. corn is a highly productive crop, with typical yields between 140 and 160 bushels per acre, the resulting delivery of food by the corn system is far lower. Today\u2019s corn crop is mainly used for biofuels (roughly 40 percent of U.S. corn is used for ethanol) and as animal feed (roughly 36 percent of U.S. corn, plus distillers grains left over from ethanol production, is fed to cattle, pigs and chickens). Much of the rest is exported. Only a tiny fraction of the national corn crop is directly used for food for Americans, much of that for high fructose corn syrup.\"[12]\n\ndoc1175091: Resistant starch. In 2016, the U.S. FDA approved a qualified health claim stating that resistant starch might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but with qualifying language for product labels that limited scientific evidence exists to support this claim. Because qualified health claims are issued when the science evidence is weak or not consistent, the FDA requires specific labeling language, such as the guideline concerning resistant starch: \"High-amylose maize resistant starch may reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes. FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence for this claim.\"[20][21]\n\ndoc2626510: Aeroponics. According to Reese it is a historical feat to grow corn in an aeroponic apparatus for bio-massing. The university\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past attempts to grow all types of corn using hydroponics ended in failure.\n\ndoc1159951: Corn production in the United States. US subsidies for corn have averaged 4.7 billion dollars per year over the twenty years from 1995-2014 inclusive.[16] 2014 projections were that the US would spend $97.29 billion/year on farm and food programs over the next decade.[17]\n\ndoc2313732: Ethanol fuel by country. The production of fuel ethanol from corn in the United States is controversial for a few reasons. Production of ethanol from corn is 5 to 6 times less efficient than producing it from sugarcane. The reason that corn has been notoriously used for ethanol production is because farmers are either paid to destroy crops or to not grow corn crops. Another reason is that the cost of processing and transporting raw corn can be more expensive than transporting and processing it in to ethanol fuel. Corn production is highly dependent upon government subsidies, so naturally ethanol derived from corn is also highly dependent on government subsidies. Contrary to what most would claim, ethanol is not a food-versus-fuel issue.[45][46] Corn, along with other crops that have been distilled are still a usable food source for cattle. Known as dried distillers grains, it is proven to be significantly healthier and easier for cattle to digest.[47] On October 2008, the first \"biofuels corridor\" was officially opened along I-65, a major interstate highway in the central United States. Stretching from northern Indiana to southern Alabama, this corridor consisting of more than 200 individual fueling stations makes it possible to drive a flex-fueled vehicle from Lake Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico without being further than a quarter tank worth of fuel from an E85 pump.[48][49][50]\n\ndoc634848: Starch. The starch industry extracts and refines starches from seeds, roots and tubers, by wet grinding, washing, sieving and drying. Today, the main commercial refined starches are cornstarch, tapioca, arrowroot,[33] and wheat, rice, and potato starches. To a lesser extent, sources of refined starch are sweet potato, sago and mung bean. To this day, starch is extracted from more than 50 types of plants.\n\ndoc2580839: Corn syrup. The more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup, since glucose syrup is in the United States most commonly made from corn starch.[1][2] Technically, glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono-, di-, and higher-saccharides and can be made from any source of starch; wheat, tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources.[3][4][5]\n\ndoc1698880: Sweet corn. Sweet corn production in the 20th century was influenced by the following key developments:\n\ndoc1240406: 2007\u201308 world food price crisis. Nevertheless, supporters of ethanol claim that using corn for ethanol is not responsible for the worst food riots in the world, many of which have been caused by the price of rice and oil, which are not affected by biofuel use but rather by supply and demand.\n\n"

Following the recalls, 51 people reported adverse effects to the FDA; these reports were reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to StarLink.[32] The CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence the reactions these people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the StarLink Bt protein.[33]\n\ndoc63827: StarLink corn recall. The EPA was criticized by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety, who said \"Clearly they didn't do anything here until they became embarrassed.\"[34] The EPA and Aventis were also criticized for statements at the time of the recall that indicated they had no idea such a thing would happen.[35] \"If there has been a violation of our licensing process, then we would have a very great concern,\" was attributed to Stephen Johnson of the EPA. Margaret Gadsby of Aventis was quoted with her earlier statement \"We have difficulty imagining how our corn could end up in the human food supply.\"\n\ndoc63825: StarLink corn recall. It was estimated that due to grain mixing StarLink corn could have existed in more than 50% of the US corn supply[2] and that overall, the StarLink incident depressed the price of US corn about 7% for about a year.[31]:533\n\ndoc63823: StarLink corn recall. On October 26, 2000 StarLink corn was reported to be found in Japan and South Korea.[4]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 The market and distribution network for corn in the US was thrown into disarray through 2001, as there were no existing means to segregate the grain;[23][24] the disarray eventually eased due to the Aventis' testing and buyback program discussed below.[25]\n\ndoc63828: StarLink corn recall. The registration for the StarLink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[36]:7 In February 2001, it was announced that the president, general counsel, and vice president of market development for Aventis CropScience (US), had been fired in response to the recall.[37]\n\ndoc63835: StarLink corn recall. The US corn supply was monitored by the Federal Grain Inspection Service for the presence of the StarLink Bt proteins from 2001 until 2010.[45][46]\n\ndoc63831: StarLink corn recall. In 2002, Aventis, Garst, Kraft Foods, Azteca Foods, Azteca Milling, and Mission Foods settled a lawsuit brought by two people, and the grandmother of a third, who claimed to have had allergic reactions to StarLink, for $9 million.[41]\n\ndoc1902253: Genetically modified maize. StarLink corn was subsequently found in food destined for consumption by humans in the US, Japan, and South Korea.[99]:20\u201321 This corn became the subject of the widely publicized Starlink corn recall, which started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain the corn. Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued.[102][103] The registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000. (Pioneer had been bought by AgrEvo which then became Aventis CropScience at the time of the incident,[99]:15\u201316 which was later bought by Bayer[104]\n\ndoc63824: StarLink corn recall. In January 2001 under a written agreement with 17 US states,[26] Aventis initiated a program called the StarLink Enhanced Stewardship (SES) program, under which StarLink corn, buffer corn, and any corn stored in grain elevators that had become mixed with StarLink, would be bought by Aventis and directed to animal feed and non-food industrial use (e.g. ethanol production); the program included free kits to test for StarLink, and covered costs of cleaning equipment, transport, and storage facilities, as well as increased transportation costs.[27]:193\u00e2\u20ac\u201c95 Aventis estimated the cost would be between $100 million to $1 billion.[28][29][30]\n\ndoc63836: StarLink corn recall. In August 2013, StarLink corn was reported to be found again contaminating some foods in Saudi Arabia.[47]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc63832: StarLink corn recall. In 2002, nongovernmental organizations claimed that aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.[42]:96\n\ndoc1902256: Genetically modified maize. The US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001.[108]\n\ndoc1902254: Genetically modified maize. Fifty-one people reported adverse effects to the FDA; US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to Starlink.[105] However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.[106]\n\ndoc63817: StarLink corn recall. StarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing two modifications: a gene for resistance to glufosinate, and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein called Cry9C.[2] Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink, causing heightened regulatory scrutiny.[3] StarLink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems, which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident,[4]:15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply.[4]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[5]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed only.[3][6] StarLink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998. After the incident the company at first tried to get the application for human consumption approved, and then withdrew the product entirely from the market.[4]:15\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000. She also stated that food safety and legal compliance were Kraft's main priority.[18]\n\ndoc63822: StarLink corn recall. Safeway later announced it would recall its store brand taco shells at the recommendation of a consumer group on October 12, 2000. This was done as a precaution, and no StarLink was confirmed to be found in any of the products[19] On October 13 and 14, Mission Foods voluntary recalled about 300 products.[20][21] On October 22, 2000 it was reported that Kellogg's had shut down a plant as a precaution because they couldn't guarantee that StarLink corn flour had not been supplied to the plant.[22]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc63818: StarLink corn recall. The Garst Seed Company (part of the Advanta group) was licensed by Aventis to produce and sell StarLink seed in the US.[7]:8\n\ndoc1902216: Genetically modified maize. Genetically modified maize (corn) is a genetically modified crop. Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits, including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow. One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000.\n\ndoc2393539: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2001, when the Starlink corn recall became public, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was criticized for being slow to react by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety.[480] He also criticized the EPA and Aventis CropScience for statements at the time of the recall, that indicated they did not anticipate that such a thing would happen.[480]\n\ndoc63830: StarLink corn recall. In September 2001, a group of about 5,000 Taco Bell franchisees and a handful of taco shell suppliers brought a class-action lawsuit against Aventis, Garst Seed Co.; Gruma Corp., (\"the largest producer and distributor of corn flour and tortillas in the United States; and Azteca Milling seeking damages.[39] This suit was voluntarily dismissed in December 2001.[40]:65\n\ndoc243568: Dietary fiber. One insoluble fiber, resistant starch from high-amylose corn, has been used as a supplement and may contribute to improving insulin sensitivity and glycemic management[24][25][26] as well as promoting regularity[27] and possibly relief of diarrhea.[28][29][30] One preliminary finding indicates that resistant corn starch may reduce symptoms of ulcerative colitis.[31]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc1902257: Genetically modified maize. In 2005, aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.[109]\n\ndoc1902252: Genetically modified maize. StarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop.[98] Starlink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food.[99]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[100]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed.[98][101] Starlink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998.[99]:15\n\ndoc1459267: Maize. Maize is a major source of starch. Cornstarch (maize flour) is a major ingredient in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also a major source of cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.\n\ndoc1159953: Corn production in the United States. The subsidies have been criticized for:\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc1698877: Sweet corn. Sweet corn (Zea mays convar. saccharata var. rugosa;[1] also called sugar corn and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy.\n\ndoc1459231: Maize. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc1459271: Maize. Starch from maize can also be made into plastics, fabrics, adhesives, and many other chemical products.\n\ndoc1954259: Pellagra. The whole dried corn kernel contains a nutritious germ and a thin seed coat that provides some fiber. [46] There are two important considerations for using ground whole-grain corn.\n\ndoc132522: Food security. Corn, a pillar of American agriculture for years, is now mainly used for ethanol, high fructose corn syrup and bio-based plastics.[110] About 40 percent of corn is used for ethanol and 36% is used as animal feed.[110] Only a tiny fraction of corn is used as a food source, much of that fraction is used for high-fructose corn syrup, which is a main ingredient in processed, unhealthy junk food.[110]\n\ndoc63819: StarLink corn recall. In 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert was launched by seven organizations (Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Environmental Trust, Organic Consumers Association, Pesticide Action Network North America, and The State PIRGs) to lobby the FDA, Congress and companies to ban or stop using GMOs.[8][9][10] One of their activities was testing food for the presence of GMOs via a lab called Genetic ID, the vice president of which was Jeffrey M. Smith.[11][12]\n\ndoc63829: StarLink corn recall. In June 2001 Tricon Global Restaurants, 20% owners of Taco Bell at the time, announced a $60 million settlement with some of the suppliers of the supermarket taco shells; under the terms of the settlement they could not disclose the identity of suppliers.[38] Tricon stated that the settlement would go to Taco Bell franchisees and Tricon would not receive any of it. Tricon also announced that it, along with the suppliers and franchisees, would initiate litigation against the parties responsible for StarLink entering the food chain.\n\ndoc63820: StarLink corn recall. On September 18, 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert released a statement that Genetic ID had conducted tests on \"Taco Bell Home Originals\" brand taco shells, made by Kraft Foods that had been purchased in a grocery store near Washington, DC, and had detected StarLink;[13] the story was reported on by The Washington Post.[4]:15[12] Kraft distributed the Taco Bell-branded taco shells under a 1996 license agreement with Taco Bell.[14]:54\n\ndoc1459187: Maize. Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing that of wheat or rice. However, not all of this maize is consumed directly by humans. Some of the maize production is used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.[2]\n\ndoc976701: Genetically modified food. Corn used for food and ethanol has been genetically modified to tolerate various herbicides and to express a protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that kills certain insects.[67] About 90% of the corn grown in the US was genetically modified in 2010.[68] In the US in 2015, 81% of corn acreage contained the Bt trait and 89% of corn acreage contained the glyphosate-tolerant trait.[43] Corn can be processed into grits, meal and flour as an ingredient in pancakes, muffins, doughnuts, breadings and batters, as well as baby foods, meat products, cereals and some fermented products. Corn-based masa flour and masa dough are used in the production of taco shells, corn chips and tortillas.[69]\n\ndoc1377423: Taco Bell. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of Taco Bell-branded shells were recalled from supermarkets. The shells contained a variety of genetically modified corn called StarLink that was not approved for human consumption. StarLink was approved only for use in animal feed because of questions about whether it can cause allergic reactions in people.[15] It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type.[16] In 2001, Tricon Global announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.[17]\n\ndoc1460180: Genetically modified crops. Many strains of corn have been developed in recent years to combat the spread of Maize dwarf mosaic virus, a costly virus that causes stunted growth which is carried in Johnson grass and spread by aphid insect vectors. These strands are commercially available although the resistance is not standard among GM corn variants.[152]\n\ndoc634858: Starch. Resistant starch is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals. High amylose starch from corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than other types of starch and retains its resistant starch content through baking, mild extrusion and other food processing techniques. It is used as an insoluble dietary fiber in processed foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, pretzels and other low moisture foods. It is also utilized as a dietary supplement for its health benefits. Published studies have shown that resistant starch helps to improve insulin sensitivity,[39] increases satiety[40] and improves markers of colonic function.[41] It has been suggested that resistant starch contributes to the health benefits of intact whole grains.[42]\n\ndoc1698890: Sweet corn. Early cultivars, including those used by Native Americans, were the result of the mutant su (\"sugary\") allele.[2] They contain about 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10% sugar by weight.\n\ndoc2116622: Pringles. Pringles also produces several \"multi-grain\" varieties which have some of their base starch ingredients replaced with corn flour, rice, wheat bran, black beans,[26] and barley flour.[27]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc1698891: Sweet corn. Supersweet corn are cultivars of sweet corn which produce higher than normal levels of sugar developed by University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign professor John Laughnan.[4] He was investigating two specific genes in sweet corn, one of which, the sh2 gene, caused the corn to shrivel when dry. After further investigation Laughnan discovered that the endosperm of sh2 sweet corn kernels store less starch and from 4 to 10 times more sugar than normal su sweet corn. He published his findings in 1953, disclosing the advantages of growing supersweet sweet corn, but many corn breeders lacked enthusiasm for the new supersweet corn. Illinois Foundation Seeds Inc. was the first seed company to release a supersweet corn and it was called 'Illini Xtra Sweet', but widespread use of supersweet hybrids did not occur until the early 1980s. The popularity of supersweet corn rose due to its long shelf life and large sugar content when compared to conventional sweet corn. This has allowed the long-distance shipping of sweet corn and has enabled manufacturers to can sweet corn without adding extra sugar or salt.\n\ndoc2119412: Corn flakes. Dr. Kellogg introduced Kellogg's Corn Flakes in hopes that it would reduce dyspepsia and, in accordance with the practices of the Seventh-day Adventists, masturbation and excessive sexual intercourse.[7]\n\ndoc1299056: Insulin resistance. Resistant starch from high-amylose corn, amylomaize, has been shown to reduce insulin resistance in healthy individuals, in individuals with insulin resistance, and in individuals with type 2 diabetes.[98] Animal studies demonstrate that it cannot reverse damage already done by high glucose levels, but that it reduces insulin resistance and reduces the development of further damage.[99][100][101]\n\ndoc720310: Corn ethanol. The gluten protein is dried and filtered to make a corn gluten- meals co-product and is highly sought after by poultry broiler operators as a feed ingredient. The steeping liquor produced is concentrated and dried with the fiber and sold as corn gluten feed to in the livestock industry. The heavy steep water is also sold as a feed ingredient and is used as an environmentally friendly alternative to salt in the winter months. The corn starch and remaining water can then be processed one of three ways: 1) fermented into ethanol, through a similar process as dry milling, 2) dried and sold as modified corn starch, or 3) made into corn syrup.\n\ndoc2669824: Corn nut. A popular variety of cornick is the lighter, chicharr\u00f3n-like chichacorn,[7] a semi-popped style of cornick using glutinous corn from the Ilocos Region[8] which is treated with lime before frying.[9]\n\ndoc1672455: Corn on the cob. Corn on the cob (known regionally as \"pole corn\", \"corn stick\", \"sweet pole\", \"butter-pop\" or \"long maize\")[citation needed]  is a culinary term used for a cooked ear of freshly picked maize from a cultivar of sweet corn. Sweet corn is the most common variety of maize eaten directly off the cob.[1] The ear is picked while the endosperm is in the \"milk stage\" so that the kernels are still tender. Ears of corn are steamed or boiled, usually without their green husks, or roasted with them. The husk leaves are in any case removed before serving.\n\ndoc1159949: Corn production in the United States. See also US Agricultural subsidies\n\ndoc1258897: Combine harvester. While a grain platform can be used for corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with snap rolls that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically, since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row.\n\ndoc2548966: Glucose syrup. The starch needs to be swelled to allow the enzymes or acid to act upon it. When grain is used, sulfur dioxide is added to prevent spoilage.\n\ndoc1159942: Corn production in the United States. The total production of corn in the US for the year 2013-14 is reported to be 13.016 billion bushels of which the major use is for manufacture of ethanol and its co-product (Distillers' Dried Grains with Solubles) accounting for 37% (27% + 10%) or 4,845 million bushels (3,552 + 1,293). The other uses are given in the table.[6]\n\ndoc720318: Corn ethanol. The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), the ethanol industry's lobby group, claims that ethanol production does increase the price of corn by increasing demand. The RFA claims that ethanol production has positive economic effect for US farmers, but it does not elaborate on the effect for other populations where field corn is part of the staple diet. An RFA lobby document states that \"In a January 2007 statement, the USDA Chief Economist stated that farm program payments were expected to be reduced by some $6 billion due to the higher value of a bushel of corn.[16]\n\ndoc1698893: Sweet corn. All of the alleles responsible for sweet corn are recessive, so it must be isolated from other corn, such as field corn and popcorn, that release pollen at the same time; the endosperm develops from genes from both parents, and heterozygous kernels will be tough and starchy. The se and su alleles do not need to be isolated from each other. However supersweet cultivars containing the sh2 allele must be grown in isolation from other cultivars to avoid cross-pollination and resulting starchiness, either in space (various sources quote minimum quarantine distances from 100 to 400 feet or 30 to 120 m) or in time (i.e., the supersweet corn does not pollinate at the same time as other corn in nearby fields).\n\ndoc2548965: Glucose syrup. Before conversion of starch to glucose can begin, the starch must be separated from the plant material. This includes removing fibre and protein (which can be valuable by-products, for example wheat or maize gluten[1]p.\u00c2\u00a022). Protein produces off-flavours and colours due to the Maillard reaction, and fibre is insoluble and has to be removed to allow the starch to become hydrated. The plant material also needs to be ground as part of this process to expose the starch to the water.\n\ndoc720313: Corn ethanol. Since most U.S. ethanol is produced from corn and the required electricity from many distilleries comes mainly from coal plants, there has been considerable debate on the sustainability of corn-based bio-ethanol in replacing fossil fuels. Controversy and concerns relate to the large amount of arable land required for crops and its impact on grain supply, direct and indirect land use change effects, as well as issues regarding its energy balance and carbon intensity considering the full life cycle of ethanol production, and also issues regarding water use and pollution due to the increase expansion of ethanol production.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]\n\ndoc2032743: Callus. The hard part at the center of the corn resembles a funnel with a broad raised top and a pointed bottom. Because of their shape, corns intensify the pressure at the tip and can cause deep tissue damage and ulceration.[2] The scientific name for a corn is heloma (plural helomata). A hard corn is called a heloma durum, while a soft corn is called a heloma molle.\n\ndoc65066: Popcorn. Some strains of corn (taxonomized as Zea mays) are cultivated specifically as popping corns. The Zea mays variety everta, a special kind of flint corn, is the most common of these.\n\ndoc1698881: Sweet corn. There are currently hundreds of cultivars, with more constantly being developed.\n\ndoc1459219: Maize. Many forms of maize are used for food, sometimes classified as various subspecies related to the amount of starch each has:\n\ndoc1175102: Resistant starch. Isolated and extracted resistant starch and foods rich in resistant starch have been used to fortify foods to increase their dietary fiber content.[27][38][44] Typically, food fortification utilizes RS2 resistant starch from high amylose corn, RS3 resistant starch from cassava and RS4 resistant starch from wheat and potato, as these sources can survive varying degrees of food processing without losing their resistant starch content.[8]\n\ndoc1698887: Sweet corn. If left to dry on the plant, kernels may be taken off the cob and cooked in oil where, unlike popcorn, they expand to about double the original kernel size and are often called corn nuts. A soup may also be made from the plant, called sweet corn soup.\n\ndoc2068179: Glucose. Glucose is produced commercially via the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch. Many crops can be used as the source of starch. Maize, rice, wheat, cassava, corn husk and sago are all used in various parts of the world. In the United States, corn starch (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Most commercial glucose occurs as a component of invert sugar, a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolysed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical.[26] Glucose syrup, also known as corn syrup, is essentially a purified aqueous solution of saccharides obtained from edible starch that has a dextrose equivalency (DE) of 20 or more. Dried corn syrup is glucose syrup with the water removed. Glucose has a DE of 100; dried maltodextrin has a DE of less than 20. Corn syrup has a DE between 20 and 95.[29]\n\ndoc1672457: Corn on the cob. Within a day of corn being picked it starts converting sugar into starch, which results in reduction in the level of natural sweetness. Corn should be cooked and served the same day it has been harvested, as it takes only a single day for corn to lose up to 25% of its sweetness.[2]\n\ndoc2580838: Corn syrup. Corn syrup is a food syrup which is made from the starch of corn (called maize in some countries) and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade. Corn syrup, also known as glucose syrup to confectioners, is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose.\n\ndoc720314: Corn ethanol. The U.S. Department of Energy has published facts stating that current corn-based ethanol results in a 19% reduction in greenhouse gases, and is better for the environment than other gasoline additives such as MTBE.[14]\n\ndoc1315436: List of maize dishes. Pudding corn is prepared from stewed corn, water, any of various thickening agents, and optional additional flavoring or texturing ingredients\n\ndoc2055305: Keratoconus. Corneal collagen cross-linking is a developing treatment which aims to strengthen the cornea, however, according to a 2015 Cochrane review, there is insufficient evidence to determine if it is useful in keratoconus.[60]\n\ndoc1159952: Corn production in the United States. In 2014, the \"direct payments\" portion of subsidies was abolished, and subsidies were mostly replaced with two programs. Farmers may pick Price Loss Coverage (a guarantee that the farmer will get a certain price for their crop) and Agricultural Risk Coverage (which guarantees a certain amount of revenue).[16][15]\n\ndoc1159950: Corn production in the United States. Corn in the United States has been subsidized since the 1930s, when a drop in demand from post-war Europe caused a food glut and prices crashed. In the 1980s, subsidies increased substantially.[15]\n\ndoc516371: High-fructose corn syrup. Since 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared HFCS to be safe as a food ingredient.[5] In 2015, production of HFCS in the United States was 8.5 million tons from some 500 million bushels of corn.[55]\n\ndoc1902217: Genetically modified maize. Corn varieties resistant to glyphosate herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by Monsanto, and are known as \"Roundup Ready Corn\". They tolerate the use of Roundup.[1] Bayer CropScience developed \"Liberty Link Corn\" that is resistant to glufosinate.[2] Pioneer Hi-Bred has developed and markets corn hybrids with tolerance to imidazoline herbicides under the trademark \"Clearfield\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though in these hybrids, the herbicide-tolerance trait was bred using tissue culture selection and the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate, not genetic engineering.[3] Consequently, the regulatory framework governing the approval of transgenic crops does not apply for Clearfield.[3]\n\ndoc2548958: Glucose syrup. Glucose syrup, also known as confectioner's glucose, is a syrup made from the hydrolysis of starch. Glucose is a sugar. Maize (corn) is commonly used as the source of the starch in the US, in which case the syrup is called \"corn syrup\", but glucose syrup is also made from potatoes and wheat, and less often from barley, rice and cassava.[1]p.\u00c2\u00a021[2]\n\ndoc707458: Beer. The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, able to be saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops.[49] A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley.[50] Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others.[51] The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.\n\ndoc1159944: Corn production in the United States. Two methods are used to produce ethanol from corn and other plants such as sugar cane. The residual product (DDGS) is about 33% of the input stream and is used as livestock feed. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to produce E10 and E85 fuels for automobile vehicles. Its manufacture has created 400,000 jobs in the US and its environmental friendliness is recorded in the form of reduced gas emissions of 25.3 million metric tons. One bushel of corn can produce 2.8 gallons of ethanol, 17.5\u00a0lbs of livestock feed and 18\u00a0lbs of carbon dioxide.[8]\n\ndoc65075: Popcorn. As the oil and the water within the kernel are heated, they turn the moisture in the kernel into pressurized steam. Under these conditions, the starch inside the kernel gelatinizes, softens, and becomes pliable. The internal pressure of the entrapped steam continues to increase until the breaking point of the hull is reached: a pressure of approximately 135\u00a0psi (930\u00a0kPa)[12] and a temperature of 180\u00a0\u00b0C (356\u00a0\u00b0F). The hull thereupon ruptures rapidly and actually explodes, causing a sudden drop in pressure inside the kernel and a corresponding rapid expansion of the steam, which expands the starch and proteins of the endosperm into airy foam. As the foam rapidly cools, the starch and protein polymers set into the familiar crispy puff.[12] Special varieties are grown to give improved popping yield. Though the kernels of some wild types will pop, the cultivated strain is Zea mays everta, which is a special kind of flint corn.\n\ndoc607369: Alpha-amylase. The first step in the production of high-fructose corn syrup is the treatment of cornstarch with \u00ce\u00b1-amylase, producing shorter chains of sugars oligosaccharides.\n\ndoc553720: Alternative energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has conducted various ethanol research projects, mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol.[113] Cellulosic ethanol has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol. It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood, grasses, or non-edible parts of plants.[114] Moreover, some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol.[115] Sandia National Laboratories conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research[116] and is also a member of the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI), a research institute founded by the United States Department of Energy with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels.[117]\n\ndoc469656: McDonald's. McDonald's has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that biodegradation is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.[115]\n\ndoc731326: Real Genius. In January, 2011, it was further demonstrated on video[15] in a home setting that a kernel of corn directly exposed to laser light from accessible consumer level lasers could be popped as reported by TechCrunch.[16]\n\ndoc2580841: Corn syrup. Corn syrup is produced from number 2 yellow dent corn.[7] When wet milled, about 2.3 litres of corn are required to yield an average of 947g of starch, to produce 1\u00a0kg of glucose or dextrose syrup. A bushel (25\u00a0kg) of corn will yield an average of 31.5 pounds (14.3\u00a0kg) of starch, which in turn will yield about 33.3 pounds (15.1\u00a0kg) of syrup. Thus, it takes about 2,300 litres of corn to produce a tonne of glucose syrup, or 60 bushels (1524\u00a0kg) of corn to produce one short ton.[8][9]\n\ndoc1460191: Genetically modified crops. high-fructose corn syrup\n\ndoc1460192: Genetically modified crops. high-fructose corn syrup\n\ndoc1460194: Genetically modified crops. high-fructose corn syrup\n\ndoc1902247: Genetically modified maize. In 2017, a large-scale study found \"pervasive presence of transgenes and glyphosate in maize-derived food in Mexico\"[88]\n\ndoc2313758: Ethanol fuel by country. U.S. corn-derived ethanol costs 30% more because the corn starch must first be converted to sugar before being distilled into alcohol. Despite this cost differential in production, in contrast to Japan and Sweden, the U.S. did not import much of Brazilian ethanol because of U.S. trade barriers corresponding to a tariff of 54-cent per gallon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a levy designed to offset the 45-cent per gallon blender's federal tax credit that was applied to ethanol no matter its country of origin.[5][108][109][110] In 2011 the U.S. Congress decided not to extend the tariff and the tax credit, and as a result both ended on December 31, 2011. Since 1980 the U.S. ethanol industry was awarded an estimated US$45 billion in subsidies.[111][112] One advantage U.S. corn-derived ethanol offers is the ability to return 1/3 of the feedstock back into the market as a replacement for the corn used in the form of Distillers Dried Grain.[21]\n\ndoc2513240: Biodegradable plastic. There is much debate about the total carbon, fossil fuel and water usage in manufacturing bioplastics from natural materials and whether they are a negative impact to human food supply. To make 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb) of polylactic acid, the most common commercially available compostable plastic, 2.65\u00a0kg (5.8\u00a0lb) of corn is required.[11] Since 270 million tonnes of plastic are made every year,[citation needed] replacing conventional plastic with corn-derived polylactic acid would remove 715.5 million tonnes from the world's food supply, at a time when global warming is reducing tropical farm productivity.[citation needed] \"Although U.S. corn is a highly productive crop, with typical yields between 140 and 160 bushels per acre, the resulting delivery of food by the corn system is far lower. Today\u2019s corn crop is mainly used for biofuels (roughly 40 percent of U.S. corn is used for ethanol) and as animal feed (roughly 36 percent of U.S. corn, plus distillers grains left over from ethanol production, is fed to cattle, pigs and chickens). Much of the rest is exported. Only a tiny fraction of the national corn crop is directly used for food for Americans, much of that for high fructose corn syrup.\"[12]\n\ndoc1175091: Resistant starch. In 2016, the U.S. FDA approved a qualified health claim stating that resistant starch might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but with qualifying language for product labels that limited scientific evidence exists to support this claim. Because qualified health claims are issued when the science evidence is weak or not consistent, the FDA requires specific labeling language, such as the guideline concerning resistant starch: \"High-amylose maize resistant starch may reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes. FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence for this claim.\"[20][21]\n\ndoc2626510: Aeroponics. According to Reese it is a historical feat to grow corn in an aeroponic apparatus for bio-massing. The university\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past attempts to grow all types of corn using hydroponics ended in failure.\n\ndoc1159951: Corn production in the United States. US subsidies for corn have averaged 4.7 billion dollars per year over the twenty years from 1995-2014 inclusive.[16] 2014 projections were that the US would spend $97.29 billion/year on farm and food programs over the next decade.[17]\n\ndoc2313732: Ethanol fuel by country. The production of fuel ethanol from corn in the United States is controversial for a few reasons. Production of ethanol from corn is 5 to 6 times less efficient than producing it from sugarcane. The reason that corn has been notoriously used for ethanol production is because farmers are either paid to destroy crops or to not grow corn crops. Another reason is that the cost of processing and transporting raw corn can be more expensive than transporting and processing it in to ethanol fuel. Corn production is highly dependent upon government subsidies, so naturally ethanol derived from corn is also highly dependent on government subsidies. Contrary to what most would claim, ethanol is not a food-versus-fuel issue.[45][46] Corn, along with other crops that have been distilled are still a usable food source for cattle. Known as dried distillers grains, it is proven to be significantly healthier and easier for cattle to digest.[47] On October 2008, the first \"biofuels corridor\" was officially opened along I-65, a major interstate highway in the central United States. Stretching from northern Indiana to southern Alabama, this corridor consisting of more than 200 individual fueling stations makes it possible to drive a flex-fueled vehicle from Lake Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico without being further than a quarter tank worth of fuel from an E85 pump.[48][49][50]\n\ndoc634848: Starch. The starch industry extracts and refines starches from seeds, roots and tubers, by wet grinding, washing, sieving and drying. Today, the main commercial refined starches are cornstarch, tapioca, arrowroot,[33] and wheat, rice, and potato starches. To a lesser extent, sources of refined starch are sweet potato, sago and mung bean. To this day, starch is extracted from more than 50 types of plants.\n\ndoc2580839: Corn syrup. The more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup, since glucose syrup is in the United States most commonly made from corn starch.[1][2] Technically, glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono-, di-, and higher-saccharides and can be made from any source of starch; wheat, tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources.[3][4][5]\n\ndoc1698880: Sweet corn. Sweet corn production in the 20th century was influenced by the following key developments:\n\ndoc1240406: 2007\u201308 world food price crisis. Nevertheless, supporters of ethanol claim that using corn for ethanol is not responsible for the worst food riots in the world, many of which have been caused by the price of rice and oil, which are not affected by biofuel use but rather by supply and demand.\n\n"
