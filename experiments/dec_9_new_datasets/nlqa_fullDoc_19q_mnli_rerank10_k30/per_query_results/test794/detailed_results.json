The public consultation process was coordinated by the Free Software Foundation with assistance from Software Freedom Law Center, Free Software Foundation Europe,[31] and other free software groups. Comments were collected from the public via the gplv3.fsf.org web portal,[32] using purpose-written software called stet.\n\ndoc681437: History of free and open-source software. In 1989, the first version of the GNU General Public License was published.[26] A slightly updated version 2 was published in 1991. In 1989, some GNU developers formed the company Cygnus Solutions.[27] The GNU project's kernel, later called \"GNU Hurd\", was continually delayed, but most other components were completed by 1991. Some of these, especially the GNU Compiler Collection, had become market leaders[clarification needed] in their own right. The GNU Debugger and GNU Emacs were also notable successes.\n\ndoc28253: GNU/Linux naming controversy. So if you were going to pick a name for the system based on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate single choice would be GNU. But we don't think that is the right way to consider the question. The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific software packages. [...] Many people have made major contributions to the free software in the system, and they all deserve credit. But the reason it is an integrated system\u2014and not just a collection of useful programs\u2014is because the GNU Project set out to make it one. We made a list of the programs needed to make a complete free system, and we systematically wrote, or found people to write, everything on the list.\n\ndoc681436: History of free and open-source software. In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to write a complete operating system free from constraints on use of its source code. Particular incidents that motivated this include a case where an annoying printer couldn't be fixed because the source code was withheld from users.[24] Stallman also published the GNU Manifesto in 1985 to outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of free software. Another probable inspiration for the GNU project and its manifesto was a disagreement between Stallman and Symbolics, Inc. over MIT's access to updates Symbolics had made to its Lisp machine, which was based on MIT code.[25] Soon after the launch, he[17] used[clarification needed] the existing term \"free software\" and founded the Free Software Foundation to promote the concept. The Free Software Definition was published in February 1986.\n\ndoc1443808: GNU General Public License. The final version of the license text was published on 29 June 2007.[52]\n\ndoc1443825: GNU General Public License. In April 2017 a US federal court ruled that an open-source license is an enforceable contract.[64]\n\ndoc1443893: GNU General Public License. In 2009 David Chisnall described in an InformIT article, \"The Failure of the GPL\", the problems with the GPL, among them incompatibility and complexity of the license text.[174]\n\ndoc1443790: GNU General Public License. Version 3 was developed to attempt to address these concerns and was officially released on 29 June 2007.[20]\n\ndoc1443803: GNU General Public License.

The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc28263: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Regarding suggestions that renaming efforts stem from egotism or personal pique, Stallman has responded that his interest is not in giving credit to himself but to the GNU Project: \"Some people think that it's because I want my ego to be fed. Of course, I'm not asking you to call it 'Stallmanix'.\"[47] Stallman has admitted to irritation, although he believes it to be justified in response to seeing \"an idealistic project stymied and made ineffective, because people don't usually give it the credit for what it has done,\" concluding \"If you're an idealist like me, that can ruin your whole decade.\"[48]\n\ndoc1443796: GNU General Public License. In late 2005, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) announced work on version 3 of the GPL (GPLv3). On 16 January 2006, the first \"discussion draft\" of GPLv3 was published, and the public consultation began. The public consultation was originally planned for nine to fifteen months but finally stretched to eighteen months with four drafts being published. The official GPLv3 was released by FSF on 29 June 2007. GPLv3 was written by Richard Stallman, with legal counsel from Eben Moglen and Richard Fontana from the Software Freedom Law Center.[26][27][28]\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1443895: GNU General Public License. Already in September 2006, in the draft process of the GPLv3, several high-profile developers of the Linux kernel, for instance Linus Torvalds, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Andrew Morton, warned on a splitting of the FOSS community: the release of GPLv3 portends the Balkanisation of the entire Open Source Universe upon which we rely.[44] Similarly Benjamin Mako Hill argued in 2006 on the GPLv3 draft, noting that a united, collaborating community is more important than a single license.[176]\n\ndoc1443801: GNU General Public License. The third draft was released on 28 March 2007.[37] This draft included language intended to prevent patent-related agreements such as the controversial Microsoft-Novell patent agreement and restricts the anti-tivoization clauses to a legal definition of a \"User\" or \"consumer product\". It also explicitly removed the section on \"Geographical Limitations\", whose probable removal had been announced at the launch of the public consultation.\n\ndoc28244: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc1443854: GNU General Public License. The first known violation of the GPL was in 1989, when NeXT extended the GCC compiler to support Objective-C, but did not publicly release the changes.[80] After an inquiry they created a public patch. There was no lawsuit filed for this violation.[81]\n\ndoc1443797: GNU General Public License. According to Stallman, the most important changes are in relation to software patents, free software license compatibility, the definition of \"source code\", and hardware restrictions on software modification (\"tivoization\").[26][29] Other changes relate to internationalization, how license violations are handled, and how additional permissions can be granted by the copyright holder.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories. The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.[1]\n\ndoc1443898: GNU General Public License. Lawrence Rosen, attorney and computer specialist, praised in 2007 how the community using the Apache license were now able to work together with the GPL community in a compatible manner, as the problems of GPLv2 compatibility with Apache licensed software were resolved with the GPLv3. He said, I predict that one of the biggest success stories of GPLv3 will be the realization that the entire universe of free and open source software can thus be combined into comprehensive open source solutions for customers worldwide.[181]\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443892: GNU General Public License. In 2007 Allison Randal, who took part in the GPL draft committee, criticized the GPLv3 for being incompatible with the GPLv2[171] and for missing clarity in the formulation.[172] Similarly, Whurley prophesised in 2007 the downfall of the GPL due to the lack of focus for the developers with GPLv3 which would drive them towards permissive licenses.[173]\n\ndoc2183008: Politics of South Africa. The Government of National Unity (GNU) established under the interim constitution ostensibly remained in effect until the 1999 national elections. The parties originally comprising the GNU \u2013 the African National Congress (ANC), the National Party (NP), and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) \u2013 shared executive power. On 30 June 1996, the NP withdrew from the GNU to become part of the opposition.\n\ndoc28280: GNU/Linux naming controversy. There are lots of people on this bus; I don't hear a clamor of support that GNU is more essential than many of the other components; can't take a wheel away, and end up with a functional vehicle, or an engine, or the seats. I recommend you be happy we have a bus.[57]\n\ndoc1443804: GNU General Public License. This aims to make future such deals ineffective. The license is also meant to cause Microsoft to extend the patent licenses it grants to Novell customers for the use of GPLv3 software to all users of that GPLv3 software; this is possible only if Microsoft is legally a \"conveyor\" of the GPLv3 software.[39][40]\n\ndoc1443885: GNU General Public License. In 2001 the term received broader public attention when Craig Mundie, Microsoft Senior Vice President, described the GPL as being \"viral\".[156] Mundie argues that the GPL has a \"viral\" effect in that it only allows the conveyance of whole programs, which means programs that link to GPL libraries must themselves be under a GPL-compatible license, else they cannot be combined and distributed.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc28248: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Modern free software and Open-source software systems are composed of software by many different authors, including the Linux kernel developers, the GNU project, and other vendors such as those behind the X Window System. Desktop- and server-based distributions use GNU components such as the GNU C Library (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (Coreutils), and bash.\n\ndoc1443789: GNU General Public License. The second version of the license, version 2, was released in 1991. Over the following 15 years, members of the free software community became concerned over problems in the GPLv2 license that could let someone exploit GPL-licensed software in ways contrary to the license's intent.[19] These problems included tivoization (the inclusion of GPL-licensed software in hardware that refuses to run modified versions of its software), compatibility issues similar to those of the Affero General Public License\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand patent deals between Microsoft and distributors of free and open source software, which some viewed as an attempt to use patents as a weapon against the free software community.\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\ndoc1443891: GNU General Public License. In 2005, open source software advocate Eric S. Raymond questioned the relevance of GPL at that point in time for the FOSS ecosystem, stating: \"We don't need the GPL anymore. It's based on the belief that open source software is weak and needs to be protected. Open source would be succeeding faster if the GPL didn't make lots of people nervous about adopting it.\".[169] Richard Stallman replied that: \"GPL is designed to [...] ensure that every user of a program gets the essential freedoms\u2014to run it, to study and change the source code, to redistribute copies, and to publish modified versions\u00a0... [Raymond] addresses the issue in terms of different goals and values\u2014those of \"open source,\" which do not include defending software users' freedom to share and change software.\"[170]\n\ndoc1443880: GNU General Public License. A March 2015 analysis of the GitHub repositories revealed, for the GPL license family, a usage percentage of approx. 25% among licensed projects.[140] In June 2016 an analysis of Fedora Project's packages revealed the GNU GPL version 2 or later as the most popular license, and the GNU GPL family as the most popular license family (followed by the MIT, BSD, and GNU LGPL families).[141]\n\ndoc28278: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Others have suggested that, regardless of the merits, Stallman's persistence in what sometimes seems a lost cause makes him and GNU look bad. For example, Larry McVoy (author of BitKeeper, once used to manage Linux kernel development) opined that \"claiming credit only makes one look foolish and greedy\".[56]\n\ndoc1443894: GNU General Public License. In 2014 dtrace developer and Joyent CTO Bryan Cantrill called the copyleft GPL a \"Corporate Open Source Anti-pattern\" by being \"anti-collaborative\" and recommended instead permissive software licenses.[175]\n\ndoc1443806: GNU General Public License. Others, notably some high-profile developers of the Linux kernel, for instance Linus Torvalds, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Andrew Morton, commented to the mass media and made public statements about their objections to parts of discussion drafts 1 and 2.[44] The kernel developers referred to GPLv3 draft clauses regarding DRM/Tivoization, patents and \"additional restrictions\" and warned a Balkanisation of the \"Open Source Universe\".[44][45] Linus Torvalds, who decided to not adopt the GPLv3 for the Linux kernel,[14] reiterated his criticism even years later.[46][47]\n\ndoc1443878: GNU General Public License. In August 2013, according to Black Duck Software, the website's data shows that the GPL license family is used by 54% of open-source projects, with a breakdown of the individual licenses shown in the following table.[117] However, a later study in 2013 showed that software licensed under the GPL license family has increased, and that even the data from Black Duck Software has shown a total increase of software projects licensed under GPL. The study used public information gathered from repositories of the Debian Project, and the study criticized Black Duck Software for not publishing their methodology used in collecting statistics.[134] Daniel German, Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria in Canada, presented a talk in 2013 about the methodological challenges in determining which are the most widely used free software licenses, and showed how he could not replicate the result from Black Duck Software.[135]\n\ndoc1443786: GNU General Public License. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain.[7][9][10][11][12] Prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community.[13]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc1443858: GNU General Public License. This exactly mirrored the predictions given previously by the FSF's Eben Moglen. This ruling was important because it was the first time that a court had confirmed that violating terms of the GPL could be a copyright violation and established jurisprudence as to the enforceability of the GPL version 2 under German law.[85]\n\ndoc2608811: The Free Software Definition. In 1996, when the gnu.org website was launched, \"free software\" was defined referring to \"three levels of freedom\" by adding an explicit mention of the freedom to study the software (which could be read in the two-point definition as being part of the freedom to change the program).[4][5]  Stallman later avoided the word \"levels\", saying that you need all of the freedoms, so it's misleading to think in terms of levels.\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc1443802: GNU General Public License. The fourth discussion draft,[38] which was the last, was released on 31 May 2007. It introduced Apache License version 2.0 compatibility (prior versions are incompatible), clarified the role of outside contractors, and made an exception to avoid the perceived problems of a Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u201cNovell style agreement, saying in Section 11 paragraph 6 that:\n\ndoc979494: Compiler. Other Ada compiler efforts got under way in Britain at University of York and in Germany at University of Karlsruhe. In the U. S., Verdix (later acquired by Rational) delivered the Verdix Ada Development System (VADS) to the Army. VADS provided a set of development tools including a compiler. Unix/VADS could be hosted on a variety of Unix platforms such as DEC Ultrix and the Sun 3/60 Solaris targeted to Motorola 68020 in an Army CECOM evaluation.[33] There were soon many Ada compilers available that passed the Ada Validation tests. The Freesoftware Foundation GNU project developed the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) which provides a core capability to support multiple languages and targets. The Ada version GNAT is one of the most widely used Ada compilers. GNAT is free but there is also commercial support, for example, AdaCore, was founded in 1994 to provide commercial software solutions for Ada. GNAT Pro includes the GNU GCC based GNAT with a tool suite to provide an integrated development environment.\n\ndoc1443856: GNU General Public License. In August 2003, the SCO Group stated that they believed the GPL to have no legal validity, and that they intended to pursue lawsuits over sections of code supposedly copied from SCO Unix into the Linux kernel. This was a problematic stand for them, as they had distributed Linux and other GPL'ed code in their Caldera OpenLinux distribution, and there is little evidence that they had any legal right to do so except under the terms of the GPL.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443845: GNU General Public License. As a case study, some supposedly proprietary plugins and themes/skins for GPLv2 CMS software such as Drupal and WordPress have come under fire, with both sides of the argument taken.[76][77]\n\ndoc1443865: GNU General Public License. Cisco settled the case six months later by agreeing \"to appoint a Free Software Director for Linksys\" to ensure compliance, \"to notify previous recipients of Linksys products containing FSF programs of their rights under the GPL,\" to make source code of FSF programs freely available on its website, and to make a monetary contribution to the FSF.[92]\n\ndoc1443834: GNU General Public License. Richard Stallman and the FSF specifically encourage library-writers to license under the GPL so that proprietary programs cannot use the libraries, in an effort to protect the free-software world by giving it more tools than the proprietary world.[70]\n\ndoc705170: Open-source software. The Open Source Initiative's (OSI) definition is recognized by governments internationally[22] as the standard or de facto definition. In addition, many of the world's largest open source software projects and contributors, including Debian, Drupal Association, FreeBSD Foundation, Linux Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Wikimedia Foundation, Wordpress Foundation have committed[23] to upholding the OSI's mission and Open Source Definition through the OSI Affiliate Agreement.[24]\n\ndoc1443866: GNU General Public License. In 2011 it was noticed that GNU Emacs had been accidentally releasing some binaries without corresponding source code for two years, in opposition to the intended spirit of the GPL, resulting in a copyright violation.[93][94][95] Richard Stallman described this incident as \"a very bad mistake\",[96] which was promptly fixed. Naturally, the FSF didn't sue any downstream redistributors who also unknowingly violated the GPL by distributing these binaries.\n\ndoc1298539: United States Global AIDS Coordinator. The mission of the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) is to lead the implementation of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the largest commitment ever by any nation for an international health initiative dedicated to a single disease.[1] Initiated in 2003, PEPFAR has been reauthorized three times. What began as an emergency response has since developed into one of the largest international health initiatives. PEPFAR has supported countries in the development of national health and information systems to support the fight of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and is collaborating with countries around the world to work towards epidemic control.\n\ndoc1520006: Heartbleed. The industry's collective response to the crisis was the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a multimillion-dollar project announced by the Linux Foundation on April 24, 2014 to provide funds to critical elements of the global information infrastructure.[183] The initiative intends to allow lead developers to work full-time on their projects and to pay for security audits, hardware and software infrastructure, travel, and other expenses.[184] OpenSSL is a candidate to become the first recipient of the initiative's funding.[183]\n\ndoc1443814: GNU General Public License. In purely private (or internal) use\u2014with no sales and no distribution\u2014the software code may be modified and parts reused without requiring the source code to be released. For sales or distribution, the entire source code need to be made available to end users, including any code changes and additions\u2014in that case, copyleft is applied to ensure that end users retain the freedoms defined above.[55]\n\ndoc1443886: GNU General Public License. In 2006 Richard Stallman responded in an interview that Mundie's metaphor of a \"virus\" is wrong as software under the GPL does not \"attack\" or \"infect\" other software. Stallman believes that comparing the GPL to a virus is an extremely unfriendly thing to say, and that a better metaphor for software under the GPL would be a spider plant: If one takes a piece of it and puts it somewhere else, it grows there too.[157][158][159]\n\ndoc1443859: GNU General Public License. In May 2005, Daniel Wallace filed suit against the Free Software Foundation in the Southern District of Indiana, contending that the GPL is an illegal attempt to fix prices (at zero). The suit was dismissed in March 2006, on the grounds that Wallace had failed to state a valid anti-trust claim; the court noted that \"the GPL encourages, rather than discourages, free competition and the distribution of computer operating systems, the benefits of which directly pass to consumers\".[86] Wallace was denied the possibility of further amending his complaint, and was ordered to pay the FSF's legal expenses.\n\ndoc28262: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Because of this confusion, legal threats and public relations campaigns apparently directed against the kernel, such as those launched by the SCO Group or the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI), have been misinterpreted by many commentators who assume that the whole operating system is being targeted. SCO and the AdTI have even been accused of deliberately exploiting this confusion.[44][45][46]\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443887: GNU General Public License. On the other hand, the concept of a viral nature of the GPL was taken up by others later too.[160][161][162][163] For instance in 2008 the California Western School of Law characterized the GPL as: The GPL license is \u2018viral,\u2019 meaning any derivative work you create containing even the smallest portion of the previously GPL licensed software must also be licensed under the GPL license.[164]\n\ndoc1443862: GNU General Public License. In late 2007, the BusyBox developers and the Software Freedom Law Center embarked upon a program to gain GPL compliance from distributors of BusyBox in embedded systems, suing those who would not comply. These were claimed to be the first US uses of courts for enforcement of GPL obligations. See BusyBox GPL lawsuits.\n\ndoc28246: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Over the next few years, several suggestions arose for naming operating systems using the Linux kernel and GNU components. In 1992, the Yggdrasil Linux distribution adopted the name \"Linux/GNU/X\". In Usenet and mailing-list discussions, one can find usages of \"GNU/Linux\" as early as 1992[13] and of \"GNU+Linux\" as early as 1993.[14] The Debian project, which was at one time sponsored by the Free Software Foundation, switched to calling its product \"Debian GNU/Linux\" in early 1994;[3][15][16][17] This change followed a request by Richard Stallman (who initially proposed \"LiGNUx,\" but suggested \"GNU/Linux\" instead after hearing complaints about the awkwardness of the former term).[18] GNU's June 1994 Bulletin describes \"Linux\" as a \"free Unix system for 386 machines\" (with \"many of the utilities and libraries\" from GNU),[19] but the January 1995 Bulletin switched to the term \"GNU/Linux\" instead.[20]\n\ndoc1443821: GNU General Public License. There has been debate on whether it is a violation of the GPL to release the source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The consensus was that while unethical, it was not considered a violation. The issue was clarified when the license was altered with v2 to require that the \"preferred\" version of the source code be made available.[59]\n\ndoc1443800: GNU General Public License. During the public consultation process, 962 comments were submitted for the first draft.[33] By the end, a total of 2,636 comments had been submitted.[34][35][36]\n\ndoc705179: Open-source software. In his 1997 essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar,[40] open-source evangelist Eric S. Raymond suggests a model for developing OSS known as the bazaar model. Raymond likens the development of software by traditional methodologies to building a cathedral, \"carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation\".[40] He suggests that all software should be developed using the bazaar style, which he described as \"a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches.\"[40]\n\ndoc987926: Recursion. Recursive acronyms can also be examples of recursive humor. PHP, for example, stands for \"PHP Hypertext Preprocessor\", WINE stands for \"WINE Is Not an Emulator.\" and GNU stands for \"GNU's not Unix\".\n\ndoc1443888: GNU General Public License. The FreeBSD project has stated that a less publicized and unintended use of the GPL is that it is very favorable to large companies that want to undercut software companies. In other words, the GPL is well suited for use as a marketing weapon, potentially reducing overall economic benefit and contributing to monopolistic behavior and that the GPL can present a real problem for those wishing to commercialize and profit from software.[165]\n\ndoc1443855: GNU General Public License. In 2002, MySQL AB sued Progress NuSphere for copyright and trademark infringement in United States district court. NuSphere had allegedly violated MySQL's copyright by linking MySQL's GPL'ed code with NuSphere Gemini table without being in compliance with the license. After a preliminary hearing before Judge Patti Saris on 27 February 2002, the parties entered settlement talks and eventually settled.[82] After the hearing, FSF commented that \"Judge Saris made clear that she sees the GNU GPL to be an enforceable and binding license.\"[83]\n\ndoc5801: North American Union. The SPP initiative was officially ended on August 2009 though the North American Leaders' Summit and most of the working groups set up under the initiative remain active. Several advocates of integration saw the SPP as being insufficient. One criticism was that the governments lacked a \"vision of what North America might become\" and as such did not provide the proper context that would allow the initiative to deal with barriers to deeper integration.[30]\n\ndoc1443873: GNU General Public License. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the FOSS domain.[7][116][9][10][11][117]\n\ndoc1443897: GNU General Public License. For the LGPLv3, GNU TLS maintainer Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos similarly argued, If we assume that its [the LGPLv3] primary goal is to be used by free software, then it blatantly fails that.,[178] after he re-licensed GNU TLS from LGPLv3 back to LGPLv2.1 due to license compatibility issues.[179][180]\n\ndoc28256: GNU/Linux naming controversy. \"Sadly, a kernel by itself gets you nowhere [...] Most of the tools used with linux are GNU software.\"[36]\n\ndoc1443793: GNU General Public License. According to Richard Stallman, the major change in GPLv2 was the \"Liberty or Death\" clause, as he calls it[18] \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Section 7. The section says that licensees may distribute a GPL-covered work only if they can satisfy all of the license's obligations, despite any other legal obligations they might have. In other words, the obligations of the license may not be severed due to conflicting obligations. This provision is intended to discourage any party from using a patent infringement claim or other litigation to impair users' freedom under the license.[18]\n\ndoc1443819: GNU General Public License. Many distributors of GPL'ed programs bundle the source code with the executables. An alternative method of satisfying the copyleft is to provide a written offer to provide the source code on a physical medium (such as a CD) upon request. In practice, many GPL'ed programs are distributed over the Internet, and the source code is made available over FTP or HTTP. For Internet distribution, this complies with the license.\n\ndoc28247: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Stallman's and the FSF's efforts to include \"GNU\" in the name started around 1994, but were reportedly mostly via private communications (such as the above-mentioned request to Debian) until 1996.[21][22] In May 1996, Stallman released Emacs 19.31 with the Autoconf system target \"linux\" changed to \"lignux\" (shortly thereafter changed to \"linux-gnu\" in emacs 19.32),[23][7] and included an essay \"Linux and the GNU system\"[24] suggesting that people use the terms \"Linux-based GNU system\" (or \"GNU/Linux system\" or \"Lignux\" for short). He later used \"GNU/Linux\" exclusively, and the essay was superseded by Stallman's 1997 essay, \"Linux and the GNU project\".[6]\n\ndoc1443791: GNU General Public License. Version 1 of the GNU GPL,[21] released on 25 February 1989,[22] prevented what were then the two main ways that software distributors restricted the freedoms that define free software. The first problem was that distributors may publish binary files only\u00e2\u20ac\u201dexecutable, but not readable or modifiable by humans. To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that copying and distributing copies or any portion of the program must also make the human-readable source code available under the same licensing terms.[23]\n\ndoc1276444: Director of National Intelligence. In September 2007, the Office of the DNI released \"Intelligence Community 100 Day & 500 Day Plans for Integration & Collaboration\". These plans include a series of initiatives designed to build the foundation for increased cooperation and reform of the U.S. Intelligence Community.[15]\n\ndoc1443798: GNU General Public License. It also adds a provision that \"strips\" Digital Rights Management (DRM) of its legal value, so people can break anything a court might recognize as DRM on GPL software without breaking laws like the DMCA.[30]\n\ndoc1443817: GNU General Public License. This requirement is known as copyleft. It earns its legal power from the use of copyright on software programs. Because a GPL work is copyrighted, a licensee has no right to redistribute it, not even in modified form (barring fair use), except under the terms of the license. One is only required to adhere to the terms of the GPL if one wishes to exercise rights normally restricted by copyright law, such as redistribution. Conversely, if one distributes copies of the work without abiding by the terms of the GPL (for instance, by keeping the source code secret), he or she can be sued by the original author under copyright law.\n\ndoc830585: \"Hello, World!\" program. The Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions provide the \"hello, world\" program through the apt packaging system; this allows users to simply type \"apt-get install hello\" for the program to be installed, along with any software dependencies. While of itself useless, it serves as a sanity check and a simple example to newcomers of how to install a package. It is significantly more useful for developers, however, as it provides an example of how to create a .deb package, either traditionally or using debhelper, and the version of hello used, GNU Hello, serves as an example of how to write a GNU program.[16]\n\ndoc2237139: Sustainable procurement. The GLA also stated that their policy was \"very much as a model for broader government procurement\" but this expectation was not fulfilled in the UK Government's Sustainable Procurement Action Plan, published on March 5, 2007.[20] The Action Plan, which incorporated answers to the Sustainable Procurement Task Force, was explicitly environment-oriented in approach (Ch 4.3) with wider social issues scarcely addressed.\n\ndoc2078478: General Permitted Development Order. The website www.legislation.gov.uk, which is delivered by the National Archives, provides the original (\"as made\") version of the GPDO 2015, but states that UK statutory instruments are not carried in their \"revised\" form on the website.\n\ndoc28265: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Since a long name such as GNU/X11/Apache/Linux/TeX/Perl/Python/FreeCiv becomes absurd, at some point you will have to set a threshold and omit the names of the many other secondary contributions. There is no one obvious right place to set the threshold, so wherever you set it, we won't argue against it ... But one name that cannot result from concerns of fairness and giving credit, not for any possible threshold level, is \"Linux\". It can't be fair to give all the credit to one secondary contribution (Linux) while omitting the principal contribution (GNU).\n\ndoc1443875: GNU General Public License. After the release of the GPLv3 in June 2007, adoption of this new GPL version was much discussed[119] and some projects decided against upgrading. For instance the Linux kernel,[14][47] MySQL,[120] BusyBox,[121][122] AdvFS,[123] Blender,[124][125] and VLC media player[126] decided against adopting GPLv3. On the other hand, in 2009, two years after the release of GPLv3, Google open-source programs office manager Chris DiBona reported that the number of open-source project licensed software that had moved from GPLv2 to GPLv3 was 50%, counting the projects hosted at Google Code.[11]\n\ndoc2437992: 34th G8 summit. The international alliance End Water Poverty reports that hopes of a breakthrough in the global sanitation and water crisis at the G8 summit were dashed as the G8 delivered a communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 largely devoid of concrete actions to help the 2.6 billion people lacking access to a safe toilet, and the 1.1 billion people lacking access to clean water. Instead of agreeing an action plan to tackle what a recent WaterAid report claims kills more children than any other single factor, G8 leaders were content to report on progress at the 2009 summit and take steps to implement the discredited 2003 G8 Evian Water Action Plan.\n\ndoc2307828: George Hotz. On July 16, 2014, Google hired Hotz to work in their software security auditing team called Project Zero, which \"hopes to find zero-day vulnerabilities before the NSA\".[37] Hotz worked in Project Zero for 5 months where he developed Qira - an open source program for dynamically analysing application binaries.[citation needed]\n\ndoc855029: Linux. Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked.[33] As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users weren't legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a \"complete Unix-compatible software system\" composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984.[34] Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.[35]\n\ndoc1102841: OpenOffice.org. Development of OpenOffice.org was sponsored primarily by Sun Microsystems, which used the code as the basis for subsequent versions of StarOffice. Developers who wished to contribute code were required to sign a Contributor Agreement[32][33] granting joint ownership of any contributions to Sun (and then Oracle), in support of the StarOffice business model.[34] This was controversial for many years.[23][35][36][37][38] An alternative Public Documentation Licence (PDL)[39] was also offered for documentation not intended for inclusion or integration into the project code base.[40]\n\ndoc1443826: GNU General Public License. The text of the GPL is itself copyrighted, and the copyright is held by the Free Software Foundation.\n\ndoc1443785: GNU General Public License. The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software.[7] The license was originally written by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition.[8] The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.\n\ndoc2095383: Central Intelligence Agency. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al-Qaeda operatives.[267]\n\ndoc681494: History of free and open-source software. After the development of the GNU GPLv3, as copyright holder of many pieces of the GNU system, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) software, the FSF updated most[citation needed] of the GNU programs' licenses from GPLv2 to GPLv3. Apple, a user of GCC, and a heavy user of both DRM and patents decided to switch the compiler in its Xcode IDE from GCC to Clang, another FOSS compiler,[58] but which is under a permissive license.[59] LWN speculated that Apple was motivated partly by a desire to avoid GPLv3.[58] The Samba project also switched to GPLv3, which Apple replaced in their software suite with a closed-source, proprietary software alternative.[60]\n\ndoc28252: GNU/Linux naming controversy. The FSF justifies the name \"GNU/Linux\" primarily on the grounds that the GNU project was specifically developing a complete system, of which they argue that the Linux kernel filled one of the final gaps;[32] the large number of GNU components and GNU source code used in such systems is a secondary argument:\n\ndoc1829929: Software patent. In April 2013, the German Parliament adopted a joint motion \"against the growing trend of patent offices to grant patents on software programs\".[14]\n\ndoc1443864: GNU General Public License. After six years of repeated complaints to Cisco by the FSF, claims by Cisco that they would correct, or were correcting, their compliance problems (not providing complete copies of all source code and their modifications), of repeated new violations being discovered and reported with more products, and lack of action by Linksys (a process described on the FSF blog as a \"five-years-running game of Whack-a-Mole\"[91]) the FSF took them to court.\n\ndoc942314: Creative Commons license. In February 2012 CC0 was submitted to Open Source Initiative (OSI) for their approval.[48]  However, controversy arose over its clause which excluded from the scope of the license any relevant patents held by the copyright holder. This clause was added with scientific data in mind rather than software, but some members of the OSI believed it could weaken users' defenses against software patents. As a result, Creative Commons withdrew their submission, and the license is not currently approved by the OSI.[45][49]\n\ndoc1389269: Podcast. The term was coined for the fifth season of the Gnu World Order by Klaatu in 2010, when the show declared itself \"the world's first oggcast\".[45] At the time, the show was one of the few that released only in free formats, with no MP3 feed as an option. This gave way to other shows using the term, with hosts gathering in the #oggcastplanet connect IRC channel on the Freenode network to compare notes.\n\ndoc681449: History of free and open-source software. The term was given a big boost at an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the \"Freeware Summit\" and later named the \"Open Source Summit\"[37], the event brought together the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski of Netscape, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, the confusion caused by the name free software was brought up. Tiemann argued for \"sourceware\" as a new term, while Raymond argued for \"open source\". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference that evening. Five days later, Raymond made the first public call to the free software community to adopt the new term.[38] The Open Source Initiative was formed shortly thereafter.[35] According to the OSI Richard Stallman initially flirted with the idea of adopting the open source term.[39] But as the enormous success of the open source term buried Stallman's free software term and his message on social values and computer users' freedom,[40][41][42] later Stallman and his FSF strongly objected the OSI's approach and terminology.[43] Due to the rejection of Stallman of the term open-source software, the FOSS ecosystem is being divided in its terminology, see also Alternative terms for free software. For example, a 2002 FOSS developer survey revealed that 32.6% associate themselves with OSS, 48% with free software, and 19.4% in between or undecided.[44] Stallman still maintained, however, that users of each term were allies in the fight against proprietary software.\n\ndoc1443871: GNU General Public License. It is possible to use the GPL for text documents instead of computer programs, or more generally for all kinds of media, if it is clear what constitutes the source code (defined as \"the preferred form of the work for making changes in it\").[109] For manuals and textbooks, though, the FSF recommends the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) instead, which it created for this purpose.[110] Nevertheless, the Debian developers recommended (in a resolution adopted in 2006) to license documentation for their project under the GPL, because of the incompatibility of the GFDL with the GPL (text licensed under the GFDL cannot be incorporated into GPL software).[111][112] Also, the FLOSS Manuals foundation, an organization devoted to creating manuals for free software, decided to eschew the GFDL in favor of the GPL for its texts in 2007.[113]\n\n"

The public consultation process was coordinated by the Free Software Foundation with assistance from Software Freedom Law Center, Free Software Foundation Europe,[31] and other free software groups. Comments were collected from the public via the gplv3.fsf.org web portal,[32] using purpose-written software called stet.\n\ndoc681437: History of free and open-source software. In 1989, the first version of the GNU General Public License was published.[26] A slightly updated version 2 was published in 1991. In 1989, some GNU developers formed the company Cygnus Solutions.[27] The GNU project's kernel, later called \"GNU Hurd\", was continually delayed, but most other components were completed by 1991. Some of these, especially the GNU Compiler Collection, had become market leaders[clarification needed] in their own right. The GNU Debugger and GNU Emacs were also notable successes.\n\ndoc28253: GNU/Linux naming controversy. So if you were going to pick a name for the system based on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate single choice would be GNU. But we don't think that is the right way to consider the question. The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific software packages. [...] Many people have made major contributions to the free software in the system, and they all deserve credit. But the reason it is an integrated system\u2014and not just a collection of useful programs\u2014is because the GNU Project set out to make it one. We made a list of the programs needed to make a complete free system, and we systematically wrote, or found people to write, everything on the list.\n\ndoc681436: History of free and open-source software. In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to write a complete operating system free from constraints on use of its source code. Particular incidents that motivated this include a case where an annoying printer couldn't be fixed because the source code was withheld from users.[24] Stallman also published the GNU Manifesto in 1985 to outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of free software. Another probable inspiration for the GNU project and its manifesto was a disagreement between Stallman and Symbolics, Inc. over MIT's access to updates Symbolics had made to its Lisp machine, which was based on MIT code.[25] Soon after the launch, he[17] used[clarification needed] the existing term \"free software\" and founded the Free Software Foundation to promote the concept. The Free Software Definition was published in February 1986.\n\ndoc1443808: GNU General Public License. The final version of the license text was published on 29 June 2007.[52]\n\ndoc1443825: GNU General Public License. In April 2017 a US federal court ruled that an open-source license is an enforceable contract.[64]\n\ndoc1443893: GNU General Public License. In 2009 David Chisnall described in an InformIT article, \"The Failure of the GPL\", the problems with the GPL, among them incompatibility and complexity of the license text.[174]\n\ndoc1443790: GNU General Public License.

The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc28263: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Regarding suggestions that renaming efforts stem from egotism or personal pique, Stallman has responded that his interest is not in giving credit to himself but to the GNU Project: \"Some people think that it's because I want my ego to be fed. Of course, I'm not asking you to call it 'Stallmanix'.\"[47] Stallman has admitted to irritation, although he believes it to be justified in response to seeing \"an idealistic project stymied and made ineffective, because people don't usually give it the credit for what it has done,\" concluding \"If you're an idealist like me, that can ruin your whole decade.\"[48]\n\ndoc1443796: GNU General Public License. In late 2005, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) announced work on version 3 of the GPL (GPLv3). On 16 January 2006, the first \"discussion draft\" of GPLv3 was published, and the public consultation began. The public consultation was originally planned for nine to fifteen months but finally stretched to eighteen months with four drafts being published. The official GPLv3 was released by FSF on 29 June 2007. GPLv3 was written by Richard Stallman, with legal counsel from Eben Moglen and Richard Fontana from the Software Freedom Law Center.[26][27][28]\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1443895: GNU General Public License. Already in September 2006, in the draft process of the GPLv3, several high-profile developers of the Linux kernel, for instance Linus Torvalds, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Andrew Morton, warned on a splitting of the FOSS community: the release of GPLv3 portends the Balkanisation of the entire Open Source Universe upon which we rely.[44] Similarly Benjamin Mako Hill argued in 2006 on the GPLv3 draft, noting that a united, collaborating community is more important than a single license.[176]\n\ndoc1443801: GNU General Public License. The third draft was released on 28 March 2007.[37] This draft included language intended to prevent patent-related agreements such as the controversial Microsoft-Novell patent agreement and restricts the anti-tivoization clauses to a legal definition of a \"User\" or \"consumer product\". It also explicitly removed the section on \"Geographical Limitations\", whose probable removal had been announced at the launch of the public consultation.\n\ndoc28244: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc1443854: GNU General Public License. The first known violation of the GPL was in 1989, when NeXT extended the GCC compiler to support Objective-C, but did not publicly release the changes.[80] After an inquiry they created a public patch. There was no lawsuit filed for this violation.[81]\n\ndoc1443797: GNU General Public License. According to Stallman, the most important changes are in relation to software patents, free software license compatibility, the definition of \"source code\", and hardware restrictions on software modification (\"tivoization\").[26][29] Other changes relate to internationalization, how license violations are handled, and how additional permissions can be granted by the copyright holder.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories. The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.[1]\n\ndoc1443898: GNU General Public License. Lawrence Rosen, attorney and computer specialist, praised in 2007 how the community using the Apache license were now able to work together with the GPL community in a compatible manner, as the problems of GPLv2 compatibility with Apache licensed software were resolved with the GPLv3. He said, I predict that one of the biggest success stories of GPLv3 will be the realization that the entire universe of free and open source software can thus be combined into comprehensive open source solutions for customers worldwide.[181]\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443892: GNU General Public License. In 2007 Allison Randal, who took part in the GPL draft committee, criticized the GPLv3 for being incompatible with the GPLv2[171] and for missing clarity in the formulation.[172] Similarly, Whurley prophesised in 2007 the downfall of the GPL due to the lack of focus for the developers with GPLv3 which would drive them towards permissive licenses.[173]\n\ndoc2183008: Politics of South Africa. The Government of National Unity (GNU) established under the interim constitution ostensibly remained in effect until the 1999 national elections. The parties originally comprising the GNU \u2013 the African National Congress (ANC), the National Party (NP), and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) \u2013 shared executive power. On 30 June 1996, the NP withdrew from the GNU to become part of the opposition.\n\ndoc28280: GNU/Linux naming controversy. There are lots of people on this bus; I don't hear a clamor of support that GNU is more essential than many of the other components; can't take a wheel away, and end up with a functional vehicle, or an engine, or the seats. I recommend you be happy we have a bus.[57]\n\ndoc1443804: GNU General Public License. This aims to make future such deals ineffective. The license is also meant to cause Microsoft to extend the patent licenses it grants to Novell customers for the use of GPLv3 software to all users of that GPLv3 software; this is possible only if Microsoft is legally a \"conveyor\" of the GPLv3 software.[39][40]\n\ndoc1443885: GNU General Public License. In 2001 the term received broader public attention when Craig Mundie, Microsoft Senior Vice President, described the GPL as being \"viral\".[156] Mundie argues that the GPL has a \"viral\" effect in that it only allows the conveyance of whole programs, which means programs that link to GPL libraries must themselves be under a GPL-compatible license, else they cannot be combined and distributed.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc28248: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Modern free software and Open-source software systems are composed of software by many different authors, including the Linux kernel developers, the GNU project, and other vendors such as those behind the X Window System. Desktop- and server-based distributions use GNU components such as the GNU C Library (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (Coreutils), and bash.\n\ndoc1443789: GNU General Public License. The second version of the license, version 2, was released in 1991. Over the following 15 years, members of the free software community became concerned over problems in the GPLv2 license that could let someone exploit GPL-licensed software in ways contrary to the license's intent.[19] These problems included tivoization (the inclusion of GPL-licensed software in hardware that refuses to run modified versions of its software), compatibility issues similar to those of the Affero General Public License\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand patent deals between Microsoft and distributors of free and open source software, which some viewed as an attempt to use patents as a weapon against the free software community.\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\ndoc1443891: GNU General Public License. In 2005, open source software advocate Eric S. Raymond questioned the relevance of GPL at that point in time for the FOSS ecosystem, stating: \"We don't need the GPL anymore. It's based on the belief that open source software is weak and needs to be protected. Open source would be succeeding faster if the GPL didn't make lots of people nervous about adopting it.\".[169] Richard Stallman replied that: \"GPL is designed to [...] ensure that every user of a program gets the essential freedoms\u2014to run it, to study and change the source code, to redistribute copies, and to publish modified versions\u00a0... [Raymond] addresses the issue in terms of different goals and values\u2014those of \"open source,\" which do not include defending software users' freedom to share and change software.\"[170]\n\ndoc1443880: GNU General Public License. A March 2015 analysis of the GitHub repositories revealed, for the GPL license family, a usage percentage of approx. 25% among licensed projects.[140] In June 2016 an analysis of Fedora Project's packages revealed the GNU GPL version 2 or later as the most popular license, and the GNU GPL family as the most popular license family (followed by the MIT, BSD, and GNU LGPL families).[141]\n\ndoc28278: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Others have suggested that, regardless of the merits, Stallman's persistence in what sometimes seems a lost cause makes him and GNU look bad. For example, Larry McVoy (author of BitKeeper, once used to manage Linux kernel development) opined that \"claiming credit only makes one look foolish and greedy\".[56]\n\ndoc1443894: GNU General Public License. In 2014 dtrace developer and Joyent CTO Bryan Cantrill called the copyleft GPL a \"Corporate Open Source Anti-pattern\" by being \"anti-collaborative\" and recommended instead permissive software licenses.[175]\n\ndoc1443806: GNU General Public License. Others, notably some high-profile developers of the Linux kernel, for instance Linus Torvalds, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Andrew Morton, commented to the mass media and made public statements about their objections to parts of discussion drafts 1 and 2.[44] The kernel developers referred to GPLv3 draft clauses regarding DRM/Tivoization, patents and \"additional restrictions\" and warned a Balkanisation of the \"Open Source Universe\".[44][45] Linus Torvalds, who decided to not adopt the GPLv3 for the Linux kernel,[14] reiterated his criticism even years later.[46][47]\n\ndoc1443878: GNU General Public License. In August 2013, according to Black Duck Software, the website's data shows that the GPL license family is used by 54% of open-source projects, with a breakdown of the individual licenses shown in the following table.[117] However, a later study in 2013 showed that software licensed under the GPL license family has increased, and that even the data from Black Duck Software has shown a total increase of software projects licensed under GPL. The study used public information gathered from repositories of the Debian Project, and the study criticized Black Duck Software for not publishing their methodology used in collecting statistics.[134] Daniel German, Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria in Canada, presented a talk in 2013 about the methodological challenges in determining which are the most widely used free software licenses, and showed how he could not replicate the result from Black Duck Software.[135]\n\ndoc1443786: GNU General Public License. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain.[7][9][10][11][12] Prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community.[13]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc1443858: GNU General Public License. This exactly mirrored the predictions given previously by the FSF's Eben Moglen. This ruling was important because it was the first time that a court had confirmed that violating terms of the GPL could be a copyright violation and established jurisprudence as to the enforceability of the GPL version 2 under German law.[85]\n\ndoc2608811: The Free Software Definition. In 1996, when the gnu.org website was launched, \"free software\" was defined referring to \"three levels of freedom\" by adding an explicit mention of the freedom to study the software (which could be read in the two-point definition as being part of the freedom to change the program).[4][5]  Stallman later avoided the word \"levels\", saying that you need all of the freedoms, so it's misleading to think in terms of levels.\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc1443802: GNU General Public License. The fourth discussion draft,[38] which was the last, was released on 31 May 2007. It introduced Apache License version 2.0 compatibility (prior versions are incompatible), clarified the role of outside contractors, and made an exception to avoid the perceived problems of a Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u201cNovell style agreement, saying in Section 11 paragraph 6 that:\n\ndoc979494: Compiler. Other Ada compiler efforts got under way in Britain at University of York and in Germany at University of Karlsruhe. In the U. S., Verdix (later acquired by Rational) delivered the Verdix Ada Development System (VADS) to the Army. VADS provided a set of development tools including a compiler. Unix/VADS could be hosted on a variety of Unix platforms such as DEC Ultrix and the Sun 3/60 Solaris targeted to Motorola 68020 in an Army CECOM evaluation.[33] There were soon many Ada compilers available that passed the Ada Validation tests. The Freesoftware Foundation GNU project developed the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) which provides a core capability to support multiple languages and targets. The Ada version GNAT is one of the most widely used Ada compilers. GNAT is free but there is also commercial support, for example, AdaCore, was founded in 1994 to provide commercial software solutions for Ada. GNAT Pro includes the GNU GCC based GNAT with a tool suite to provide an integrated development environment.\n\ndoc1443856: GNU General Public License. In August 2003, the SCO Group stated that they believed the GPL to have no legal validity, and that they intended to pursue lawsuits over sections of code supposedly copied from SCO Unix into the Linux kernel. This was a problematic stand for them, as they had distributed Linux and other GPL'ed code in their Caldera OpenLinux distribution, and there is little evidence that they had any legal right to do so except under the terms of the GPL.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443845: GNU General Public License. As a case study, some supposedly proprietary plugins and themes/skins for GPLv2 CMS software such as Drupal and WordPress have come under fire, with both sides of the argument taken.[76][77]\n\ndoc1443865: GNU General Public License. Cisco settled the case six months later by agreeing \"to appoint a Free Software Director for Linksys\" to ensure compliance, \"to notify previous recipients of Linksys products containing FSF programs of their rights under the GPL,\" to make source code of FSF programs freely available on its website, and to make a monetary contribution to the FSF.[92]\n\ndoc1443834: GNU General Public License. Richard Stallman and the FSF specifically encourage library-writers to license under the GPL so that proprietary programs cannot use the libraries, in an effort to protect the free-software world by giving it more tools than the proprietary world.[70]\n\ndoc705170: Open-source software. The Open Source Initiative's (OSI) definition is recognized by governments internationally[22] as the standard or de facto definition. In addition, many of the world's largest open source software projects and contributors, including Debian, Drupal Association, FreeBSD Foundation, Linux Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Wikimedia Foundation, Wordpress Foundation have committed[23] to upholding the OSI's mission and Open Source Definition through the OSI Affiliate Agreement.[24]\n\ndoc1443866: GNU General Public License. In 2011 it was noticed that GNU Emacs had been accidentally releasing some binaries without corresponding source code for two years, in opposition to the intended spirit of the GPL, resulting in a copyright violation.[93][94][95] Richard Stallman described this incident as \"a very bad mistake\",[96] which was promptly fixed. Naturally, the FSF didn't sue any downstream redistributors who also unknowingly violated the GPL by distributing these binaries.\n\ndoc1298539: United States Global AIDS Coordinator. The mission of the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) is to lead the implementation of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the largest commitment ever by any nation for an international health initiative dedicated to a single disease.[1] Initiated in 2003, PEPFAR has been reauthorized three times. What began as an emergency response has since developed into one of the largest international health initiatives. PEPFAR has supported countries in the development of national health and information systems to support the fight of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and is collaborating with countries around the world to work towards epidemic control.\n\ndoc1520006: Heartbleed. The industry's collective response to the crisis was the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a multimillion-dollar project announced by the Linux Foundation on April 24, 2014 to provide funds to critical elements of the global information infrastructure.[183] The initiative intends to allow lead developers to work full-time on their projects and to pay for security audits, hardware and software infrastructure, travel, and other expenses.[184] OpenSSL is a candidate to become the first recipient of the initiative's funding.[183]\n\ndoc1443814: GNU General Public License. In purely private (or internal) use\u2014with no sales and no distribution\u2014the software code may be modified and parts reused without requiring the source code to be released. For sales or distribution, the entire source code need to be made available to end users, including any code changes and additions\u2014in that case, copyleft is applied to ensure that end users retain the freedoms defined above.[55]\n\ndoc1443886: GNU General Public License. In 2006 Richard Stallman responded in an interview that Mundie's metaphor of a \"virus\" is wrong as software under the GPL does not \"attack\" or \"infect\" other software. Stallman believes that comparing the GPL to a virus is an extremely unfriendly thing to say, and that a better metaphor for software under the GPL would be a spider plant: If one takes a piece of it and puts it somewhere else, it grows there too.[157][158][159]\n\ndoc1443859: GNU General Public License. In May 2005, Daniel Wallace filed suit against the Free Software Foundation in the Southern District of Indiana, contending that the GPL is an illegal attempt to fix prices (at zero). The suit was dismissed in March 2006, on the grounds that Wallace had failed to state a valid anti-trust claim; the court noted that \"the GPL encourages, rather than discourages, free competition and the distribution of computer operating systems, the benefits of which directly pass to consumers\".[86] Wallace was denied the possibility of further amending his complaint, and was ordered to pay the FSF's legal expenses.\n\ndoc28262: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Because of this confusion, legal threats and public relations campaigns apparently directed against the kernel, such as those launched by the SCO Group or the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI), have been misinterpreted by many commentators who assume that the whole operating system is being targeted. SCO and the AdTI have even been accused of deliberately exploiting this confusion.[44][45][46]\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443887: GNU General Public License. On the other hand, the concept of a viral nature of the GPL was taken up by others later too.[160][161][162][163] For instance in 2008 the California Western School of Law characterized the GPL as: The GPL license is \u2018viral,\u2019 meaning any derivative work you create containing even the smallest portion of the previously GPL licensed software must also be licensed under the GPL license.[164]\n\ndoc1443862: GNU General Public License. In late 2007, the BusyBox developers and the Software Freedom Law Center embarked upon a program to gain GPL compliance from distributors of BusyBox in embedded systems, suing those who would not comply. These were claimed to be the first US uses of courts for enforcement of GPL obligations. See BusyBox GPL lawsuits.\n\ndoc28246: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Over the next few years, several suggestions arose for naming operating systems using the Linux kernel and GNU components. In 1992, the Yggdrasil Linux distribution adopted the name \"Linux/GNU/X\". In Usenet and mailing-list discussions, one can find usages of \"GNU/Linux\" as early as 1992[13] and of \"GNU+Linux\" as early as 1993.[14] The Debian project, which was at one time sponsored by the Free Software Foundation, switched to calling its product \"Debian GNU/Linux\" in early 1994;[3][15][16][17] This change followed a request by Richard Stallman (who initially proposed \"LiGNUx,\" but suggested \"GNU/Linux\" instead after hearing complaints about the awkwardness of the former term).[18] GNU's June 1994 Bulletin describes \"Linux\" as a \"free Unix system for 386 machines\" (with \"many of the utilities and libraries\" from GNU),[19] but the January 1995 Bulletin switched to the term \"GNU/Linux\" instead.[20]\n\ndoc1443821: GNU General Public License. There has been debate on whether it is a violation of the GPL to release the source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The consensus was that while unethical, it was not considered a violation. The issue was clarified when the license was altered with v2 to require that the \"preferred\" version of the source code be made available.[59]\n\ndoc1443800: GNU General Public License. During the public consultation process, 962 comments were submitted for the first draft.[33] By the end, a total of 2,636 comments had been submitted.[34][35][36]\n\ndoc705179: Open-source software. In his 1997 essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar,[40] open-source evangelist Eric S. Raymond suggests a model for developing OSS known as the bazaar model. Raymond likens the development of software by traditional methodologies to building a cathedral, \"carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation\".[40] He suggests that all software should be developed using the bazaar style, which he described as \"a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches.\"[40]\n\ndoc987926: Recursion. Recursive acronyms can also be examples of recursive humor. PHP, for example, stands for \"PHP Hypertext Preprocessor\", WINE stands for \"WINE Is Not an Emulator.\" and GNU stands for \"GNU's not Unix\".\n\ndoc1443888: GNU General Public License. The FreeBSD project has stated that a less publicized and unintended use of the GPL is that it is very favorable to large companies that want to undercut software companies. In other words, the GPL is well suited for use as a marketing weapon, potentially reducing overall economic benefit and contributing to monopolistic behavior and that the GPL can present a real problem for those wishing to commercialize and profit from software.[165]\n\ndoc1443855: GNU General Public License. In 2002, MySQL AB sued Progress NuSphere for copyright and trademark infringement in United States district court. NuSphere had allegedly violated MySQL's copyright by linking MySQL's GPL'ed code with NuSphere Gemini table without being in compliance with the license. After a preliminary hearing before Judge Patti Saris on 27 February 2002, the parties entered settlement talks and eventually settled.[82] After the hearing, FSF commented that \"Judge Saris made clear that she sees the GNU GPL to be an enforceable and binding license.\"[83]\n\ndoc5801: North American Union. The SPP initiative was officially ended on August 2009 though the North American Leaders' Summit and most of the working groups set up under the initiative remain active. Several advocates of integration saw the SPP as being insufficient. One criticism was that the governments lacked a \"vision of what North America might become\" and as such did not provide the proper context that would allow the initiative to deal with barriers to deeper integration.[30]\n\ndoc1443873: GNU General Public License. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the FOSS domain.[7][116][9][10][11][117]\n\ndoc1443897: GNU General Public License. For the LGPLv3, GNU TLS maintainer Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos similarly argued, If we assume that its [the LGPLv3] primary goal is to be used by free software, then it blatantly fails that.,[178] after he re-licensed GNU TLS from LGPLv3 back to LGPLv2.1 due to license compatibility issues.[179][180]\n\ndoc28256: GNU/Linux naming controversy. \"Sadly, a kernel by itself gets you nowhere [...] Most of the tools used with linux are GNU software.\"[36]\n\ndoc1443793: GNU General Public License. According to Richard Stallman, the major change in GPLv2 was the \"Liberty or Death\" clause, as he calls it[18] \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Section 7. The section says that licensees may distribute a GPL-covered work only if they can satisfy all of the license's obligations, despite any other legal obligations they might have. In other words, the obligations of the license may not be severed due to conflicting obligations. This provision is intended to discourage any party from using a patent infringement claim or other litigation to impair users' freedom under the license.[18]\n\ndoc1443819: GNU General Public License. Many distributors of GPL'ed programs bundle the source code with the executables. An alternative method of satisfying the copyleft is to provide a written offer to provide the source code on a physical medium (such as a CD) upon request. In practice, many GPL'ed programs are distributed over the Internet, and the source code is made available over FTP or HTTP. For Internet distribution, this complies with the license.\n\ndoc28247: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Stallman's and the FSF's efforts to include \"GNU\" in the name started around 1994, but were reportedly mostly via private communications (such as the above-mentioned request to Debian) until 1996.[21][22] In May 1996, Stallman released Emacs 19.31 with the Autoconf system target \"linux\" changed to \"lignux\" (shortly thereafter changed to \"linux-gnu\" in emacs 19.32),[23][7] and included an essay \"Linux and the GNU system\"[24] suggesting that people use the terms \"Linux-based GNU system\" (or \"GNU/Linux system\" or \"Lignux\" for short). He later used \"GNU/Linux\" exclusively, and the essay was superseded by Stallman's 1997 essay, \"Linux and the GNU project\".[6]\n\ndoc1443791: GNU General Public License. Version 1 of the GNU GPL,[21] released on 25 February 1989,[22] prevented what were then the two main ways that software distributors restricted the freedoms that define free software. The first problem was that distributors may publish binary files only\u00e2\u20ac\u201dexecutable, but not readable or modifiable by humans. To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that copying and distributing copies or any portion of the program must also make the human-readable source code available under the same licensing terms.[23]\n\ndoc1276444: Director of National Intelligence. In September 2007, the Office of the DNI released \"Intelligence Community 100 Day & 500 Day Plans for Integration & Collaboration\". These plans include a series of initiatives designed to build the foundation for increased cooperation and reform of the U.S. Intelligence Community.[15]\n\ndoc1443798: GNU General Public License. It also adds a provision that \"strips\" Digital Rights Management (DRM) of its legal value, so people can break anything a court might recognize as DRM on GPL software without breaking laws like the DMCA.[30]\n\ndoc1443817: GNU General Public License. This requirement is known as copyleft. It earns its legal power from the use of copyright on software programs. Because a GPL work is copyrighted, a licensee has no right to redistribute it, not even in modified form (barring fair use), except under the terms of the license. One is only required to adhere to the terms of the GPL if one wishes to exercise rights normally restricted by copyright law, such as redistribution. Conversely, if one distributes copies of the work without abiding by the terms of the GPL (for instance, by keeping the source code secret), he or she can be sued by the original author under copyright law.\n\ndoc830585: \"Hello, World!\" program. The Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions provide the \"hello, world\" program through the apt packaging system; this allows users to simply type \"apt-get install hello\" for the program to be installed, along with any software dependencies. While of itself useless, it serves as a sanity check and a simple example to newcomers of how to install a package. It is significantly more useful for developers, however, as it provides an example of how to create a .deb package, either traditionally or using debhelper, and the version of hello used, GNU Hello, serves as an example of how to write a GNU program.[16]\n\ndoc2237139: Sustainable procurement. The GLA also stated that their policy was \"very much as a model for broader government procurement\" but this expectation was not fulfilled in the UK Government's Sustainable Procurement Action Plan, published on March 5, 2007.[20] The Action Plan, which incorporated answers to the Sustainable Procurement Task Force, was explicitly environment-oriented in approach (Ch 4.3) with wider social issues scarcely addressed.\n\ndoc2078478: General Permitted Development Order. The website www.legislation.gov.uk, which is delivered by the National Archives, provides the original (\"as made\") version of the GPDO 2015, but states that UK statutory instruments are not carried in their \"revised\" form on the website.\n\ndoc28265: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Since a long name such as GNU/X11/Apache/Linux/TeX/Perl/Python/FreeCiv becomes absurd, at some point you will have to set a threshold and omit the names of the many other secondary contributions. There is no one obvious right place to set the threshold, so wherever you set it, we won't argue against it ... But one name that cannot result from concerns of fairness and giving credit, not for any possible threshold level, is \"Linux\". It can't be fair to give all the credit to one secondary contribution (Linux) while omitting the principal contribution (GNU).\n\ndoc1443875: GNU General Public License. After the release of the GPLv3 in June 2007, adoption of this new GPL version was much discussed[119] and some projects decided against upgrading. For instance the Linux kernel,[14][47] MySQL,[120] BusyBox,[121][122] AdvFS,[123] Blender,[124][125] and VLC media player[126] decided against adopting GPLv3. On the other hand, in 2009, two years after the release of GPLv3, Google open-source programs office manager Chris DiBona reported that the number of open-source project licensed software that had moved from GPLv2 to GPLv3 was 50%, counting the projects hosted at Google Code.[11]\n\ndoc2437992: 34th G8 summit. The international alliance End Water Poverty reports that hopes of a breakthrough in the global sanitation and water crisis at the G8 summit were dashed as the G8 delivered a communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 largely devoid of concrete actions to help the 2.6 billion people lacking access to a safe toilet, and the 1.1 billion people lacking access to clean water. Instead of agreeing an action plan to tackle what a recent WaterAid report claims kills more children than any other single factor, G8 leaders were content to report on progress at the 2009 summit and take steps to implement the discredited 2003 G8 Evian Water Action Plan.\n\ndoc2307828: George Hotz. On July 16, 2014, Google hired Hotz to work in their software security auditing team called Project Zero, which \"hopes to find zero-day vulnerabilities before the NSA\".[37] Hotz worked in Project Zero for 5 months where he developed Qira - an open source program for dynamically analysing application binaries.[citation needed]\n\ndoc855029: Linux. Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked.[33] As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users weren't legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a \"complete Unix-compatible software system\" composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984.[34] Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.[35]\n\ndoc1102841: OpenOffice.org. Development of OpenOffice.org was sponsored primarily by Sun Microsystems, which used the code as the basis for subsequent versions of StarOffice. Developers who wished to contribute code were required to sign a Contributor Agreement[32][33] granting joint ownership of any contributions to Sun (and then Oracle), in support of the StarOffice business model.[34] This was controversial for many years.[23][35][36][37][38] An alternative Public Documentation Licence (PDL)[39] was also offered for documentation not intended for inclusion or integration into the project code base.[40]\n\ndoc1443826: GNU General Public License. The text of the GPL is itself copyrighted, and the copyright is held by the Free Software Foundation.\n\ndoc1443785: GNU General Public License. The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software.[7] The license was originally written by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition.[8] The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.\n\ndoc2095383: Central Intelligence Agency. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al-Qaeda operatives.[267]\n\ndoc681494: History of free and open-source software. After the development of the GNU GPLv3, as copyright holder of many pieces of the GNU system, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) software, the FSF updated most[citation needed] of the GNU programs' licenses from GPLv2 to GPLv3. Apple, a user of GCC, and a heavy user of both DRM and patents decided to switch the compiler in its Xcode IDE from GCC to Clang, another FOSS compiler,[58] but which is under a permissive license.[59] LWN speculated that Apple was motivated partly by a desire to avoid GPLv3.[58] The Samba project also switched to GPLv3, which Apple replaced in their software suite with a closed-source, proprietary software alternative.[60]\n\ndoc28252: GNU/Linux naming controversy. The FSF justifies the name \"GNU/Linux\" primarily on the grounds that the GNU project was specifically developing a complete system, of which they argue that the Linux kernel filled one of the final gaps;[32] the large number of GNU components and GNU source code used in such systems is a secondary argument:\n\ndoc1829929: Software patent. In April 2013, the German Parliament adopted a joint motion \"against the growing trend of patent offices to grant patents on software programs\".[14]\n\ndoc1443864: GNU General Public License. After six years of repeated complaints to Cisco by the FSF, claims by Cisco that they would correct, or were correcting, their compliance problems (not providing complete copies of all source code and their modifications), of repeated new violations being discovered and reported with more products, and lack of action by Linksys (a process described on the FSF blog as a \"five-years-running game of Whack-a-Mole\"[91]) the FSF took them to court.\n\ndoc942314: Creative Commons license. In February 2012 CC0 was submitted to Open Source Initiative (OSI) for their approval.[48]  However, controversy arose over its clause which excluded from the scope of the license any relevant patents held by the copyright holder. This clause was added with scientific data in mind rather than software, but some members of the OSI believed it could weaken users' defenses against software patents. As a result, Creative Commons withdrew their submission, and the license is not currently approved by the OSI.[45][49]\n\ndoc1389269: Podcast. The term was coined for the fifth season of the Gnu World Order by Klaatu in 2010, when the show declared itself \"the world's first oggcast\".[45] At the time, the show was one of the few that released only in free formats, with no MP3 feed as an option. This gave way to other shows using the term, with hosts gathering in the #oggcastplanet connect IRC channel on the Freenode network to compare notes.\n\ndoc681449: History of free and open-source software. The term was given a big boost at an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the \"Freeware Summit\" and later named the \"Open Source Summit\"[37], the event brought together the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski of Netscape, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, the confusion caused by the name free software was brought up. Tiemann argued for \"sourceware\" as a new term, while Raymond argued for \"open source\". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference that evening. Five days later, Raymond made the first public call to the free software community to adopt the new term.[38] The Open Source Initiative was formed shortly thereafter.[35] According to the OSI Richard Stallman initially flirted with the idea of adopting the open source term.[39] But as the enormous success of the open source term buried Stallman's free software term and his message on social values and computer users' freedom,[40][41][42] later Stallman and his FSF strongly objected the OSI's approach and terminology.[43] Due to the rejection of Stallman of the term open-source software, the FOSS ecosystem is being divided in its terminology, see also Alternative terms for free software. For example, a 2002 FOSS developer survey revealed that 32.6% associate themselves with OSS, 48% with free software, and 19.4% in between or undecided.[44] Stallman still maintained, however, that users of each term were allies in the fight against proprietary software.\n\ndoc1443871: GNU General Public License. It is possible to use the GPL for text documents instead of computer programs, or more generally for all kinds of media, if it is clear what constitutes the source code (defined as \"the preferred form of the work for making changes in it\").[109] For manuals and textbooks, though, the FSF recommends the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) instead, which it created for this purpose.[110] Nevertheless, the Debian developers recommended (in a resolution adopted in 2006) to license documentation for their project under the GPL, because of the incompatibility of the GFDL with the GPL (text licensed under the GFDL cannot be incorporated into GPL software).[111][112] Also, the FLOSS Manuals foundation, an organization devoted to creating manuals for free software, decided to eschew the GFDL in favor of the GPL for its texts in 2007.[113]\n\n"

The public consultation process was coordinated by the Free Software Foundation with assistance from Software Freedom Law Center, Free Software Foundation Europe,[31] and other free software groups.

In 1989, the first version of the GNU General Public License was published.[26] A slightly updated version 2 was published in 1991. In 1989, some GNU developers formed the company Cygnus Solutions.[27] The GNU project's kernel, later called \"GNU Hurd\", was continually delayed, but most other components were completed by 1991. Some of these, especially the GNU Compiler Collection, had become market leaders[clarification needed] in their own right. The GNU Debugger and GNU Emacs were also notable successes.\n\ndoc28253: GNU/Linux naming controversy. So if you were going to pick a name for the system based on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate single choice would be GNU. But we don't think that is the right way to consider the question. The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific software packages. [...] Many people have made major contributions to the free software in the system, and they all deserve credit. But the reason it is an integrated system\u2014and not just a collection of useful programs\u2014is because the GNU Project set out to make it one. We made a list of the programs needed to make a complete free system, and we systematically wrote, or found people to write, everything on the list.\n\ndoc681436: History of free and open-source software. In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to write a complete operating system free from constraints on use of its source code. Particular incidents that motivated this include a case where an annoying printer couldn't be fixed because the source code was withheld from users.[24] Stallman also published the GNU Manifesto in 1985 to outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of free software. Another probable inspiration for the GNU project and its manifesto was a disagreement between Stallman and Symbolics, Inc. over MIT's access to updates Symbolics had made to its Lisp machine, which was based on MIT code.[25] Soon after the launch, he[17] used[clarification needed] the existing term \"free software\" and founded the Free Software Foundation to promote the concept. The Free Software Definition was published in February 1986.\n\ndoc1443808: GNU General Public License. The final version of the license text was published on 29 June 2007.[52]\n\ndoc1443825: GNU General Public License. In April 2017 a US federal court ruled that an open-source license is an enforceable contract.[64]\n\ndoc1443893: GNU General Public License. In 2009 David Chisnall described in an InformIT article, \"The Failure of the GPL\", the problems with the GPL, among them incompatibility and complexity of the license text.[174]\n\ndoc1443790: GNU General Public License.

The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc28263: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Regarding suggestions that renaming efforts stem from egotism or personal pique, Stallman has responded that his interest is not in giving credit to himself but to the GNU Project: \"Some people think that it's because I want my ego to be fed. Of course, I'm not asking you to call it 'Stallmanix'.\"[47] Stallman has admitted to irritation, although he believes it to be justified in response to seeing \"an idealistic project stymied and made ineffective, because people don't usually give it the credit for what it has done,\" concluding \"If you're an idealist like me, that can ruin your whole decade.\"[48]\n\ndoc1443796: GNU General Public License. In late 2005, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) announced work on version 3 of the GPL (GPLv3). On 16 January 2006, the first \"discussion draft\" of GPLv3 was published, and the public consultation began. The public consultation was originally planned for nine to fifteen months but finally stretched to eighteen months with four drafts being published. The official GPLv3 was released by FSF on 29 June 2007. GPLv3 was written by Richard Stallman, with legal counsel from Eben Moglen and Richard Fontana from the Software Freedom Law Center.[26][27][28]\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1443895: GNU General Public License. Already in September 2006, in the draft process of the GPLv3, several high-profile developers of the Linux kernel, for instance Linus Torvalds, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Andrew Morton, warned on a splitting of the FOSS community: the release of GPLv3 portends the Balkanisation of the entire Open Source Universe upon which we rely.[44] Similarly Benjamin Mako Hill argued in 2006 on the GPLv3 draft, noting that a united, collaborating community is more important than a single license.[176]\n\ndoc1443801: GNU General Public License. The third draft was released on 28 March 2007.[37] This draft included language intended to prevent patent-related agreements such as the controversial Microsoft-Novell patent agreement and restricts the anti-tivoization clauses to a legal definition of a \"User\" or \"consumer product\". It also explicitly removed the section on \"Geographical Limitations\", whose probable removal had been announced at the launch of the public consultation.\n\ndoc28244: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc1443854: GNU General Public License. The first known violation of the GPL was in 1989, when NeXT extended the GCC compiler to support Objective-C, but did not publicly release the changes.[80] After an inquiry they created a public patch. There was no lawsuit filed for this violation.[81]\n\ndoc1443797: GNU General Public License. According to Stallman, the most important changes are in relation to software patents, free software license compatibility, the definition of \"source code\", and hardware restrictions on software modification (\"tivoization\").[26][29] Other changes relate to internationalization, how license violations are handled, and how additional permissions can be granted by the copyright holder.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories. The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.[1]\n\ndoc1443898: GNU General Public License. Lawrence Rosen, attorney and computer specialist, praised in 2007 how the community using the Apache license were now able to work together with the GPL community in a compatible manner, as the problems of GPLv2 compatibility with Apache licensed software were resolved with the GPLv3. He said, I predict that one of the biggest success stories of GPLv3 will be the realization that the entire universe of free and open source software can thus be combined into comprehensive open source solutions for customers worldwide.[181]\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443892: GNU General Public License. In 2007 Allison Randal, who took part in the GPL draft committee, criticized the GPLv3 for being incompatible with the GPLv2[171] and for missing clarity in the formulation.[172] Similarly, Whurley prophesised in 2007 the downfall of the GPL due to the lack of focus for the developers with GPLv3 which would drive them towards permissive licenses.[173]\n\ndoc2183008: Politics of South Africa. The Government of National Unity (GNU) established under the interim constitution ostensibly remained in effect until the 1999 national elections. The parties originally comprising the GNU \u2013 the African National Congress (ANC), the National Party (NP), and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) \u2013 shared executive power. On 30 June 1996, the NP withdrew from the GNU to become part of the opposition.\n\ndoc28280: GNU/Linux naming controversy. There are lots of people on this bus; I don't hear a clamor of support that GNU is more essential than many of the other components; can't take a wheel away, and end up with a functional vehicle, or an engine, or the seats. I recommend you be happy we have a bus.[57]\n\ndoc1443804: GNU General Public License. This aims to make future such deals ineffective. The license is also meant to cause Microsoft to extend the patent licenses it grants to Novell customers for the use of GPLv3 software to all users of that GPLv3 software; this is possible only if Microsoft is legally a \"conveyor\" of the GPLv3 software.[39][40]\n\ndoc1443885: GNU General Public License. In 2001 the term received broader public attention when Craig Mundie, Microsoft Senior Vice President, described the GPL as being \"viral\".[156] Mundie argues that the GPL has a \"viral\" effect in that it only allows the conveyance of whole programs, which means programs that link to GPL libraries must themselves be under a GPL-compatible license, else they cannot be combined and distributed.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc28248: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Modern free software and Open-source software systems are composed of software by many different authors, including the Linux kernel developers, the GNU project, and other vendors such as those behind the X Window System. Desktop- and server-based distributions use GNU components such as the GNU C Library (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (Coreutils), and bash.\n\ndoc1443789: GNU General Public License. The second version of the license, version 2, was released in 1991. Over the following 15 years, members of the free software community became concerned over problems in the GPLv2 license that could let someone exploit GPL-licensed software in ways contrary to the license's intent.[19] These problems included tivoization (the inclusion of GPL-licensed software in hardware that refuses to run modified versions of its software), compatibility issues similar to those of the Affero General Public License\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand patent deals between Microsoft and distributors of free and open source software, which some viewed as an attempt to use patents as a weapon against the free software community.\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\ndoc1443891: GNU General Public License. In 2005, open source software advocate Eric S. Raymond questioned the relevance of GPL at that point in time for the FOSS ecosystem, stating: \"We don't need the GPL anymore. It's based on the belief that open source software is weak and needs to be protected. Open source would be succeeding faster if the GPL didn't make lots of people nervous about adopting it.\".[169] Richard Stallman replied that: \"GPL is designed to [...] ensure that every user of a program gets the essential freedoms\u2014to run it, to study and change the source code, to redistribute copies, and to publish modified versions\u00a0... [Raymond] addresses the issue in terms of different goals and values\u2014those of \"open source,\" which do not include defending software users' freedom to share and change software.\"[170]\n\ndoc1443880: GNU General Public License. A March 2015 analysis of the GitHub repositories revealed, for the GPL license family, a usage percentage of approx. 25% among licensed projects.[140] In June 2016 an analysis of Fedora Project's packages revealed the GNU GPL version 2 or later as the most popular license, and the GNU GPL family as the most popular license family (followed by the MIT, BSD, and GNU LGPL families).[141]\n\ndoc28278: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Others have suggested that, regardless of the merits, Stallman's persistence in what sometimes seems a lost cause makes him and GNU look bad. For example, Larry McVoy (author of BitKeeper, once used to manage Linux kernel development) opined that \"claiming credit only makes one look foolish and greedy\".[56]\n\ndoc1443894: GNU General Public License. In 2014 dtrace developer and Joyent CTO Bryan Cantrill called the copyleft GPL a \"Corporate Open Source Anti-pattern\" by being \"anti-collaborative\" and recommended instead permissive software licenses.[175]\n\ndoc1443806: GNU General Public License. Others, notably some high-profile developers of the Linux kernel, for instance Linus Torvalds, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Andrew Morton, commented to the mass media and made public statements about their objections to parts of discussion drafts 1 and 2.[44] The kernel developers referred to GPLv3 draft clauses regarding DRM/Tivoization, patents and \"additional restrictions\" and warned a Balkanisation of the \"Open Source Universe\".[44][45] Linus Torvalds, who decided to not adopt the GPLv3 for the Linux kernel,[14] reiterated his criticism even years later.[46][47]\n\ndoc1443878: GNU General Public License. In August 2013, according to Black Duck Software, the website's data shows that the GPL license family is used by 54% of open-source projects, with a breakdown of the individual licenses shown in the following table.[117] However, a later study in 2013 showed that software licensed under the GPL license family has increased, and that even the data from Black Duck Software has shown a total increase of software projects licensed under GPL. The study used public information gathered from repositories of the Debian Project, and the study criticized Black Duck Software for not publishing their methodology used in collecting statistics.[134] Daniel German, Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria in Canada, presented a talk in 2013 about the methodological challenges in determining which are the most widely used free software licenses, and showed how he could not replicate the result from Black Duck Software.[135]\n\ndoc1443786: GNU General Public License. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain.[7][9][10][11][12] Prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community.[13]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc1443858: GNU General Public License. This exactly mirrored the predictions given previously by the FSF's Eben Moglen. This ruling was important because it was the first time that a court had confirmed that violating terms of the GPL could be a copyright violation and established jurisprudence as to the enforceability of the GPL version 2 under German law.[85]\n\ndoc2608811: The Free Software Definition. In 1996, when the gnu.org website was launched, \"free software\" was defined referring to \"three levels of freedom\" by adding an explicit mention of the freedom to study the software (which could be read in the two-point definition as being part of the freedom to change the program).[4][5]  Stallman later avoided the word \"levels\", saying that you need all of the freedoms, so it's misleading to think in terms of levels.\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc1443802: GNU General Public License. The fourth discussion draft,[38] which was the last, was released on 31 May 2007. It introduced Apache License version 2.0 compatibility (prior versions are incompatible), clarified the role of outside contractors, and made an exception to avoid the perceived problems of a Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u201cNovell style agreement, saying in Section 11 paragraph 6 that:\n\ndoc979494: Compiler. Other Ada compiler efforts got under way in Britain at University of York and in Germany at University of Karlsruhe. In the U. S., Verdix (later acquired by Rational) delivered the Verdix Ada Development System (VADS) to the Army. VADS provided a set of development tools including a compiler. Unix/VADS could be hosted on a variety of Unix platforms such as DEC Ultrix and the Sun 3/60 Solaris targeted to Motorola 68020 in an Army CECOM evaluation.[33] There were soon many Ada compilers available that passed the Ada Validation tests. The Freesoftware Foundation GNU project developed the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) which provides a core capability to support multiple languages and targets. The Ada version GNAT is one of the most widely used Ada compilers. GNAT is free but there is also commercial support, for example, AdaCore, was founded in 1994 to provide commercial software solutions for Ada. GNAT Pro includes the GNU GCC based GNAT with a tool suite to provide an integrated development environment.\n\ndoc1443856: GNU General Public License. In August 2003, the SCO Group stated that they believed the GPL to have no legal validity, and that they intended to pursue lawsuits over sections of code supposedly copied from SCO Unix into the Linux kernel. This was a problematic stand for them, as they had distributed Linux and other GPL'ed code in their Caldera OpenLinux distribution, and there is little evidence that they had any legal right to do so except under the terms of the GPL.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443845: GNU General Public License. As a case study, some supposedly proprietary plugins and themes/skins for GPLv2 CMS software such as Drupal and WordPress have come under fire, with both sides of the argument taken.[76][77]\n\ndoc1443865: GNU General Public License. Cisco settled the case six months later by agreeing \"to appoint a Free Software Director for Linksys\" to ensure compliance, \"to notify previous recipients of Linksys products containing FSF programs of their rights under the GPL,\" to make source code of FSF programs freely available on its website, and to make a monetary contribution to the FSF.[92]\n\ndoc1443834: GNU General Public License. Richard Stallman and the FSF specifically encourage library-writers to license under the GPL so that proprietary programs cannot use the libraries, in an effort to protect the free-software world by giving it more tools than the proprietary world.[70]\n\ndoc705170: Open-source software. The Open Source Initiative's (OSI) definition is recognized by governments internationally[22] as the standard or de facto definition. In addition, many of the world's largest open source software projects and contributors, including Debian, Drupal Association, FreeBSD Foundation, Linux Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Wikimedia Foundation, Wordpress Foundation have committed[23] to upholding the OSI's mission and Open Source Definition through the OSI Affiliate Agreement.[24]\n\ndoc1443866: GNU General Public License. In 2011 it was noticed that GNU Emacs had been accidentally releasing some binaries without corresponding source code for two years, in opposition to the intended spirit of the GPL, resulting in a copyright violation.[93][94][95] Richard Stallman described this incident as \"a very bad mistake\",[96] which was promptly fixed. Naturally, the FSF didn't sue any downstream redistributors who also unknowingly violated the GPL by distributing these binaries.\n\ndoc1298539: United States Global AIDS Coordinator. The mission of the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) is to lead the implementation of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the largest commitment ever by any nation for an international health initiative dedicated to a single disease.[1] Initiated in 2003, PEPFAR has been reauthorized three times. What began as an emergency response has since developed into one of the largest international health initiatives. PEPFAR has supported countries in the development of national health and information systems to support the fight of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and is collaborating with countries around the world to work towards epidemic control.\n\ndoc1520006: Heartbleed. The industry's collective response to the crisis was the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a multimillion-dollar project announced by the Linux Foundation on April 24, 2014 to provide funds to critical elements of the global information infrastructure.[183] The initiative intends to allow lead developers to work full-time on their projects and to pay for security audits, hardware and software infrastructure, travel, and other expenses.[184] OpenSSL is a candidate to become the first recipient of the initiative's funding.[183]\n\ndoc1443814: GNU General Public License. In purely private (or internal) use\u2014with no sales and no distribution\u2014the software code may be modified and parts reused without requiring the source code to be released. For sales or distribution, the entire source code need to be made available to end users, including any code changes and additions\u2014in that case, copyleft is applied to ensure that end users retain the freedoms defined above.[55]\n\ndoc1443886: GNU General Public License. In 2006 Richard Stallman responded in an interview that Mundie's metaphor of a \"virus\" is wrong as software under the GPL does not \"attack\" or \"infect\" other software. Stallman believes that comparing the GPL to a virus is an extremely unfriendly thing to say, and that a better metaphor for software under the GPL would be a spider plant: If one takes a piece of it and puts it somewhere else, it grows there too.[157][158][159]\n\ndoc1443859: GNU General Public License. In May 2005, Daniel Wallace filed suit against the Free Software Foundation in the Southern District of Indiana, contending that the GPL is an illegal attempt to fix prices (at zero). The suit was dismissed in March 2006, on the grounds that Wallace had failed to state a valid anti-trust claim; the court noted that \"the GPL encourages, rather than discourages, free competition and the distribution of computer operating systems, the benefits of which directly pass to consumers\".[86] Wallace was denied the possibility of further amending his complaint, and was ordered to pay the FSF's legal expenses.\n\ndoc28262: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Because of this confusion, legal threats and public relations campaigns apparently directed against the kernel, such as those launched by the SCO Group or the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI), have been misinterpreted by many commentators who assume that the whole operating system is being targeted. SCO and the AdTI have even been accused of deliberately exploiting this confusion.[44][45][46]\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443887: GNU General Public License. On the other hand, the concept of a viral nature of the GPL was taken up by others later too.[160][161][162][163] For instance in 2008 the California Western School of Law characterized the GPL as: The GPL license is \u2018viral,\u2019 meaning any derivative work you create containing even the smallest portion of the previously GPL licensed software must also be licensed under the GPL license.[164]\n\ndoc1443862: GNU General Public License. In late 2007, the BusyBox developers and the Software Freedom Law Center embarked upon a program to gain GPL compliance from distributors of BusyBox in embedded systems, suing those who would not comply. These were claimed to be the first US uses of courts for enforcement of GPL obligations. See BusyBox GPL lawsuits.\n\ndoc28246: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Over the next few years, several suggestions arose for naming operating systems using the Linux kernel and GNU components. In 1992, the Yggdrasil Linux distribution adopted the name \"Linux/GNU/X\". In Usenet and mailing-list discussions, one can find usages of \"GNU/Linux\" as early as 1992[13] and of \"GNU+Linux\" as early as 1993.[14] The Debian project, which was at one time sponsored by the Free Software Foundation, switched to calling its product \"Debian GNU/Linux\" in early 1994;[3][15][16][17] This change followed a request by Richard Stallman (who initially proposed \"LiGNUx,\" but suggested \"GNU/Linux\" instead after hearing complaints about the awkwardness of the former term).[18] GNU's June 1994 Bulletin describes \"Linux\" as a \"free Unix system for 386 machines\" (with \"many of the utilities and libraries\" from GNU),[19] but the January 1995 Bulletin switched to the term \"GNU/Linux\" instead.[20]\n\ndoc1443821: GNU General Public License. There has been debate on whether it is a violation of the GPL to release the source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The consensus was that while unethical, it was not considered a violation. The issue was clarified when the license was altered with v2 to require that the \"preferred\" version of the source code be made available.[59]\n\ndoc1443800: GNU General Public License. During the public consultation process, 962 comments were submitted for the first draft.[33] By the end, a total of 2,636 comments had been submitted.[34][35][36]\n\ndoc705179: Open-source software. In his 1997 essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar,[40] open-source evangelist Eric S. Raymond suggests a model for developing OSS known as the bazaar model. Raymond likens the development of software by traditional methodologies to building a cathedral, \"carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation\".[40] He suggests that all software should be developed using the bazaar style, which he described as \"a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches.\"[40]\n\ndoc987926: Recursion. Recursive acronyms can also be examples of recursive humor. PHP, for example, stands for \"PHP Hypertext Preprocessor\", WINE stands for \"WINE Is Not an Emulator.\" and GNU stands for \"GNU's not Unix\".\n\ndoc1443888: GNU General Public License. The FreeBSD project has stated that a less publicized and unintended use of the GPL is that it is very favorable to large companies that want to undercut software companies. In other words, the GPL is well suited for use as a marketing weapon, potentially reducing overall economic benefit and contributing to monopolistic behavior and that the GPL can present a real problem for those wishing to commercialize and profit from software.[165]\n\ndoc1443855: GNU General Public License. In 2002, MySQL AB sued Progress NuSphere for copyright and trademark infringement in United States district court. NuSphere had allegedly violated MySQL's copyright by linking MySQL's GPL'ed code with NuSphere Gemini table without being in compliance with the license. After a preliminary hearing before Judge Patti Saris on 27 February 2002, the parties entered settlement talks and eventually settled.[82] After the hearing, FSF commented that \"Judge Saris made clear that she sees the GNU GPL to be an enforceable and binding license.\"[83]\n\ndoc5801: North American Union. The SPP initiative was officially ended on August 2009 though the North American Leaders' Summit and most of the working groups set up under the initiative remain active. Several advocates of integration saw the SPP as being insufficient. One criticism was that the governments lacked a \"vision of what North America might become\" and as such did not provide the proper context that would allow the initiative to deal with barriers to deeper integration.[30]\n\ndoc1443873: GNU General Public License. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the FOSS domain.[7][116][9][10][11][117]\n\ndoc1443897: GNU General Public License. For the LGPLv3, GNU TLS maintainer Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos similarly argued, If we assume that its [the LGPLv3] primary goal is to be used by free software, then it blatantly fails that.,[178] after he re-licensed GNU TLS from LGPLv3 back to LGPLv2.1 due to license compatibility issues.[179][180]\n\ndoc28256: GNU/Linux naming controversy. \"Sadly, a kernel by itself gets you nowhere [...] Most of the tools used with linux are GNU software.\"[36]\n\ndoc1443793: GNU General Public License. According to Richard Stallman, the major change in GPLv2 was the \"Liberty or Death\" clause, as he calls it[18] \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Section 7. The section says that licensees may distribute a GPL-covered work only if they can satisfy all of the license's obligations, despite any other legal obligations they might have. In other words, the obligations of the license may not be severed due to conflicting obligations. This provision is intended to discourage any party from using a patent infringement claim or other litigation to impair users' freedom under the license.[18]\n\ndoc1443819: GNU General Public License. Many distributors of GPL'ed programs bundle the source code with the executables. An alternative method of satisfying the copyleft is to provide a written offer to provide the source code on a physical medium (such as a CD) upon request. In practice, many GPL'ed programs are distributed over the Internet, and the source code is made available over FTP or HTTP. For Internet distribution, this complies with the license.\n\ndoc28247: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Stallman's and the FSF's efforts to include \"GNU\" in the name started around 1994, but were reportedly mostly via private communications (such as the above-mentioned request to Debian) until 1996.[21][22] In May 1996, Stallman released Emacs 19.31 with the Autoconf system target \"linux\" changed to \"lignux\" (shortly thereafter changed to \"linux-gnu\" in emacs 19.32),[23][7] and included an essay \"Linux and the GNU system\"[24] suggesting that people use the terms \"Linux-based GNU system\" (or \"GNU/Linux system\" or \"Lignux\" for short). He later used \"GNU/Linux\" exclusively, and the essay was superseded by Stallman's 1997 essay, \"Linux and the GNU project\".[6]\n\ndoc1443791: GNU General Public License. Version 1 of the GNU GPL,[21] released on 25 February 1989,[22] prevented what were then the two main ways that software distributors restricted the freedoms that define free software. The first problem was that distributors may publish binary files only\u00e2\u20ac\u201dexecutable, but not readable or modifiable by humans. To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that copying and distributing copies or any portion of the program must also make the human-readable source code available under the same licensing terms.[23]\n\ndoc1276444: Director of National Intelligence. In September 2007, the Office of the DNI released \"Intelligence Community 100 Day & 500 Day Plans for Integration & Collaboration\". These plans include a series of initiatives designed to build the foundation for increased cooperation and reform of the U.S. Intelligence Community.[15]\n\ndoc1443798: GNU General Public License. It also adds a provision that \"strips\" Digital Rights Management (DRM) of its legal value, so people can break anything a court might recognize as DRM on GPL software without breaking laws like the DMCA.[30]\n\ndoc1443817: GNU General Public License. This requirement is known as copyleft. It earns its legal power from the use of copyright on software programs. Because a GPL work is copyrighted, a licensee has no right to redistribute it, not even in modified form (barring fair use), except under the terms of the license. One is only required to adhere to the terms of the GPL if one wishes to exercise rights normally restricted by copyright law, such as redistribution. Conversely, if one distributes copies of the work without abiding by the terms of the GPL (for instance, by keeping the source code secret), he or she can be sued by the original author under copyright law.\n\ndoc830585: \"Hello, World!\" program. The Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions provide the \"hello, world\" program through the apt packaging system; this allows users to simply type \"apt-get install hello\" for the program to be installed, along with any software dependencies. While of itself useless, it serves as a sanity check and a simple example to newcomers of how to install a package. It is significantly more useful for developers, however, as it provides an example of how to create a .deb package, either traditionally or using debhelper, and the version of hello used, GNU Hello, serves as an example of how to write a GNU program.[16]\n\ndoc2237139: Sustainable procurement. The GLA also stated that their policy was \"very much as a model for broader government procurement\" but this expectation was not fulfilled in the UK Government's Sustainable Procurement Action Plan, published on March 5, 2007.[20] The Action Plan, which incorporated answers to the Sustainable Procurement Task Force, was explicitly environment-oriented in approach (Ch 4.3) with wider social issues scarcely addressed.\n\ndoc2078478: General Permitted Development Order. The website www.legislation.gov.uk, which is delivered by the National Archives, provides the original (\"as made\") version of the GPDO 2015, but states that UK statutory instruments are not carried in their \"revised\" form on the website.\n\ndoc28265: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Since a long name such as GNU/X11/Apache/Linux/TeX/Perl/Python/FreeCiv becomes absurd, at some point you will have to set a threshold and omit the names of the many other secondary contributions. There is no one obvious right place to set the threshold, so wherever you set it, we won't argue against it ... But one name that cannot result from concerns of fairness and giving credit, not for any possible threshold level, is \"Linux\". It can't be fair to give all the credit to one secondary contribution (Linux) while omitting the principal contribution (GNU).\n\ndoc1443875: GNU General Public License. After the release of the GPLv3 in June 2007, adoption of this new GPL version was much discussed[119] and some projects decided against upgrading. For instance the Linux kernel,[14][47] MySQL,[120] BusyBox,[121][122] AdvFS,[123] Blender,[124][125] and VLC media player[126] decided against adopting GPLv3. On the other hand, in 2009, two years after the release of GPLv3, Google open-source programs office manager Chris DiBona reported that the number of open-source project licensed software that had moved from GPLv2 to GPLv3 was 50%, counting the projects hosted at Google Code.[11]\n\ndoc2437992: 34th G8 summit. The international alliance End Water Poverty reports that hopes of a breakthrough in the global sanitation and water crisis at the G8 summit were dashed as the G8 delivered a communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 largely devoid of concrete actions to help the 2.6 billion people lacking access to a safe toilet, and the 1.1 billion people lacking access to clean water. Instead of agreeing an action plan to tackle what a recent WaterAid report claims kills more children than any other single factor, G8 leaders were content to report on progress at the 2009 summit and take steps to implement the discredited 2003 G8 Evian Water Action Plan.\n\ndoc2307828: George Hotz. On July 16, 2014, Google hired Hotz to work in their software security auditing team called Project Zero, which \"hopes to find zero-day vulnerabilities before the NSA\".[37] Hotz worked in Project Zero for 5 months where he developed Qira - an open source program for dynamically analysing application binaries.[citation needed]\n\ndoc855029: Linux. Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked.[33] As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users weren't legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a \"complete Unix-compatible software system\" composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984.[34] Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.[35]\n\ndoc1102841: OpenOffice.org. Development of OpenOffice.org was sponsored primarily by Sun Microsystems, which used the code as the basis for subsequent versions of StarOffice. Developers who wished to contribute code were required to sign a Contributor Agreement[32][33] granting joint ownership of any contributions to Sun (and then Oracle), in support of the StarOffice business model.[34] This was controversial for many years.[23][35][36][37][38] An alternative Public Documentation Licence (PDL)[39] was also offered for documentation not intended for inclusion or integration into the project code base.[40]\n\ndoc1443826: GNU General Public License. The text of the GPL is itself copyrighted, and the copyright is held by the Free Software Foundation.\n\ndoc1443785: GNU General Public License. The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software.[7] The license was originally written by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition.[8] The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.\n\ndoc2095383: Central Intelligence Agency. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al-Qaeda operatives.[267]\n\ndoc681494: History of free and open-source software. After the development of the GNU GPLv3, as copyright holder of many pieces of the GNU system, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) software, the FSF updated most[citation needed] of the GNU programs' licenses from GPLv2 to GPLv3. Apple, a user of GCC, and a heavy user of both DRM and patents decided to switch the compiler in its Xcode IDE from GCC to Clang, another FOSS compiler,[58] but which is under a permissive license.[59] LWN speculated that Apple was motivated partly by a desire to avoid GPLv3.[58] The Samba project also switched to GPLv3, which Apple replaced in their software suite with a closed-source, proprietary software alternative.[60]\n\ndoc28252: GNU/Linux naming controversy. The FSF justifies the name \"GNU/Linux\" primarily on the grounds that the GNU project was specifically developing a complete system, of which they argue that the Linux kernel filled one of the final gaps;[32] the large number of GNU components and GNU source code used in such systems is a secondary argument:\n\ndoc1829929: Software patent. In April 2013, the German Parliament adopted a joint motion \"against the growing trend of patent offices to grant patents on software programs\".[14]\n\ndoc1443864: GNU General Public License. After six years of repeated complaints to Cisco by the FSF, claims by Cisco that they would correct, or were correcting, their compliance problems (not providing complete copies of all source code and their modifications), of repeated new violations being discovered and reported with more products, and lack of action by Linksys (a process described on the FSF blog as a \"five-years-running game of Whack-a-Mole\"[91]) the FSF took them to court.\n\ndoc942314: Creative Commons license. In February 2012 CC0 was submitted to Open Source Initiative (OSI) for their approval.[48]  However, controversy arose over its clause which excluded from the scope of the license any relevant patents held by the copyright holder. This clause was added with scientific data in mind rather than software, but some members of the OSI believed it could weaken users' defenses against software patents. As a result, Creative Commons withdrew their submission, and the license is not currently approved by the OSI.[45][49]\n\ndoc1389269: Podcast. The term was coined for the fifth season of the Gnu World Order by Klaatu in 2010, when the show declared itself \"the world's first oggcast\".[45] At the time, the show was one of the few that released only in free formats, with no MP3 feed as an option. This gave way to other shows using the term, with hosts gathering in the #oggcastplanet connect IRC channel on the Freenode network to compare notes.\n\ndoc681449: History of free and open-source software. The term was given a big boost at an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the \"Freeware Summit\" and later named the \"Open Source Summit\"[37], the event brought together the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski of Netscape, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, the confusion caused by the name free software was brought up. Tiemann argued for \"sourceware\" as a new term, while Raymond argued for \"open source\". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference that evening. Five days later, Raymond made the first public call to the free software community to adopt the new term.[38] The Open Source Initiative was formed shortly thereafter.[35] According to the OSI Richard Stallman initially flirted with the idea of adopting the open source term.[39] But as the enormous success of the open source term buried Stallman's free software term and his message on social values and computer users' freedom,[40][41][42] later Stallman and his FSF strongly objected the OSI's approach and terminology.[43] Due to the rejection of Stallman of the term open-source software, the FOSS ecosystem is being divided in its terminology, see also Alternative terms for free software. For example, a 2002 FOSS developer survey revealed that 32.6% associate themselves with OSS, 48% with free software, and 19.4% in between or undecided.[44] Stallman still maintained, however, that users of each term were allies in the fight against proprietary software.\n\ndoc1443871: GNU General Public License. It is possible to use the GPL for text documents instead of computer programs, or more generally for all kinds of media, if it is clear what constitutes the source code (defined as \"the preferred form of the work for making changes in it\").[109] For manuals and textbooks, though, the FSF recommends the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) instead, which it created for this purpose.[110] Nevertheless, the Debian developers recommended (in a resolution adopted in 2006) to license documentation for their project under the GPL, because of the incompatibility of the GFDL with the GPL (text licensed under the GFDL cannot be incorporated into GPL software).[111][112] Also, the FLOSS Manuals foundation, an organization devoted to creating manuals for free software, decided to eschew the GFDL in favor of the GPL for its texts in 2007.[113]\n\n"
