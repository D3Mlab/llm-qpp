The first petition was supported by Family First New Zealand, the ACT Party[28] and The Kiwi Party.[26]\n\ndoc38354: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The law change has been described by supporters as aimed at making 'Aotearoa New Zealand [\u2026] a place where children are secure, confident, understand limits and boundaries and behave well \u2013 without physical punishment' and to 'protect children from assault'.[14]\n\ndoc38340: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. A citizens-initiated referendum on the issues surrounding the law was held between 30 July and 21 August 2009, asking \"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\" Despite widespread criticism of the question's wording, the referendum was returned with an 87.4 percent \"No\" vote on a turnout of 56.1 percent.\n\ndoc38338: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007 (formerly the Crimes (Abolition of Force as a Justification for Child Discipline) Amendment Bill) is an amendment to New Zealand's Crimes Act 1961 which removed the legal defence of \"reasonable force\" for parents prosecuted for assault on their children.\n\ndoc2173071: New Zealand\u2013United Kingdom relations. A number of these acts were repealed through the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989.[10]\n\ndoc2300292: Sedition. Following a recommendation from the New Zealand Law Commission,[33] the New Zealand government announced on 7 May 2007 that the sedition law would be repealed.[34] The Crimes (Repeal of Seditious Offences) Amendment Act 2007 was passed on 24 October 2007, and entered into force on 1 January 2008.[35]\n\ndoc38368: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The referendum was non-binding (as specified by New Zealand's Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993), and thus does not compel the government to follow its result. Prime Minister John Key and Leader of the Opposition Phil Goff have said the results of the referendum will not commit them to repealing the law.[32]\n\ndoc806023: Gun laws in New Zealand. The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A large number of cases have been heard under the Act since it was passed in 1990, mostly pertaining to rights around arrest and detention.\n\ndoc805996: Gun laws in New Zealand. In March 2009 the New Zealand police bid to reclassify certain types of civilian semi-automatic firearms was overturned by the New Zealand High Court as a result of a legal challenge mounted by the New Zealand National Shooters Association (NSA) president Richard Lincoln.\n\n",

A citizens-initiated referendum on the issues surrounding the law was held between 30 July and 21 August 2009, asking \"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\" Despite widespread criticism of the question's wording, the referendum was returned with an 87.4 percent \"No\" vote on a turnout of 56.1 percent.\n\ndoc38364: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The first petition was supported by Family First New Zealand, the ACT Party[28] and The Kiwi Party.[26]\n\ndoc38354: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The law change has been described by supporters as aimed at making 'Aotearoa New Zealand [\u2026] a place where children are secure, confident, understand limits and boundaries and behave well \u2013 without physical punishment' and to 'protect children from assault'.[14]\n\ndoc76451: Politics of New Zealand. New Zealand law has three principal sources: English common law, certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689), and statutes of the New Zealand Parliament.[33] In interpreting common law, the courts have endeavoured to preserve uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions.[34]\n\ndoc2245156: Constitution of New Zealand. The Act provided:\n\ndoc40110: Legal issues in airsoft. Legislation, New Zealand, Arms Act 1983, retrieved 15 July 2014\u00c2\n\ndoc806022: Gun laws in New Zealand. The government decided to order another report, this time led by former judge Thomas Thorp. The report was released in 1997 and called for many new restrictions on legal gun ownership, including banning various features, and that all guns be registered (the last particularly unpopular with firearm owners).\n\ndoc7691: Convention on the Rights of the Child. In May 2007, New Zealand passed the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, which removed the defence of \"reasonable force\" for the purpose of correction. In its third and final vote, Parliament voted 113 to eight in favour of the legislation.[43]\n\ndoc466193: School corporal punishment. Corporal punishment in New Zealand schools was abolished in 1987, but wasn't abolished legislatively until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or ECE provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control.[108] Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in termination and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.[109]\n\ndoc806013: Gun laws in New Zealand. Firearms first arrived in New Zealand with European traders and were traded in large numbers to the native M\u0101ori. This lead partly to the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. The first gun control laws were enacted in 1845, but early regulations were ineffective until the passage of the Arms Act in 1860, which required licences and registration of firearms and firearm dealers. Early laws were mainly targeted at M\u0101ori during the land wars in the Waikato and Taranaki, and were largely suspended at the end of the 1880s. By about 1910 the laws were ignored and unenforced, as crime and the threat of political unrest were minimal.\n\ndoc1825622: Laws regarding incest. It is also illegal in New Zealand to have a sexual connection with a dependent child under 18; this includes step-children, foster children and wards. A conviction for having a sexual connection, or attempting to have a sexual connection, with a dependent child attracts a maximum penalty of 7 years' imprisonment.[96]\n\ndoc430018: History of New Zealand. \n\ndoc2145434: Law of New Zealand. Another problem with the idea that the Treaty established the rule of British law is that in 1840 M\ud6eeori still controlled New Zealand. Although the British had sent a governor, they had not backed him up with troops and for the first few years of supposed British sovereignty, Europeans were significantly outnumbered and outgunned by M\ud6eeori. M\ud6eeori generally obeyed British law in European settlements and when they or their chiefs chose to, but there was nothing to make them obey the law in areas they controlled, which until about the 1860s was most of the country. British law, and later New Zealand law as passed by the New Zealand parliament was slowly established over the country, but it remained ineffective in M\ud6eeori-controlled areas until the late nineteenth century at least. In practical terms, British-based law was established in New Zealand not through the Treaty of Waitangi but through conquest and settlement.\n\n"

The first petition was supported by Family First New Zealand, the ACT Party[28] and The Kiwi Party.[26]\n\ndoc38354: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The law change has been described by supporters as aimed at making 'Aotearoa New Zealand [\u2026] a place where children are secure, confident, understand limits and boundaries and behave well \u2013 without physical punishment' and to 'protect children from assault'.[14]\n\ndoc38340: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. A citizens-initiated referendum on the issues surrounding the law was held between 30 July and 21 August 2009, asking \"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\" Despite widespread criticism of the question's wording, the referendum was returned with an 87.4 percent \"No\" vote on a turnout of 56.1 percent.\n\ndoc38338: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007 (formerly the Crimes (Abolition of Force as a Justification for Child Discipline) Amendment Bill) is an amendment to New Zealand's Crimes Act 1961 which removed the legal defence of \"reasonable force\" for parents prosecuted for assault on their children.\n\ndoc2173071: New Zealand\u2013United Kingdom relations. A number of these acts were repealed through the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989.[10]\n\ndoc2300292: Sedition. Following a recommendation from the New Zealand Law Commission,[33] the New Zealand government announced on 7 May 2007 that the sedition law would be repealed.[34] The Crimes (Repeal of Seditious Offences) Amendment Act 2007 was passed on 24 October 2007, and entered into force on 1 January 2008.[35]\n\ndoc38368: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The referendum was non-binding (as specified by New Zealand's Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993), and thus does not compel the government to follow its result. Prime Minister John Key and Leader of the Opposition Phil Goff have said the results of the referendum will not commit them to repealing the law.[32]\n\ndoc806023: Gun laws in New Zealand. The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A large number of cases have been heard under the Act since it was passed in 1990, mostly pertaining to rights around arrest and detention.\n\ndoc805996: Gun laws in New Zealand. In March 2009 the New Zealand police bid to reclassify certain types of civilian semi-automatic firearms was overturned by the New Zealand High Court as a result of a legal challenge mounted by the New Zealand National Shooters Association (NSA) president Richard Lincoln.\n\n"

The first petition was supported by Family First New Zealand, the ACT Party[28] and The Kiwi Party.[26]\n\ndoc38354: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The law change has been described by supporters as aimed at making 'Aotearoa New Zealand [\u2026] a place where children are secure, confident, understand limits and boundaries and behave well \u2013 without physical punishment' and to 'protect children from assault'.[14]\n\ndoc38340: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. A citizens-initiated referendum on the issues surrounding the law was held between 30 July and 21 August 2009, asking \"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\" Despite widespread criticism of the question's wording, the referendum was returned with an 87.4 percent \"No\" vote on a turnout of 56.1 percent.\n\ndoc38338: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007 (formerly the Crimes (Abolition of Force as a Justification for Child Discipline) Amendment Bill) is an amendment to New Zealand's Crimes Act 1961 which removed the legal defence of \"reasonable force\" for parents prosecuted for assault on their children.\n\ndoc2173071: New Zealand\u2013United Kingdom relations. A number of these acts were repealed through the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989.[10]\n\ndoc2300292: Sedition. Following a recommendation from the New Zealand Law Commission,[33] the New Zealand government announced on 7 May 2007 that the sedition law would be repealed.[34] The Crimes (Repeal of Seditious Offences) Amendment Act 2007 was passed on 24 October 2007, and entered into force on 1 January 2008.[35]\n\ndoc38368: Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007. The referendum was non-binding (as specified by New Zealand's Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993), and thus does not compel the government to follow its result. Prime Minister John Key and Leader of the Opposition Phil Goff have said the results of the referendum will not commit them to repealing the law.[32]\n\ndoc806023: Gun laws in New Zealand. The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A large number of cases have been heard under the Act since it was passed in 1990, mostly pertaining to rights around arrest and detention.\n\ndoc805996: Gun laws in New Zealand. In March 2009 the New Zealand police bid to reclassify certain types of civilian semi-automatic firearms was overturned by the New Zealand High Court as a result of a legal challenge mounted by the New Zealand National Shooters Association (NSA) president Richard Lincoln.\n\n"

The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.

The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A large number of cases have been heard under the Act since it was passed in 1990, mostly pertaining to rights around arrest and detention.\n\ndoc805996: Gun laws in New Zealand. In March 2009 the New Zealand police bid to reclassify certain types of civilian semi-automatic firearms was overturned by the New Zealand High Court as a result of a legal challenge mounted by the New Zealand National Shooters Association (NSA) president Richard Lincoln.\n\n",

The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.

The report was released in 1997 and called for many new restrictions on legal gun ownership, including banning various features, and that all guns be registered (the last particularly unpopular with firearm owners).\n\ndoc7691: Convention on the Rights of the Child. In May 2007, New Zealand passed the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, which removed the defence of \"reasonable force\" for the purpose of correction. In its third and final vote, Parliament voted 113 to eight in favour of the legislation.[43]\n\ndoc466193: School corporal punishment. Corporal punishment in New Zealand schools was abolished in 1987, but wasn't abolished legislatively until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or ECE provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control.[108] Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in termination and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.[109]\n\ndoc806013: Gun laws in New Zealand. Firearms first arrived in New Zealand with European traders and were traded in large numbers to the native M\u0101ori. This lead partly to the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. The first gun control laws were enacted in 1845, but early regulations were ineffective until the passage of the Arms Act in 1860, which required licences and registration of firearms and firearm dealers. Early laws were mainly targeted at M\u0101ori during the land wars in the Waikato and Taranaki, and were largely suspended at the end of the 1880s. By about 1910 the laws were ignored and unenforced, as crime and the threat of political unrest were minimal.\n\ndoc1825622: Laws regarding incest. It is also illegal in New Zealand to have a sexual connection with a dependent child under 18; this includes step-children, foster children and wards. A conviction for having a sexual connection, or attempting to have a sexual connection, with a dependent child attracts a maximum penalty of 7 years' imprisonment.[96]\n\ndoc430018: History of New Zealand. \n\ndoc2145434: Law of New Zealand. Another problem with the idea that the Treaty established the rule of British law is that in 1840 M\ud6eeori still controlled New Zealand. Although the British had sent a governor, they had not backed him up with troops and for the first few years of supposed British sovereignty, Europeans were significantly outnumbered and outgunned by M\ud6eeori. M\ud6eeori generally obeyed British law in European settlements and when they or their chiefs chose to, but there was nothing to make them obey the law in areas they controlled, which until about the 1860s was most of the country. British law, and later New Zealand law as passed by the New Zealand parliament was slowly established over the country, but it remained ineffective in M\ud6eeori-controlled areas until the late nineteenth century at least. In practical terms, British-based law was established in New Zealand not through the Treaty of Waitangi but through conquest and settlement.\n\n"

The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\ndoc1862085: New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. A large number of cases have been heard under the Act since it was passed in 1990, mostly pertaining to rights around arrest and detention.\n\ndoc805996: Gun laws in New Zealand.

New Zealand law has three principal sources: English common law, certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689), and statutes of the New Zealand Parliament.[33] In interpreting common law, the courts have endeavoured to preserve uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions.[34]\n\ndoc2245156: Constitution of New Zealand. The Act provided:\n\ndoc40110: Legal issues in airsoft. Legislation, New Zealand, Arms Act 1983, retrieved 15 July 2014\u00c2\n\ndoc806022: Gun laws in New Zealand. The government decided to order another report, this time led by former judge Thomas Thorp. The report was released in 1997 and called for many new restrictions on legal gun ownership, including banning various features, and that all guns be registered (the last particularly unpopular with firearm owners).\n\ndoc7691: Convention on the Rights of the Child. In May 2007, New Zealand passed the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, which removed the defence of \"reasonable force\" for the purpose of correction. In its third and final vote, Parliament voted 113 to eight in favour of the legislation.[43]\n\ndoc466193: School corporal punishment. Corporal punishment in New Zealand schools was abolished in 1987, but wasn't abolished legislatively until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or ECE provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control.[108] Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in termination and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.[109]\n\ndoc806013: Gun laws in New Zealand. Firearms first arrived in New Zealand with European traders and were traded in large numbers to the native M\u0101ori. This lead partly to the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. The first gun control laws were enacted in 1845, but early regulations were ineffective until the passage of the Arms Act in 1860, which required licences and registration of firearms and firearm dealers. Early laws were mainly targeted at M\u0101ori during the land wars in the Waikato and Taranaki, and were largely suspended at the end of the 1880s. By about 1910 the laws were ignored and unenforced, as crime and the threat of political unrest were minimal.\n\ndoc1825622: Laws regarding incest. It is also illegal in New Zealand to have a sexual connection with a dependent child under 18; this includes step-children, foster children and wards. A conviction for having a sexual connection, or attempting to have a sexual connection, with a dependent child attracts a maximum penalty of 7 years' imprisonment.[96]\n\ndoc430018: History of New Zealand. \n\ndoc2145434: Law of New Zealand. Another problem with the idea that the Treaty established the rule of British law is that in 1840 M\ud6eeori still controlled New Zealand. Although the British had sent a governor, they had not backed him up with troops and for the first few years of supposed British sovereignty, Europeans were significantly outnumbered and outgunned by M\ud6eeori. M\ud6eeori generally obeyed British law in European settlements and when they or their chiefs chose to, but there was nothing to make them obey the law in areas they controlled, which until about the 1860s was most of the country. British law, and later New Zealand law as passed by the New Zealand parliament was slowly established over the country, but it remained ineffective in M\ud6eeori-controlled areas until the late nineteenth century at least. In practical terms, British-based law was established in New Zealand not through the Treaty of Waitangi but through conquest and settlement.\n\n"
