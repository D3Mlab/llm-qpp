I'm interested in knowing the primary filming locations as well as any secondary locations used for specific scenes.  Were there any challenges in filming in those locations, and how were they overcome?  Finally, I'd like to know if any of the filming locations were chosen to specifically reflect the setting of the story, and if so, how did they contribute to the film's overall atmosphere?\n",

I'm interested in the specific locations used for filming, including countries and cities, and whether any of these locations were chosen to reflect the story's setting in Saudi Arabia.  Were there any logistical challenges in filming in these locations, such as obtaining permits or dealing with weather conditions?  Additionally, I'd like to know if any scenes were filmed using holographic technology, and if so, what kind of technology was used and where was that filming done? Finally, what was the overall production timeline, including the start and end dates of principal photography in each location?\n"

Shooting wrapped in June 2014.[13][14]\n\ndoc20543: A Hologram for the King (film). On June 12, 2013, Tom Tykwer was reported to be developing an adaptation of 2012 novel A Hologram for the King, written by Dave Eggers. Tykwer wrote and directed the film, which stars Tom Hanks as the lead. The film was made by Playtone, Primeridian Entertainment, and X-Filme Creative Pool.[6] On September 5, 2013, Lotus Entertainment began licensing international rights to the film.[10] On March 6, 2014 it was announced that Sarita Choudhury, Alexander Black, Tracey Fairaway, David Menkin, and Tom Skerritt had joined the cast of the film.[11]\n\ndoc20542: A Hologram for the King (film). The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film). A Hologram for the King is a 2016 comedy-drama film directed, written and co-scored by Tom Tykwer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name written by Dave Eggers,[6][7] and starring Tom Hanks as a washed-up corporate salesman, who goes to Saudi Arabia to propose a business deal.\n\ndoc20541: A Hologram for the King (film). Sidse Babett Knudsen, Tom Skerritt and Sarita Choudhury also star in this international co-production between France, Germany, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, and the United States.[2] The film was released on April 22, 2016, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Saban Films. It received positive reviews but was a box-office flop, becoming the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc20545: A Hologram for the King (film). Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the movie \"a story of confusion, perplexity, frustration and panic,\" praising Tom Hanks's ability to turn it into \"an agreeably uncomfortable comedy,\" meriting a \"Critic's Pick\" designation.[15] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 73% based on 139 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A Hologram for the King amiably ambles through a narrative desert, saved by an oasis of a performance from the ever-dependable Tom Hanks.\"[16] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17]\n\ndoc20546: A Hologram for the King (film). The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office. With a total worldwide gross of $8,244,651 (U.S. domestic gross of $4,212,494), it is the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc1207958: King of Kings (1961 film). The production was photographed in Technirama by Manuel Berenguer, Milton R. Krasner and Franz Planer, and was presented in 70mm Super Technirama at selected first-run engagements.[2] It was the first film of the life of Christ to be presented in 70mm, which was not in use when previous films on the same subject had been made. The previous film version of Christ's life, a church-sponsored film called Day of Triumph, had been filmed in standard \"spherical\" widescreen in 1954 by much the same people who filmed television's The Living Christ Series.[3]\n\ndoc1224661: Holography. When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit parallax, in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\ndoc1224719: Holography.

Aside from establishing shots of iconic landmarks, the scenes in London were largely filmed in Prague, Czech Republic.[2][3]\n\ndoc2020827: The King and Four Queens. At Clark Gable's request, the film was shot on location in southern Utah because he was familiar with the area, having hunted there for years. Footage was shot near St. George, Utah in Snow Canyon State Park and at the Santa Clara River.[4] Additional footage was shot in Calabasas, California.\n\ndoc1311119: Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Filming took place at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The castle scenes were shot on location at Corfe Castle, Dorset, England.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2482107: In the Name of the King. The film was shot near the Municipality of Sooke, the westernmost area of the Greater Victoria, Capital Regional District (CRD), British Columbia. Locals and First Nations people were recruited as extras and for other duties.\n\ndoc2659232: Poovukkul. The first part of the film was shot at Paris, France. Later it was taken to Rome, Italy. Thirdly in New York City, United States. Fourthly in Giza, Egypt, and then Great Wall of China and lastly at Taj Mahal in India.\n\ndoc2016860: 28 Weeks Later. The on-location filming took place in London and 3 Mills Studios, although scenes intended to be shot at Wembley Stadium, then undergoing final stages of a major reconstruction, were filmed instead in Wales, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium used as a replacement.[11]\n\ndoc1004747: Heneral Luna. The film went through a long pre-production phase, which allowed the film's various departments to cope with the challenges of filming a period film in contemporary settings.[23]  With roughly 90% of the film needing to be shot on location, the film required extensive location shoots in the few areas in the Philippines which still matched the architecture and environment of the period.[26]\n\ndoc2457520: The House of the Spirits (film). Principal photography took place in Denmark, but some scenes were filmed in Lisbon and Alentejo, Portugal.\n\ndoc920754: The King's Speech. On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism.[13] Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.[16][17][18]\n\ndoc645291: King Kong (1933 film). In August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Path\u00c3\u00a9 lot in Culver City with the native huts recycled from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Wind's burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\n",

The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film). A Hologram for the King is a 2016 comedy-drama film directed, written and co-scored by Tom Tykwer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name written by Dave Eggers,[6][7] and starring Tom Hanks as a washed-up corporate salesman, who goes to Saudi Arabia to propose a business deal.\n\ndoc20541: A Hologram for the King (film).

The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office.

When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit parallax, in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\ndoc1224719: Holography.

The series began filming on May 3, 2017 in New York City[16] and it was expected that shooting would take place in a number of locations around the world.[17] Ultimately, the production lasted six months and sprawled across three continents and six countries.[5] Various places stood-in for the locales in which the story actually took place. For instance, scenes set in Yemen were filmed in Morocco, and drone and car travel shots of Pakistani landscapes were used to evoke Afghanistan. Johannesburg, South Africa served as the production base, and was where the bulk of filming took place. The city possessed the \"visual variety\" that the producers were seeking, and doubled for various places including Nairobi, Tanzania, England, Albania, and Las Vegas, Nevada.[9] While there was an initial push to shoot the production all in South Africa, Zisk argued for filming the back half in Morocco. In August 2017, filming took place at the River Caf\u00e9 in Brooklyn.[9]\n\ndoc204308: Lawrence of Arabia (film). The film was made by Horizon Pictures and Columbia Pictures. Principal photography began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 21 September 1962.[41]\n\ndoc2028816: At Play in the Fields of the Lord. The picture was filmed in Bel\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, Brazil. It was released to theaters in the U.S. on December 6, 1991. While the film has been released to VHS and Laserdisc, the film was never released on DVD nor Blu-ray anywhere (except for a 2013 DVD release in Spain). This is due to a rights issue with Universal Pictures (the distributor of the film) and Warner Bros. (current distributors of the Saul Zaentz library).\n\ndoc2192501: Morocco. Cinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of Le chevrier Marocain (\"The Moroccan Goatherd\") by Louis Lumi\u00e8re in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the Ouarzazate area.\n\ndoc2602904: Khuda Kay Liye. Principal photography of the film took place in Lahore, where most of the parts were filmed. Besides, the film was also shot at Chicago, London and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[10]\n\ndoc1920504: Knight and Day. Principal photography began in mid-September 2009 in Boston and Bridgewater, Massachusetts. Airport terminal scenes were filmed at Worcester Regional Airport. Filming also took place in Melrose, Danvers, and New Bedford, Massachusetts.[12] Spanish cities Seville and Cadiz, as well as Austrian city Salzburg, were also chosen as locations.[13]\n\ndoc363162: Harvard University. Harvard's policy since 1970 has been to permit filming on its property only rarely, so most scenes set at Harvard (especially indoor shots, but excepting aerial footage and shots of public areas such as Harvard Square) are in fact shot elsewhere.[144][145]\n\ndoc2486282: Cinema of Iran. Cinema was only five years old when it came to Fati Persia at the beginning of the 20th century. The first Persian filmmaker was Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi, the official photographer of Muzaffar al-Din Shah, the King of Persia from 1896\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1907. After a visit to Paris in July 1900, Akkas Bashi obtained a camera and filmed the Shah's visit to Europe upon the Shah's orders. He is said to have filmed the Shah's private and religious ceremonies, but no copies of such films exist today. A few years after Akkas Bashi started photography, Khan Baba Motazedi, another pioneer in Iranian motion picture photography emerged.[10] He shot a considerable amount of newsreel footage during the reign of Qajar to the Pahlavi dynasty.[11] The first public screening took place in Tehran in 1904, presented by Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahaf Bashi. He arranged the screening in the back of his antique shop. In 1905, Sahaf Bashi opened the first movie theater in Cheragh Gaz Avenue in the national capital. In 1909, with fall of the Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar heir of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and the success of the constitutionalists, Russi Khan lost his support. Consequently, his film theatre and photography studios were destroyed by the public. Soon after, other cinema theatres in Tehran closed down. Movie theatres sprang up again in 1912 with the help of Ardeshir Khan an Armenian -Iranian.[12] In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian decided to establish the first film school in Iran. In 1904, Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi opened the first movie theater in Tehran.[10] The cinematographic camera was introduced to Iran in 1929, as yet another tool of modernization. After Mirza Ebrahim Khan, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.[8] In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian, decided to establish the first film school in Iran. Within five years he managed to run the first session of the school under the name \"Parvareshgahe Artistiye Cinema\".[13]\n\ndoc260317: Culture of Saudi Arabia. During the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the kingdom although they were seen as contrary to tribal norms.[195] All cinemas and theaters were closed in 1980 as a political response to the Islamic revival and the increase in Islamist activism, most particularly the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As of 2014, with the exception of one IMAX theater in Khobar there are no cinemas in Saudi Arabia.[196] Many Saudis watch films via satellite, DVD, or video.\n\ndoc1584336: Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen was shot on location in London, Scotland, and Morocco. Scenes set in Yemen were filmed in Ouarzazate in the Moroccan Atlas Mountains.[14] The restaurant scene in London was filmed at the Oxo Tower. The Sheikh's house in Scotland was filmed at Ardverikie House.[15] Reshooting and water tank work was filmed at Black Hangar Studios in the UK. Principal photography started on 6 August 2010.[3]\n\n"

Production was set to begin in first quarter of 2014.[10] Principal photography commenced on March 6, 2014 in Morocco.[12] Filming also took place in Hurghada in Egypt, as well as in Berlin and D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany. Shooting wrapped in June 2014.[13][14]\n\ndoc20543: A Hologram for the King (film). On June 12, 2013, Tom Tykwer was reported to be developing an adaptation of 2012 novel A Hologram for the King, written by Dave Eggers. Tykwer wrote and directed the film, which stars Tom Hanks as the lead. The film was made by Playtone, Primeridian Entertainment, and X-Filme Creative Pool.[6] On September 5, 2013, Lotus Entertainment began licensing international rights to the film.[10] On March 6, 2014 it was announced that Sarita Choudhury, Alexander Black, Tracey Fairaway, David Menkin, and Tom Skerritt had joined the cast of the film.[11]\n\ndoc20542: A Hologram for the King (film). The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film). A Hologram for the King is a 2016 comedy-drama film directed, written and co-scored by Tom Tykwer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name written by Dave Eggers,[6][7] and starring Tom Hanks as a washed-up corporate salesman, who goes to Saudi Arabia to propose a business deal.\n\ndoc20541: A Hologram for the King (film). Sidse Babett Knudsen, Tom Skerritt and Sarita Choudhury also star in this international co-production between France, Germany, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, and the United States.[2] The film was released on April 22, 2016, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Saban Films. It received positive reviews but was a box-office flop, becoming the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc20545: A Hologram for the King (film). Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the movie \"a story of confusion, perplexity, frustration and panic,\" praising Tom Hanks's ability to turn it into \"an agreeably uncomfortable comedy,\" meriting a \"Critic's Pick\" designation.[15] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 73% based on 139 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A Hologram for the King amiably ambles through a narrative desert, saved by an oasis of a performance from the ever-dependable Tom Hanks.\"[16] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17]\n\ndoc20546: A Hologram for the King (film). The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office.

On June 12, 2013, Tom Tykwer was reported to be developing an adaptation of 2012 novel A Hologram for the King, written by Dave Eggers. Tykwer wrote and directed the film, which stars Tom Hanks as the lead. The film was made by Playtone, Primeridian Entertainment, and X-Filme Creative Pool.[6] On September 5, 2013, Lotus Entertainment began licensing international rights to the film.[10] On March 6, 2014 it was announced that Sarita Choudhury, Alexander Black, Tracey Fairaway, David Menkin, and Tom Skerritt had joined the cast of the film.[11]\n\ndoc20542: A Hologram for the King (film). The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film). A Hologram for the King is a 2016 comedy-drama film directed, written and co-scored by Tom Tykwer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name written by Dave Eggers,[6][7] and starring Tom Hanks as a washed-up corporate salesman, who goes to Saudi Arabia to propose a business deal.\n\ndoc20541: A Hologram for the King (film). Sidse Babett Knudsen, Tom Skerritt and Sarita Choudhury also star in this international co-production between France, Germany, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, and the United States.[2] The film was released on April 22, 2016, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Saban Films. It received positive reviews but was a box-office flop, becoming the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc20545: A Hologram for the King (film). Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the movie \"a story of confusion, perplexity, frustration and panic,\" praising Tom Hanks's ability to turn it into \"an agreeably uncomfortable comedy,\" meriting a \"Critic's Pick\" designation.[15] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 73% based on 139 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A Hologram for the King amiably ambles through a narrative desert, saved by an oasis of a performance from the ever-dependable Tom Hanks.\"[16] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17]\n\ndoc20546: A Hologram for the King (film). The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office. With a total worldwide gross of $8,244,651 (U.S. domestic gross of $4,212,494), it is the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc1207958: King of Kings (1961 film). The production was photographed in Technirama by Manuel Berenguer, Milton R. Krasner and Franz Planer, and was presented in 70mm Super Technirama at selected first-run engagements.[2] It was the first film of the life of Christ to be presented in 70mm, which was not in use when previous films on the same subject had been made. The previous film version of Christ's life, a church-sponsored film called Day of Triumph, had been filmed in standard \"spherical\" widescreen in 1954 by much the same people who filmed television's The Living Christ Series.[3]\n\ndoc1224661: Holography. When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit parallax, in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\ndoc1224719: Holography.

Aside from establishing shots of iconic landmarks, the scenes in London were largely filmed in Prague, Czech Republic.[2][3]\n\ndoc2020827: The King and Four Queens. At Clark Gable's request, the film was shot on location in southern Utah because he was familiar with the area, having hunted there for years. Footage was shot near St. George, Utah in Snow Canyon State Park and at the Santa Clara River.[4] Additional footage was shot in Calabasas, California.\n\ndoc1311119: Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Filming took place at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The castle scenes were shot on location at Corfe Castle, Dorset, England.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2482107: In the Name of the King. The film was shot near the Municipality of Sooke, the westernmost area of the Greater Victoria, Capital Regional District (CRD), British Columbia. Locals and First Nations people were recruited as extras and for other duties.\n\ndoc2659232: Poovukkul. The first part of the film was shot at Paris, France. Later it was taken to Rome, Italy. Thirdly in New York City, United States. Fourthly in Giza, Egypt, and then Great Wall of China and lastly at Taj Mahal in India.\n\ndoc2016860: 28 Weeks Later. The on-location filming took place in London and 3 Mills Studios, although scenes intended to be shot at Wembley Stadium, then undergoing final stages of a major reconstruction, were filmed instead in Wales, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium used as a replacement.[11]\n\ndoc1004747: Heneral Luna. The film went through a long pre-production phase, which allowed the film's various departments to cope with the challenges of filming a period film in contemporary settings.[23]  With roughly 90% of the film needing to be shot on location, the film required extensive location shoots in the few areas in the Philippines which still matched the architecture and environment of the period.[26]\n\ndoc2457520: The House of the Spirits (film). Principal photography took place in Denmark, but some scenes were filmed in Lisbon and Alentejo, Portugal.\n\ndoc920754: The King's Speech. On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism.[13] Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.[16][17][18]\n\ndoc645291: King Kong (1933 film). In August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Path\u00c3\u00a9 lot in Culver City with the native huts recycled from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Wind's burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\n"

Production was set to begin in first quarter of 2014.[10] Principal photography commenced on March 6, 2014 in Morocco.[12] Filming also took place in Hurghada in Egypt, as well as in Berlin and D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany. Shooting wrapped in June 2014.[13][14]\n\ndoc20543: A Hologram for the King (film). On June 12, 2013, Tom Tykwer was reported to be developing an adaptation of 2012 novel A Hologram for the King, written by Dave Eggers. Tykwer wrote and directed the film, which stars Tom Hanks as the lead. The film was made by Playtone, Primeridian Entertainment, and X-Filme Creative Pool.[6] On September 5, 2013, Lotus Entertainment began licensing international rights to the film.[10] On March 6, 2014 it was announced that Sarita Choudhury, Alexander Black, Tracey Fairaway, David Menkin, and Tom Skerritt had joined the cast of the film.[11]\n\ndoc20542: A Hologram for the King (film). The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film). A Hologram for the King is a 2016 comedy-drama film directed, written and co-scored by Tom Tykwer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name written by Dave Eggers,[6][7] and starring Tom Hanks as a washed-up corporate salesman, who goes to Saudi Arabia to propose a business deal.\n\ndoc20541: A Hologram for the King (film). Sidse Babett Knudsen, Tom Skerritt and Sarita Choudhury also star in this international co-production between France, Germany, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, and the United States.[2] The film was released on April 22, 2016, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Saban Films. It received positive reviews but was a box-office flop, becoming the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc20545: A Hologram for the King (film). Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the movie \"a story of confusion, perplexity, frustration and panic,\" praising Tom Hanks's ability to turn it into \"an agreeably uncomfortable comedy,\" meriting a \"Critic's Pick\" designation.[15] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 73% based on 139 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A Hologram for the King amiably ambles through a narrative desert, saved by an oasis of a performance from the ever-dependable Tom Hanks.\"[16] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17]\n\ndoc20546: A Hologram for the King (film). The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office. With a total worldwide gross of $8,244,651 (U.S. domestic gross of $4,212,494), it is the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc1207958: King of Kings (1961 film). The production was photographed in Technirama by Manuel Berenguer, Milton R. Krasner and Franz Planer, and was presented in 70mm Super Technirama at selected first-run engagements.[2] It was the first film of the life of Christ to be presented in 70mm, which was not in use when previous films on the same subject had been made. The previous film version of Christ's life, a church-sponsored film called Day of Triumph, had been filmed in standard \"spherical\" widescreen in 1954 by much the same people who filmed television's The Living Christ Series.[3]\n\ndoc1224661: Holography. When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit parallax, in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\ndoc1224719: Holography.

Aside from establishing shots of iconic landmarks, the scenes in London were largely filmed in Prague, Czech Republic.[2][3]\n\ndoc2020827: The King and Four Queens. At Clark Gable's request, the film was shot on location in southern Utah because he was familiar with the area, having hunted there for years. Footage was shot near St. George, Utah in Snow Canyon State Park and at the Santa Clara River.[4] Additional footage was shot in Calabasas, California.\n\ndoc1311119: Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Filming took place at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The castle scenes were shot on location at Corfe Castle, Dorset, England.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2482107: In the Name of the King. The film was shot near the Municipality of Sooke, the westernmost area of the Greater Victoria, Capital Regional District (CRD), British Columbia. Locals and First Nations people were recruited as extras and for other duties.\n\ndoc2659232: Poovukkul. The first part of the film was shot at Paris, France. Later it was taken to Rome, Italy. Thirdly in New York City, United States. Fourthly in Giza, Egypt, and then Great Wall of China and lastly at Taj Mahal in India.\n\ndoc2016860: 28 Weeks Later. The on-location filming took place in London and 3 Mills Studios, although scenes intended to be shot at Wembley Stadium, then undergoing final stages of a major reconstruction, were filmed instead in Wales, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium used as a replacement.[11]\n\ndoc1004747: Heneral Luna. The film went through a long pre-production phase, which allowed the film's various departments to cope with the challenges of filming a period film in contemporary settings.[23]  With roughly 90% of the film needing to be shot on location, the film required extensive location shoots in the few areas in the Philippines which still matched the architecture and environment of the period.[26]\n\ndoc2457520: The House of the Spirits (film). Principal photography took place in Denmark, but some scenes were filmed in Lisbon and Alentejo, Portugal.\n\ndoc920754: The King's Speech. On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism.[13] Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.[16][17][18]\n\ndoc645291: King Kong (1933 film). In August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Path\u00c3\u00a9 lot in Culver City with the native huts recycled from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Wind's burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\n"

The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film).

Aside from establishing shots of iconic landmarks, the scenes in London were largely filmed in Prague, Czech Republic.[2][3]\n\ndoc2020827: The King and Four Queens. At Clark Gable's request, the film was shot on location in southern Utah because he was familiar with the area, having hunted there for years. Footage was shot near St. George, Utah in Snow Canyon State Park and at the Santa Clara River.[4] Additional footage was shot in Calabasas, California.\n\ndoc1311119: Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Filming took place at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The castle scenes were shot on location at Corfe Castle, Dorset, England.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2482107: In the Name of the King. The film was shot near the Municipality of Sooke, the westernmost area of the Greater Victoria, Capital Regional District (CRD), British Columbia. Locals and First Nations people were recruited as extras and for other duties.\n\ndoc2659232: Poovukkul. The first part of the film was shot at Paris, France. Later it was taken to Rome, Italy. Thirdly in New York City, United States. Fourthly in Giza, Egypt, and then Great Wall of China and lastly at Taj Mahal in India.\n\ndoc2016860: 28 Weeks Later. The on-location filming took place in London and 3 Mills Studios, although scenes intended to be shot at Wembley Stadium, then undergoing final stages of a major reconstruction, were filmed instead in Wales, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium used as a replacement.[11]\n\ndoc1004747: Heneral Luna. The film went through a long pre-production phase, which allowed the film's various departments to cope with the challenges of filming a period film in contemporary settings.[23]  With roughly 90% of the film needing to be shot on location, the film required extensive location shoots in the few areas in the Philippines which still matched the architecture and environment of the period.[26]\n\ndoc2457520: The House of the Spirits (film). Principal photography took place in Denmark, but some scenes were filmed in Lisbon and Alentejo, Portugal.\n\ndoc920754: The King's Speech. On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism.[13] Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.[16][17][18]\n\ndoc645291: King Kong (1933 film). In August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Path\u00c3\u00a9 lot in Culver City with the native huts recycled from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Wind's burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\n",

Production was set to begin in first quarter of 2014.[10] Principal photography commenced on March 6, 2014 in Morocco.[12] Filming also took place in Hurghada in Egypt, as well as in Berlin and D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany. Shooting wrapped in June 2014.[13][14]\n\ndoc20543: A Hologram for the King (film). On June 12, 2013, Tom Tykwer was reported to be developing an adaptation of 2012 novel A Hologram for the King, written by Dave Eggers. Tykwer wrote and directed the film, which stars Tom Hanks as the lead. The film was made by Playtone, Primeridian Entertainment, and X-Filme Creative Pool.[6] On September 5, 2013, Lotus Entertainment began licensing international rights to the film.[10] On March 6, 2014 it was announced that Sarita Choudhury, Alexander Black, Tracey Fairaway, David Menkin, and Tom Skerritt had joined the cast of the film.[11]\n\ndoc20542: A Hologram for the King (film). The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film). A Hologram for the King is a 2016 comedy-drama film directed, written and co-scored by Tom Tykwer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name written by Dave Eggers,[6][7] and starring Tom Hanks as a washed-up corporate salesman, who goes to Saudi Arabia to propose a business deal.\n\ndoc20541: A Hologram for the King (film). Sidse Babett Knudsen, Tom Skerritt and Sarita Choudhury also star in this international co-production between France, Germany, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, and the United States.[2] The film was released on April 22, 2016, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Saban Films. It received positive reviews but was a box-office flop, becoming the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc20545: A Hologram for the King (film). Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the movie \"a story of confusion, perplexity, frustration and panic,\" praising Tom Hanks's ability to turn it into \"an agreeably uncomfortable comedy,\" meriting a \"Critic's Pick\" designation.[15] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 73% based on 139 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A Hologram for the King amiably ambles through a narrative desert, saved by an oasis of a performance from the ever-dependable Tom Hanks.\"[16] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17]\n\ndoc20546: A Hologram for the King (film). The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office. With a total worldwide gross of $8,244,651 (U.S. domestic gross of $4,212,494), it is the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc1207958: King of Kings (1961 film). The production was photographed in Technirama by Manuel Berenguer, Milton R. Krasner and Franz Planer, and was presented in 70mm Super Technirama at selected first-run engagements.[2] It was the first film of the life of Christ to be presented in 70mm, which was not in use when previous films on the same subject had been made. The previous film version of Christ's life, a church-sponsored film called Day of Triumph, had been filmed in standard \"spherical\" widescreen in 1954 by much the same people who filmed television's The Living Christ Series.[3]\n\ndoc1224661: Holography. When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit parallax, in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\ndoc1224719: Holography.

The castle scenes were shot on location at Corfe Castle, Dorset, England.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2482107: In the Name of the King. The film was shot near the Municipality of Sooke, the westernmost area of the Greater Victoria, Capital Regional District (CRD), British Columbia. Locals and First Nations people were recruited as extras and for other duties.\n\ndoc2659232: Poovukkul. The first part of the film was shot at Paris, France. Later it was taken to Rome, Italy. Thirdly in New York City, United States. Fourthly in Giza, Egypt, and then Great Wall of China and lastly at Taj Mahal in India.\n\ndoc2016860: 28 Weeks Later. The on-location filming took place in London and 3 Mills Studios, although scenes intended to be shot at Wembley Stadium, then undergoing final stages of a major reconstruction, were filmed instead in Wales, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium used as a replacement.[11]\n\ndoc1004747: Heneral Luna. The film went through a long pre-production phase, which allowed the film's various departments to cope with the challenges of filming a period film in contemporary settings.[23]  With roughly 90% of the film needing to be shot on location, the film required extensive location shoots in the few areas in the Philippines which still matched the architecture and environment of the period.[26]\n\ndoc2457520: The House of the Spirits (film). Principal photography took place in Denmark, but some scenes were filmed in Lisbon and Alentejo, Portugal.\n\ndoc920754: The King's Speech. On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism.[13] Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.[16][17][18]\n\ndoc645291: King Kong (1933 film). In August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Path\u00c3\u00a9 lot in Culver City with the native huts recycled from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Wind's burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\n",

Production was set to begin in first quarter of 2014.[10] Principal photography commenced on March 6, 2014 in Morocco.[12] Filming also took place in Hurghada in Egypt, as well as in Berlin and D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany. Shooting wrapped in June 2014.[13][14]\n\ndoc20543: A Hologram for the King (film). On June 12, 2013, Tom Tykwer was reported to be developing an adaptation of 2012 novel A Hologram for the King, written by Dave Eggers. Tykwer wrote and directed the film, which stars Tom Hanks as the lead. The film was made by Playtone, Primeridian Entertainment, and X-Filme Creative Pool.[6] On September 5, 2013, Lotus Entertainment began licensing international rights to the film.[10] On March 6, 2014 it was announced that Sarita Choudhury, Alexander Black, Tracey Fairaway, David Menkin, and Tom Skerritt had joined the cast of the film.[11]\n\ndoc20542: A Hologram for the King (film). The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film). A Hologram for the King is a 2016 comedy-drama film directed, written and co-scored by Tom Tykwer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name written by Dave Eggers,[6][7] and starring Tom Hanks as a washed-up corporate salesman, who goes to Saudi Arabia to propose a business deal.\n\ndoc20541: A Hologram for the King (film). Sidse Babett Knudsen, Tom Skerritt and Sarita Choudhury also star in this international co-production between France, Germany, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, and the United States.[2] The film was released on April 22, 2016, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Saban Films. It received positive reviews but was a box-office flop, becoming the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc20545: A Hologram for the King (film). Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the movie \"a story of confusion, perplexity, frustration and panic,\" praising Tom Hanks's ability to turn it into \"an agreeably uncomfortable comedy,\" meriting a \"Critic's Pick\" designation.[15] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 73% based on 139 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A Hologram for the King amiably ambles through a narrative desert, saved by an oasis of a performance from the ever-dependable Tom Hanks.\"[16] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17]\n\ndoc20546: A Hologram for the King (film). The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office. With a total worldwide gross of $8,244,651 (U.S. domestic gross of $4,212,494), it is the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc1224661: Holography. When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit parallax, in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\ndoc1224719: Holography. Fictional depictions of holograms have, however, inspired technological advances in other fields, such as augmented reality, that promise to fulfill the fictional depictions of holograms by other means.[88]\n\ndoc1207958: King of Kings (1961 film). The production was photographed in Technirama by Manuel Berenguer, Milton R. Krasner and Franz Planer, and was presented in 70mm Super Technirama at selected first-run engagements.[2] It was the first film of the life of Christ to be presented in 70mm, which was not in use when previous films on the same subject had been made. The previous film version of Christ's life, a church-sponsored film called Day of Triumph, had been filmed in standard \"spherical\" widescreen in 1954 by much the same people who filmed television's The Living Christ Series.[3]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhere was the movie \"A Hologram for the King\" filmed, including specific locations and countries?

The film was made by Playtone, Primeridian Entertainment, and X-Filme Creative Pool.[6] On September 5, 2013, Lotus Entertainment began licensing international rights to the film.[10] On March 6, 2014 it was announced that Sarita Choudhury, Alexander Black, Tracey Fairaway, David Menkin, and Tom Skerritt had joined the cast of the film.[11]\n\ndoc20542: A Hologram for the King (film). The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film). A Hologram for the King is a 2016 comedy-drama film directed, written and co-scored by Tom Tykwer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name written by Dave Eggers,[6][7] and starring Tom Hanks as a washed-up corporate salesman, who goes to Saudi Arabia to propose a business deal.\n\ndoc20541: A Hologram for the King (film). Sidse Babett Knudsen, Tom Skerritt and Sarita Choudhury also star in this international co-production between France, Germany, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, and the United States.[2] The film was released on April 22, 2016, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Saban Films. It received positive reviews but was a box-office flop, becoming the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc20545: A Hologram for the King (film). Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the movie \"a story of confusion, perplexity, frustration and panic,\" praising Tom Hanks's ability to turn it into \"an agreeably uncomfortable comedy,\" meriting a \"Critic's Pick\" designation.[15] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 73% based on 139 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A Hologram for the King amiably ambles through a narrative desert, saved by an oasis of a performance from the ever-dependable Tom Hanks.\"[16] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17]\n\ndoc20546: A Hologram for the King (film). The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office. With a total worldwide gross of $8,244,651 (U.S. domestic gross of $4,212,494), it is the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc1224661: Holography. When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit parallax, in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\ndoc1224719: Holography.

Aside from establishing shots of iconic landmarks, the scenes in London were largely filmed in Prague, Czech Republic.[2][3]\n\ndoc2020827: The King and Four Queens. At Clark Gable's request, the film was shot on location in southern Utah because he was familiar with the area, having hunted there for years. Footage was shot near St. George, Utah in Snow Canyon State Park and at the Santa Clara River.[4] Additional footage was shot in Calabasas, California.\n\ndoc1311119: Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Filming took place at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The castle scenes were shot on location at Corfe Castle, Dorset, England.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2482107: In the Name of the King. The film was shot near the Municipality of Sooke, the westernmost area of the Greater Victoria, Capital Regional District (CRD), British Columbia. Locals and First Nations people were recruited as extras and for other duties.\n\ndoc2659232: Poovukkul. The first part of the film was shot at Paris, France. Later it was taken to Rome, Italy.

The on-location filming took place in London and 3 Mills Studios, although scenes intended to be shot at Wembley Stadium, then undergoing final stages of a major reconstruction, were filmed instead in Wales, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium used as a replacement.[11]\n\ndoc1004747: Heneral Luna. The film went through a long pre-production phase, which allowed the film's various departments to cope with the challenges of filming a period film in contemporary settings.[23]  With roughly 90% of the film needing to be shot on location, the film required extensive location shoots in the few areas in the Philippines which still matched the architecture and environment of the period.[26]\n\ndoc2457520: The House of the Spirits (film). Principal photography took place in Denmark, but some scenes were filmed in Lisbon and Alentejo, Portugal.\n\ndoc920754: The King's Speech. On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism.[13] Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.[16][17][18]\n\ndoc645291: King Kong (1933 film). In August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Path\u00c3\u00a9 lot in Culver City with the native huts recycled from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Wind's burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\n",

The series began filming on May 3, 2017 in New York City[16] and it was expected that shooting would take place in a number of locations around the world.[17] Ultimately, the production lasted six months and sprawled across three continents and six countries.[5] Various places stood-in for the locales in which the story actually took place. For instance, scenes set in Yemen were filmed in Morocco, and drone and car travel shots of Pakistani landscapes were used to evoke Afghanistan. Johannesburg, South Africa served as the production base, and was where the bulk of filming took place. The city possessed the \"visual variety\" that the producers were seeking, and doubled for various places including Nairobi, Tanzania, England, Albania, and Las Vegas, Nevada.[9] While there was an initial push to shoot the production all in South Africa, Zisk argued for filming the back half in Morocco. In August 2017, filming took place at the River Caf\u00e9 in Brooklyn.[9]\n\ndoc204308: Lawrence of Arabia (film). The film was made by Horizon Pictures and Columbia Pictures. Principal photography began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 21 September 1962.[41]\n\ndoc2028816: At Play in the Fields of the Lord. The picture was filmed in Bel\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, Brazil. It was released to theaters in the U.S. on December 6, 1991. While the film has been released to VHS and Laserdisc, the film was never released on DVD nor Blu-ray anywhere (except for a 2013 DVD release in Spain). This is due to a rights issue with Universal Pictures (the distributor of the film) and Warner Bros. (current distributors of the Saul Zaentz library).\n\ndoc2192501: Morocco. Cinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of Le chevrier Marocain (\"The Moroccan Goatherd\") by Louis Lumi\u00e8re in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the Ouarzazate area.\n\ndoc2602904: Khuda Kay Liye. Principal photography of the film took place in Lahore, where most of the parts were filmed. Besides, the film was also shot at Chicago, London and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[10]\n\ndoc1920504: Knight and Day. Principal photography began in mid-September 2009 in Boston and Bridgewater, Massachusetts. Airport terminal scenes were filmed at Worcester Regional Airport. Filming also took place in Melrose, Danvers, and New Bedford, Massachusetts.[12] Spanish cities Seville and Cadiz, as well as Austrian city Salzburg, were also chosen as locations.[13]\n\ndoc363162: Harvard University. Harvard's policy since 1970 has been to permit filming on its property only rarely, so most scenes set at Harvard (especially indoor shots, but excepting aerial footage and shots of public areas such as Harvard Square) are in fact shot elsewhere.[144][145]\n\ndoc2486282: Cinema of Iran. Cinema was only five years old when it came to Fati Persia at the beginning of the 20th century. The first Persian filmmaker was Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi, the official photographer of Muzaffar al-Din Shah, the King of Persia from 1896\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1907. After a visit to Paris in July 1900, Akkas Bashi obtained a camera and filmed the Shah's visit to Europe upon the Shah's orders. He is said to have filmed the Shah's private and religious ceremonies, but no copies of such films exist today. A few years after Akkas Bashi started photography, Khan Baba Motazedi, another pioneer in Iranian motion picture photography emerged.[10] He shot a considerable amount of newsreel footage during the reign of Qajar to the Pahlavi dynasty.[11] The first public screening took place in Tehran in 1904, presented by Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahaf Bashi. He arranged the screening in the back of his antique shop. In 1905, Sahaf Bashi opened the first movie theater in Cheragh Gaz Avenue in the national capital. In 1909, with fall of the Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar heir of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and the success of the constitutionalists, Russi Khan lost his support. Consequently, his film theatre and photography studios were destroyed by the public. Soon after, other cinema theatres in Tehran closed down. Movie theatres sprang up again in 1912 with the help of Ardeshir Khan an Armenian -Iranian.[12] In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian decided to establish the first film school in Iran. In 1904, Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi opened the first movie theater in Tehran.[10] The cinematographic camera was introduced to Iran in 1929, as yet another tool of modernization. After Mirza Ebrahim Khan, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.[8] In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian, decided to establish the first film school in Iran. Within five years he managed to run the first session of the school under the name \"Parvareshgahe Artistiye Cinema\".[13]\n\ndoc260317: Culture of Saudi Arabia. During the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the kingdom although they were seen as contrary to tribal norms.[195] All cinemas and theaters were closed in 1980 as a political response to the Islamic revival and the increase in Islamist activism, most particularly the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As of 2014, with the exception of one IMAX theater in Khobar there are no cinemas in Saudi Arabia.[196] Many Saudis watch films via satellite, DVD, or video.\n\ndoc1584336: Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen was shot on location in London, Scotland, and Morocco. Scenes set in Yemen were filmed in Ouarzazate in the Moroccan Atlas Mountains.[14] The restaurant scene in London was filmed at the Oxo Tower. The Sheikh's house in Scotland was filmed at Ardverikie House.[15] Reshooting and water tank work was filmed at Black Hangar Studios in the UK. Principal photography started on 6 August 2010.[3]\n\n"

On June 12, 2013, Tom Tykwer was reported to be developing an adaptation of 2012 novel A Hologram for the King, written by Dave Eggers. Tykwer wrote and directed the film, which stars Tom Hanks as the lead. The film was made by Playtone, Primeridian Entertainment, and X-Filme Creative Pool.[6] On September 5, 2013, Lotus Entertainment began licensing international rights to the film.[10] On March 6, 2014 it was announced that Sarita Choudhury, Alexander Black, Tracey Fairaway, David Menkin, and Tom Skerritt had joined the cast of the film.[11]\n\ndoc20542: A Hologram for the King (film). The film tells the story of a washed-up, desperate American salesman who travels to Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government.[7][9] Set in 2010, before the Arab Spring, American consultant Alan Clay is depressed after losing his house and being divorced by his wife during the Great Recession; he arrives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to make a sale in an upcoming development called the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City).[9]\n\ndoc20540: A Hologram for the King (film). A Hologram for the King is a 2016 comedy-drama film directed, written and co-scored by Tom Tykwer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name written by Dave Eggers,[6][7] and starring Tom Hanks as a washed-up corporate salesman, who goes to Saudi Arabia to propose a business deal.\n\ndoc20541: A Hologram for the King (film). Sidse Babett Knudsen, Tom Skerritt and Sarita Choudhury also star in this international co-production between France, Germany, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, and the United States.[2] The film was released on April 22, 2016, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Saban Films. It received positive reviews but was a box-office flop, becoming the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc20545: A Hologram for the King (film). Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the movie \"a story of confusion, perplexity, frustration and panic,\" praising Tom Hanks's ability to turn it into \"an agreeably uncomfortable comedy,\" meriting a \"Critic's Pick\" designation.[15] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 73% based on 139 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A Hologram for the King amiably ambles through a narrative desert, saved by an oasis of a performance from the ever-dependable Tom Hanks.\"[16] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17]\n\ndoc20546: A Hologram for the King (film). The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office. With a total worldwide gross of $8,244,651 (U.S. domestic gross of $4,212,494), it is the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc1207958: King of Kings (1961 film). The production was photographed in Technirama by Manuel Berenguer, Milton R. Krasner and Franz Planer, and was presented in 70mm Super Technirama at selected first-run engagements.[2] It was the first film of the life of Christ to be presented in 70mm, which was not in use when previous films on the same subject had been made. The previous film version of Christ's life, a church-sponsored film called Day of Triumph, had been filmed in standard \"spherical\" widescreen in 1954 by much the same people who filmed television's The Living Christ Series.[3]\n\ndoc1224661: Holography. When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit parallax, in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\ndoc1224719: Holography.

Writing for the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the movie \"a story of confusion, perplexity, frustration and panic,\" praising Tom Hanks's ability to turn it into \"an agreeably uncomfortable comedy,\" meriting a \"Critic's Pick\" designation.[15] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 73% based on 139 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A Hologram for the King amiably ambles through a narrative desert, saved by an oasis of a performance from the ever-dependable Tom Hanks.\"[16] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17]\n\ndoc20546: A Hologram for the King (film). The film grossed $1.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 11th at the box office. With a total worldwide gross of $8,244,651 (U.S. domestic gross of $4,212,494), it is the lowest-grossing film to feature Tom Hanks in top billing since Every Time We Say Goodbye in 1986.[8]\n\ndoc1224661: Holography. When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit parallax, in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\ndoc1224719: Holography. Fictional depictions of holograms have, however, inspired technological advances in other fields, such as augmented reality, that promise to fulfill the fictional depictions of holograms by other means.[88]\n\ndoc1207958: King of Kings (1961 film). The production was photographed in Technirama by Manuel Berenguer, Milton R. Krasner and Franz Planer, and was presented in 70mm Super Technirama at selected first-run engagements.[2] It was the first film of the life of Christ to be presented in 70mm, which was not in use when previous films on the same subject had been made. The previous film version of Christ's life, a church-sponsored film called Day of Triumph, had been filmed in standard \"spherical\" widescreen in 1954 by much the same people who filmed television's The Living Christ Series.[3]\n\ndoc2004259: Shanghai Knights. Aside from establishing shots of iconic landmarks, the scenes in London were largely filmed in Prague, Czech Republic.[2][3]\n\ndoc2020827: The King and Four Queens. At Clark Gable's request, the film was shot on location in southern Utah because he was familiar with the area, having hunted there for years. Footage was shot near St. George, Utah in Snow Canyon State Park and at the Santa Clara River.[4] Additional footage was shot in Calabasas, California.\n\ndoc1311119: Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Filming took place at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The castle scenes were shot on location at Corfe Castle, Dorset, England.[citation needed]\n\ndoc2482107: In the Name of the King. The film was shot near the Municipality of Sooke, the westernmost area of the Greater Victoria, Capital Regional District (CRD), British Columbia. Locals and First Nations people were recruited as extras and for other duties.\n\ndoc2659232: Poovukkul. The first part of the film was shot at Paris, France. Later it was taken to Rome, Italy. Thirdly in New York City, United States. Fourthly in Giza, Egypt, and then Great Wall of China and lastly at Taj Mahal in India.\n\ndoc2016860: 28 Weeks Later. The on-location filming took place in London and 3 Mills Studios, although scenes intended to be shot at Wembley Stadium, then undergoing final stages of a major reconstruction, were filmed instead in Wales, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium used as a replacement.[11]\n\ndoc1004747: Heneral Luna. The film went through a long pre-production phase, which allowed the film's various departments to cope with the challenges of filming a period film in contemporary settings.[23]  With roughly 90% of the film needing to be shot on location, the film required extensive location shoots in the few areas in the Philippines which still matched the architecture and environment of the period.[26]\n\ndoc2457520: The House of the Spirits (film). Principal photography took place in Denmark, but some scenes were filmed in Lisbon and Alentejo, Portugal.\n\ndoc920754: The King's Speech. On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism.[13] Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.[16][17][18]\n\ndoc645291: King Kong (1933 film). In August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Path\u00c3\u00a9 lot in Culver City with the native huts recycled from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Wind's burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\n",

The series began filming on May 3, 2017 in New York City[16] and it was expected that shooting would take place in a number of locations around the world.[17] Ultimately, the production lasted six months and sprawled across three continents and six countries.[5] Various places stood-in for the locales in which the story actually took place. For instance, scenes set in Yemen were filmed in Morocco, and drone and car travel shots of Pakistani landscapes were used to evoke Afghanistan. Johannesburg, South Africa served as the production base, and was where the bulk of filming took place. The city possessed the \"visual variety\" that the producers were seeking, and doubled for various places including Nairobi, Tanzania, England, Albania, and Las Vegas, Nevada.[9] While there was an initial push to shoot the production all in South Africa, Zisk argued for filming the back half in Morocco. In August 2017, filming took place at the River Caf\u00e9 in Brooklyn.[9]\n\ndoc204308: Lawrence of Arabia (film). The film was made by Horizon Pictures and Columbia Pictures. Principal photography began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 21 September 1962.[41]\n\ndoc2028816: At Play in the Fields of the Lord. The picture was filmed in Bel\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, Brazil. It was released to theaters in the U.S. on December 6, 1991. While the film has been released to VHS and Laserdisc, the film was never released on DVD nor Blu-ray anywhere (except for a 2013 DVD release in Spain). This is due to a rights issue with Universal Pictures (the distributor of the film) and Warner Bros. (current distributors of the Saul Zaentz library).\n\ndoc2192501: Morocco. Cinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of Le chevrier Marocain (\"The Moroccan Goatherd\") by Louis Lumi\u00e8re in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the Ouarzazate area.\n\ndoc2602904: Khuda Kay Liye. Principal photography of the film took place in Lahore, where most of the parts were filmed. Besides, the film was also shot at Chicago, London and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[10]\n\ndoc1920504: Knight and Day. Principal photography began in mid-September 2009 in Boston and Bridgewater, Massachusetts. Airport terminal scenes were filmed at Worcester Regional Airport. Filming also took place in Melrose, Danvers, and New Bedford, Massachusetts.[12] Spanish cities Seville and Cadiz, as well as Austrian city Salzburg, were also chosen as locations.[13]\n\ndoc363162: Harvard University. Harvard's policy since 1970 has been to permit filming on its property only rarely, so most scenes set at Harvard (especially indoor shots, but excepting aerial footage and shots of public areas such as Harvard Square) are in fact shot elsewhere.[144][145]\n\ndoc2486282: Cinema of Iran. Cinema was only five years old when it came to Fati Persia at the beginning of the 20th century. The first Persian filmmaker was Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi, the official photographer of Muzaffar al-Din Shah, the King of Persia from 1896\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1907. After a visit to Paris in July 1900, Akkas Bashi obtained a camera and filmed the Shah's visit to Europe upon the Shah's orders. He is said to have filmed the Shah's private and religious ceremonies, but no copies of such films exist today. A few years after Akkas Bashi started photography, Khan Baba Motazedi, another pioneer in Iranian motion picture photography emerged.[10] He shot a considerable amount of newsreel footage during the reign of Qajar to the Pahlavi dynasty.[11] The first public screening took place in Tehran in 1904, presented by Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahaf Bashi. He arranged the screening in the back of his antique shop. In 1905, Sahaf Bashi opened the first movie theater in Cheragh Gaz Avenue in the national capital. In 1909, with fall of the Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar heir of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and the success of the constitutionalists, Russi Khan lost his support. Consequently, his film theatre and photography studios were destroyed by the public. Soon after, other cinema theatres in Tehran closed down. Movie theatres sprang up again in 1912 with the help of Ardeshir Khan an Armenian -Iranian.[12] In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian decided to establish the first film school in Iran. In 1904, Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi opened the first movie theater in Tehran.[10] The cinematographic camera was introduced to Iran in 1929, as yet another tool of modernization. After Mirza Ebrahim Khan, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.[8] In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian, decided to establish the first film school in Iran. Within five years he managed to run the first session of the school under the name \"Parvareshgahe Artistiye Cinema\".[13]\n\ndoc260317: Culture of Saudi Arabia. During the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the kingdom although they were seen as contrary to tribal norms.[195] All cinemas and theaters were closed in 1980 as a political response to the Islamic revival and the increase in Islamist activism, most particularly the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As of 2014, with the exception of one IMAX theater in Khobar there are no cinemas in Saudi Arabia.[196] Many Saudis watch films via satellite, DVD, or video.\n\ndoc1584336: Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen was shot on location in London, Scotland, and Morocco. Scenes set in Yemen were filmed in Ouarzazate in the Moroccan Atlas Mountains.[14] The restaurant scene in London was filmed at the Oxo Tower. The Sheikh's house in Scotland was filmed at Ardverikie House.[15] Reshooting and water tank work was filmed at Black Hangar Studios in the UK. Principal photography started on 6 August 2010.[3]\n\n"
