The Committee's influence diminished,[1] and it was disestablished in 1795.\n\ndoc515884: Caesarean section. European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc2443122: Obstetrics. As midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.[12][13]\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc786997: Multiple birth. A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation, planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.[39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008.[40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.[41]\n\ndoc293884: Childbirth. In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through induction of labour or caesarean section. Caesarean section is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth.[69] Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006.  In 2011, 32.8% of births in the U.S. were delivered by cesarean section.[69] Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother. Therefore, many guidelines recommend against non-medically required induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks.[70]  The 2012 rate of labour induction in the United States was 23.3%, and has more than doubled from 1990 to 2010.[71][72] Pitocin is commonly used to induce uterine contractions.  A large review of methods of induction was published in 2011.[73]\n\n",

The Roman Lex Regia (royal law), later the Lex Caesarea (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715\u00e2\u20ac\u201c673 BC),[106] required the child of a mother dead in childbirth to be cut from her womb.[107] There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant,[108] that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.[109] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false.[110] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.[107][111] As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.[112] The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere, \"to cut\", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones.

Spinal anaesthesia is the technique of choice for Caesarean section as it avoids a general anaesthetic and the risk of failed intubation (which is probably a lot lower than the widely-quoted 1 in 250 in pregnant women[3]). It also means the mother is conscious and the partner is able to be present at the birth of the child. The post operative analgesia from intrathecal opioids in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also good.\n\ndoc515820: Caesarean section. In Canada the difference in serious morbidity or mortality for the mother (e.g. cardiac arrest, wound hematoma, or hysterectomy) was 1.8 additional cases per 100 or three times the risk.[19]\n\ndoc515821: Caesarean section. A caesarean section is associated with risks of postoperative adhesions, incisional hernias (which may require surgical correction) and wound infections.[20] If a caesarean is performed in an emergency, the risk of the surgery may be increased due to a number of factors. The patient's stomach may not be empty, increasing the risk of anaesthesia.[21] Other risks include severe blood loss (which may require a blood transfusion) and postdural-puncture spinal headaches.[20]\n\ndoc515853: Caesarean section. The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of Misgav Ladach, a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al in 1994[52] and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. However, there is an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.[53][54]\n\ndoc515814: Caesarean section. Complications of labour and factors increasing the risk associated with vaginal delivery, such as:\n\ndoc293890: Childbirth. In 2013 a review of the effectiveness of active management for reducing caesarean section  rates in low-risk women was carried out.\nActive management of labour consists of a number of care principles, including \"strict diagnosis of labour\", routine artificial rupture of membranes, oxytocin for slow progress, and one-to-one support.  The review reported that when compared to routine care there were no differences in the use of medications for pain, maternal or neonatal complications, or rates of assisted vaginal deliveries.  There was a slight reduction in the caesarean section  rate, however active management was seen as \"highly prescriptive and interventional.\"[82]\n\ndoc515836: Caesarean section. Other risks include:\n\ndoc2443125: Obstetrics. Gynaecology and Obstetrics gained attention in the American medical field at the end of the nineteenth century through the development of such procedures as the ovariotomy. These procedures then were shared with European surgeons who replicated the surgeries. This was a period when antiseptic, aseptic or anaesthetic measures were just being introduced to surgical and observational procedures and without these procedures surgeries were dangerous and often fatal. Following are two surgeons noted for their contributions to these fields include Ephraim McDowell and James Marion Sims.\n\ndoc515828: Caesarean section. There are number of steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of adhesions. Such techniques and principles may include:\n\ndoc515858: Caesarean section. Regional anaesthesia is used in 95% of deliveries, with spinal and combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia being the most commonly used regional techniques in scheduled Caesarean section.[62] Regional anaesthesia during Caesarean section is different from the analgesia (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense nerve block.\n\n"

The Roman Lex Regia (royal law), later the Lex Caesarea (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715\u00e2\u20ac\u201c673 BC),[106] required the child of a mother dead in childbirth to be cut from her womb.[107] There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant,[108] that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.[109] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false.[110] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.[107][111] As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.[112] The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere, \"to cut\", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones. Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, \"cut from the womb\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \"Caesar\" which was then carried by his descendants.[107] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as \"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\".[113] Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar\"[114]\n\ndoc725526: Timeline of the French Revolution.

The first successful Caesarean section to be performed in America took place in Mason County, Virginia (now Mason County, West Virginia), in 1794. The procedure was performed by Dr. Jesse Bennett on his wife Elizabeth.[103]\n\ndoc1427: Jesse Bennett. Because Dr. Bennett didn't report the operation during his life, it was long believed the first successful American Caesarian section had been performed in 1827 by Dr. John Lambert in Ohio. Dr. Lambert lived only ten miles from Dr. Bennett's practice.[3]\n\ndoc515888: Caesarean section. The Roman Lex Regia (royal law), later the Lex Caesarea (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715\u00e2\u20ac\u201c673 BC),[106] required the child of a mother dead in childbirth to be cut from her womb.[107] There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant,[108] that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.[109] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false.[110] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.[107][111] As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.[112] The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere, \"to cut\", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones. Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, \"cut from the womb\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \"Caesar\" which was then carried by his descendants.[107] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as \"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\".[113] Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar\"[114]\n\ndoc662326: Timeline of labor issues and events. 1794 (United States)\n\ndoc740113: Committee of Public Safety.

The execution of Robespierre in July 1794 represented a reactionary period against the Committee of Public Safety. This is known as the Thermidorian Reaction, as Robespierre's fall from power occurred during the Revolutionary month of Thermidor. The Committee's influence diminished,[1] and it was disestablished in 1795.\n\ndoc515884: Caesarean section. European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc2443122: Obstetrics. As midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.[12][13]\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc786997: Multiple birth. A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation, planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.[39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008.[40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.[41]\n\ndoc293884: Childbirth. In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through induction of labour or caesarean section. Caesarean section is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth.[69] Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006.  In 2011, 32.8% of births in the U.S. were delivered by cesarean section.[69] Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother. Therefore, many guidelines recommend against non-medically required induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks.[70]  The 2012 rate of labour induction in the United States was 23.3%, and has more than doubled from 1990 to 2010.[71][72] Pitocin is commonly used to induce uterine contractions.  A large review of methods of induction was published in 2011.[73]\n\n"

Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.[109] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false.[110] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.[107][111] As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.[112] The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere, \"to cut\", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones. Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, \"cut from the womb\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \"Caesar\" which was then carried by his descendants.[107] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as \"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\".[113] Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar\"[114]\n\ndoc662326: Timeline of labor issues and events. 1794 (United States)\n\ndoc740113: Committee of Public Safety.

The execution of Robespierre in July 1794 represented a reactionary period against the Committee of Public Safety. This is known as the Thermidorian Reaction, as Robespierre's fall from power occurred during the Revolutionary month of Thermidor. The Committee's influence diminished,[1] and it was disestablished in 1795.\n\ndoc515884: Caesarean section. European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc2443122: Obstetrics. As midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.[12][13]\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc786997: Multiple birth. A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation, planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.[39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008.[40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.[41]\n\ndoc293884: Childbirth. In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through induction of labour or caesarean section. Caesarean section is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth.[69] Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006.  In 2011, 32.8% of births in the U.S. were delivered by cesarean section.[69] Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother. Therefore, many guidelines recommend against non-medically required induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks.[70]  The 2012 rate of labour induction in the United States was 23.3%, and has more than doubled from 1990 to 2010.[71][72] Pitocin is commonly used to induce uterine contractions.  A large review of methods of induction was published in 2011.[73]\n\n"

Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, \"cut from the womb\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \"Caesar\" which was then carried by his descendants.[107] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as \"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\".[113] Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar\"[114]\n\ndoc662326: Timeline of labor issues and events. 1794 (United States)\n\ndoc740113: Committee of Public Safety.

The execution of Robespierre in July 1794 represented a reactionary period against the Committee of Public Safety. This is known as the Thermidorian Reaction, as Robespierre's fall from power occurred during the Revolutionary month of Thermidor. The Committee's influence diminished,[1] and it was disestablished in 1795.\n\ndoc515884: Caesarean section. European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc2443122: Obstetrics. As midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.[12][13]\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc786997: Multiple birth. A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation, planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.[39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008.[40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.[41]\n\ndoc293884: Childbirth. In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through induction of labour or caesarean section. Caesarean section is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth.[69] Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006.  In 2011, 32.8% of births in the U.S. were delivered by cesarean section.[69] Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother. Therefore, many guidelines recommend against non-medically required induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks.[70]  The 2012 rate of labour induction in the United States was 23.3%, and has more than doubled from 1990 to 2010.[71][72] Pitocin is commonly used to induce uterine contractions.  A large review of methods of induction was published in 2011.[73]\n\n",

Dr. Jesse Bennett (July 10, 1769 \u00e2\u20ac\u201dJuly 13, 1842) was the first American physician to perform a successful Caesarean section, which he performed on his own wife at the birth of their only child on January 14, 1794.[1][2]\n\ndoc515885: Caesarean section.

Because Dr. Bennett didn't report the operation during his life, it was long believed the first successful American Caesarian section had been performed in 1827 by Dr. John Lambert in Ohio.

European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc2443122: Obstetrics. As midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.[12][13]\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc786997: Multiple birth. A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation, planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.[39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008.[40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.[41]\n\ndoc293884: Childbirth. In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through induction of labour or caesarean section. Caesarean section is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth.[69] Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006.  In 2011, 32.8% of births in the U.S. were delivered by cesarean section.[69] Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother. Therefore, many guidelines recommend against non-medically required induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks.[70]  The 2012 rate of labour induction in the United States was 23.3%, and has more than doubled from 1990 to 2010.[71][72] Pitocin is commonly used to induce uterine contractions.  A large review of methods of induction was published in 2011.[73]\n\n",

Finally, what were the broader societal and cultural attitudes towards Cesarean sections in 1794 America, and how did these views influence the decision to perform the surgery?\n"

European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc2443122: Obstetrics. As midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.[12][13]\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc786997: Multiple birth. A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation, planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.[39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008.[40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.[41]\n\ndoc293884: Childbirth. In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through induction of labour or caesarean section. Caesarean section is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth.[69] Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006.  In 2011, 32.8% of births in the U.S. were delivered by cesarean section.[69] Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother. Therefore, many guidelines recommend against non-medically required induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks.[70]  The 2012 rate of labour induction in the United States was 23.3%, and has more than doubled from 1990 to 2010.[71][72] Pitocin is commonly used to induce uterine contractions.  A large review of methods of induction was published in 2011.[73]\n\n",

The Roman Lex Regia (royal law), later the Lex Caesarea (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715\u00e2\u20ac\u201c673 BC),[106] required the child of a mother dead in childbirth to be cut from her womb.[107] There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant,[108] that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.[109] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false.[110] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.[107][111] As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.[112] The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere, \"to cut\", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones. Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, \"cut from the womb\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \"Caesar\" which was then carried by his descendants.[107] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as \"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\".[113] Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar\"[114]\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate.

The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc1844318: Spinal anaesthesia. Spinal anaesthesia is the technique of choice for Caesarean section as it avoids a general anaesthetic and the risk of failed intubation (which is probably a lot lower than the widely-quoted 1 in 250 in pregnant women[3]). It also means the mother is conscious and the partner is able to be present at the birth of the child. The post operative analgesia from intrathecal opioids in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also good.\n\ndoc515820: Caesarean section. In Canada the difference in serious morbidity or mortality for the mother (e.g. cardiac arrest, wound hematoma, or hysterectomy) was 1.8 additional cases per 100 or three times the risk.[19]\n\ndoc515821: Caesarean section. A caesarean section is associated with risks of postoperative adhesions, incisional hernias (which may require surgical correction) and wound infections.[20] If a caesarean is performed in an emergency, the risk of the surgery may be increased due to a number of factors. The patient's stomach may not be empty, increasing the risk of anaesthesia.[21] Other risks include severe blood loss (which may require a blood transfusion) and postdural-puncture spinal headaches.[20]\n\ndoc515853: Caesarean section. The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of Misgav Ladach, a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al in 1994[52] and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. However, there is an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.[53][54]\n\ndoc515814: Caesarean section. Complications of labour and factors increasing the risk associated with vaginal delivery, such as:\n\ndoc293890: Childbirth. In 2013 a review of the effectiveness of active management for reducing caesarean section  rates in low-risk women was carried out.\nActive management of labour consists of a number of care principles, including \"strict diagnosis of labour\", routine artificial rupture of membranes, oxytocin for slow progress, and one-to-one support.  The review reported that when compared to routine care there were no differences in the use of medications for pain, maternal or neonatal complications, or rates of assisted vaginal deliveries.  There was a slight reduction in the caesarean section  rate, however active management was seen as \"highly prescriptive and interventional.\"[82]\n\ndoc515836: Caesarean section. Other risks include:\n\ndoc2443125: Obstetrics. Gynaecology and Obstetrics gained attention in the American medical field at the end of the nineteenth century through the development of such procedures as the ovariotomy. These procedures then were shared with European surgeons who replicated the surgeries. This was a period when antiseptic, aseptic or anaesthetic measures were just being introduced to surgical and observational procedures and without these procedures surgeries were dangerous and often fatal. Following are two surgeons noted for their contributions to these fields include Ephraim McDowell and James Marion Sims.\n\ndoc515828: Caesarean section. There are number of steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of adhesions. Such techniques and principles may include:\n\ndoc515858: Caesarean section. Regional anaesthesia is used in 95% of deliveries, with spinal and combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia being the most commonly used regional techniques in scheduled Caesarean section.[62] Regional anaesthesia during Caesarean section is different from the analgesia (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense nerve block.\n\n"

European travelers in the Great Lakes region of Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.[101] The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.[101] James Barry carried out the first successful Caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.[102]\n\ndoc515812: Caesarean section. In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally.[8] The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections.[4] Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.[8] More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5% while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%.[8] There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section.[8] In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section.[2][3] The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother with the occasional baby surviving.[9] Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to the 1500s.[9] With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s survival of both the mother and baby became common.[9]\n\ndoc515883: Caesarean section. Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother. In an account from the 1580s, in Siegershausen, Switzerland, Jakob Nufer a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.[99] However, there is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.[100] For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515809: Caesarean section. Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies.[2] A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.[2] This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.[2][3] A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.[2][3] A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.[2] The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.[3][4] However, some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.[2]\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc2443122: Obstetrics. As midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.[12][13]\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc515839: Caesarean section. It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.[44]\n\ndoc786997: Multiple birth. A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation, planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.[39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008.[40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.[41]\n\ndoc293884: Childbirth. In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through induction of labour or caesarean section. Caesarean section is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth.[69] Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006.  In 2011, 32.8% of births in the U.S. were delivered by cesarean section.[69] Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother. Therefore, many guidelines recommend against non-medically required induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks.[70]  The 2012 rate of labour induction in the United States was 23.3%, and has more than doubled from 1990 to 2010.[71][72] Pitocin is commonly used to induce uterine contractions.  A large review of methods of induction was published in 2011.[73]\n\n",

However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:\n\ndoc515879: Caesarean section. The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed yotzei dofen. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother. [93]\n\ndoc2443122: Obstetrics. As midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.[12][13]\n\ndoc515892: Caesarean section. The term caesarean is spelled in various accepted ways, as discussed at Wiktionary. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses cesarean section,[118], while some other American medical works, e.g. Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, use caesarean,[119] as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published Merriam-Webster Dictionary[120] and American Heritage Dictionary[119] list cesarean first and other spellings as \"variants\", an etymologically anhistorical position.\n\ndoc1844318: Spinal anaesthesia. Spinal anaesthesia is the technique of choice for Caesarean section as it avoids a general anaesthetic and the risk of failed intubation (which is probably a lot lower than the widely-quoted 1 in 250 in pregnant women[3]). It also means the mother is conscious and the partner is able to be present at the birth of the child. The post operative analgesia from intrathecal opioids in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also good.\n\ndoc515820: Caesarean section. In Canada the difference in serious morbidity or mortality for the mother (e.g. cardiac arrest, wound hematoma, or hysterectomy) was 1.8 additional cases per 100 or three times the risk.[19]\n\ndoc515821: Caesarean section. A caesarean section is associated with risks of postoperative adhesions, incisional hernias (which may require surgical correction) and wound infections.[20] If a caesarean is performed in an emergency, the risk of the surgery may be increased due to a number of factors. The patient's stomach may not be empty, increasing the risk of anaesthesia.[21] Other risks include severe blood loss (which may require a blood transfusion) and postdural-puncture spinal headaches.[20]\n\ndoc515853: Caesarean section. The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of Misgav Ladach, a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al in 1994[52] and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. However, there is an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.[53][54]\n\ndoc515814: Caesarean section. Complications of labour and factors increasing the risk associated with vaginal delivery, such as:\n\ndoc293890: Childbirth. In 2013 a review of the effectiveness of active management for reducing caesarean section  rates in low-risk women was carried out.\nActive management of labour consists of a number of care principles, including \"strict diagnosis of labour\", routine artificial rupture of membranes, oxytocin for slow progress, and one-to-one support.  The review reported that when compared to routine care there were no differences in the use of medications for pain, maternal or neonatal complications, or rates of assisted vaginal deliveries.  There was a slight reduction in the caesarean section  rate, however active management was seen as \"highly prescriptive and interventional.\"[82]\n\ndoc515836: Caesarean section. Other risks include:\n\ndoc2443125: Obstetrics. Gynaecology and Obstetrics gained attention in the American medical field at the end of the nineteenth century through the development of such procedures as the ovariotomy. These procedures then were shared with European surgeons who replicated the surgeries. This was a period when antiseptic, aseptic or anaesthetic measures were just being introduced to surgical and observational procedures and without these procedures surgeries were dangerous and often fatal. Following are two surgeons noted for their contributions to these fields include Ephraim McDowell and James Marion Sims.\n\ndoc515828: Caesarean section. There are number of steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of adhesions. Such techniques and principles may include:\n\ndoc515858: Caesarean section. Regional anaesthesia is used in 95% of deliveries, with spinal and combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia being the most commonly used regional techniques in scheduled Caesarean section.[62] Regional anaesthesia during Caesarean section is different from the analgesia (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense nerve block.\n\n"
