The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a hotshot crew in 2008.[5] The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment, including two 10-person crew carriers, was housed.[6] The 2017 film Only the Brave was based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Fire.\n\ndoc1957917: Yarnell Hill Fire. The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough.[19] He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC Captain.[15] Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew entrapment.[5][20] After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew.[5]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery. The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite.

Limestone is a key ingredient in concrete and Pico Blanco contains a particularly high grade deposit, reportedly the largest in California,[161] and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains.[162] In 1980 Granite Rock applied for a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to begin excavating a 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary.[97]\n\ndoc2438387: Hot 'n Now.

The minimum annual-training requirement to maintain firefighting and medical skills is 240 hours per year. Special teams and company-level drills add significantly to that number of hours.[52]\n\ndoc65790: Firefighting. Firefighters typically undergo a high degree of technical training.[1][2] This involves both general firefighting techniques and developing specialist expertise in particular fire operations, such as aircraft firefighting and wildland firefighting In the U.S. the national level of certifications are called Firefighter I/II.\n\ndoc331980: Firefighter. The skills required for safe operations are regularly practiced during training evaluations throughout a firefighter's career. Initial firefighting skills are normally taught through local, regional or state-approved fire academies or training courses.[1] Depending on the requirements of a department, additional skills and certifications such as technical rescue and pre-hospital medicine may also be acquired at this time.\n\ndoc332039: Firefighter. Master of Engineering and two years of departmental training.\n\ndoc2516685: High reliability organization. Although the original research and early application of HRO theory into practice occurred in high risk industries, research today covers a wide variety of applications and settings. Health care has been the largest practitioner area for the past several years.[4] The applications of Crew Resource Management  is another area of focus for leaders in HROs requiring competent behavior systems measurement and intervention.[18]   Wildfires create complex and very dynamic mega-crisis situations across the globe every year. U.S. wildland firefighters, often organized using the Incident Command System into flexible inter-agency incident management teams, are not only called upon to \"bring order to chaos\" in today's huge mega-fires, they also are requested on \"all-hazard events\" like hurricanes, floods and earthquakes.  The U.S. Wildland Fire Lessons Learned Center has been providing education and training to the wildland fire community on high reliability since 2002. HRO behaviors can be recognized and further developed into high-functioning skills of anticipation and resilience. Learning organizations that strive for high performance in things they can plan for, can become HROs that are able to better manage unexpected events that by definition cannot be planned for.\n\ndoc2380437: Bureau of Fire Protection. Non Commissioned Officer Rank\n-\n\ndoc1828094: New York City Fire Department. Located centrally at the Training Academy on Randall's Island, the Bureau of Training is responsible for all training needs for the Fire Department of New York.[41] Initial training of all firefighter candidates undergo an 18-week academy that consists of classroom education and physical fitness performance.[42]\n\ndoc2001188: Waldo Canyon Fire. The Pikes Peak Community Foundation created The Waldo Canyon Fire Fighter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fund on June 28 to support the efforts of public and volunteer fire departments in El Paso and Teller Counties. This fund provided financial resources for the fire departments for food, cots, firefighting equipment, or future wildfire mitigation efforts in the Pikes Peak region.[30]\n\ndoc2225843: Firefighting in the United States. Firefighting in the United States is becoming more of a profession than it once was. Historically, especially in smaller departments, little formal training of firefighters was required. Now, most states require both career and volunteer firefighters to complete a certificate program at a fire academy. Associate's, bachelor's and master's degree programs in firefighting disciplines are available at colleges and universities. Such advanced training is becoming a de facto prerequisite for command in larger departments. The U.S. Fire Administration operates the National Fire Academy, which also provides specialized firefighter training.\n\ndoc331993: Firefighter. Firefighters in the United States are frequently the first responders to hazardous material fire situations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard 1910.120[4] defines four standards of training first responder awareness level, first responder operations level, hazardous materials technician, and Hazardous materials specialist. EMS-based paramedics are typically trained to the awareness level, whereas career and volunteer firefighters are often trained to the operations level or better. Other nations have trained only elite firefighters and rescuers to do hazmat so that funding and equipment could go to fewer stations. This gives departments elite hazmat personnel and high-grade equipment for an incident. Departments place these companies in stations where they can be very mobile.\n\n"

The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite. A-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic \"hot spot\" activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry. These granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.[10][11]\n\ndoc102124: Hot Coffee mod. On June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled.

By this time Granite Rock's permit had expired. In 2010, the company's president stated that he believed that at some point the company would be allowed to extract the limestone in a way that doesn't harm the environment.[163][164] As of 2017[update], they still own the land, which is zoned WSC/40-D(CZ) for Watershed and Scenic Conservation.[97]\n\ndoc102119: Hot Coffee mod. On August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory recall for all games still owned by the general public.[citation needed] Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the \"uncensored\" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily. However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have grandfathered these copies of the game to their collection.[citation needed]\n\ndoc3412: Big Sur. Mount Pico Blanco is topped by a distinctive white limestone cap, visible from California's Highway One.[160] The Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California has since 1963 owned the mineral rights to 2,800 acres (1,100\u00a0ha), or all of section 36, which sits astride and surrounds the summit of Pico Blanco Mountain.

The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a hotshot crew in 2008.[5] The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment, including two 10-person crew carriers, was housed.[6] The 2017 film Only the Brave was based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Fire.\n\ndoc1957917: Yarnell Hill Fire. The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough.[19] He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC Captain.[15] Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew entrapment.[5][20] After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew.[5]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery. The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite. A-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic \"hot spot\" activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry. These granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.[10][11]\n\ndoc102124: Hot Coffee mod. On June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled. They are required to \"clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority.\" Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in civil penalties.[22]\n\ndoc3414: Big Sur. By this time Granite Rock's permit had expired. In 2010, the company's president stated that he believed that at some point the company would be allowed to extract the limestone in a way that doesn't harm the environment.[163][164] As of 2017[update], they still own the land, which is zoned WSC/40-D(CZ) for Watershed and Scenic Conservation.[97]\n\ndoc102119: Hot Coffee mod. On August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory recall for all games still owned by the general public.[citation needed] Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the \"uncensored\" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily. However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have grandfathered these copies of the game to their collection.[citation needed]\n\ndoc3412: Big Sur. Mount Pico Blanco is topped by a distinctive white limestone cap, visible from California's Highway One.[160] The Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California has since 1963 owned the mineral rights to 2,800 acres (1,100\u00a0ha), or all of section 36, which sits astride and surrounds the summit of Pico Blanco Mountain. Limestone is a key ingredient in concrete and Pico Blanco contains a particularly high grade deposit, reportedly the largest in California,[161] and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains.[162] In 1980 Granite Rock applied for a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to begin excavating a 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary.[97]\n\ndoc2438387: Hot 'n Now.

The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a hotshot crew in 2008.[5] The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment, including two 10-person crew carriers, was housed.[6] The 2017 film Only the Brave was based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Fire.\n\ndoc1957917: Yarnell Hill Fire. The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough.[19] He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC Captain.[15] Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew entrapment.[5][20] After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew.[5]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery. The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite. A-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic \"hot spot\" activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry. These granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.[10][11]\n\ndoc102124: Hot Coffee mod. On June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled. They are required to \"clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority.\" Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in civil penalties.[22]\n\ndoc3414: Big Sur. By this time Granite Rock's permit had expired. In 2010, the company's president stated that he believed that at some point the company would be allowed to extract the limestone in a way that doesn't harm the environment.[163][164] As of 2017[update], they still own the land, which is zoned WSC/40-D(CZ) for Watershed and Scenic Conservation.[97]\n\ndoc102119: Hot Coffee mod. On August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory recall for all games still owned by the general public.[citation needed] Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the \"uncensored\" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily. However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have grandfathered these copies of the game to their collection.[citation needed]\n\ndoc3412: Big Sur. Mount Pico Blanco is topped by a distinctive white limestone cap, visible from California's Highway One.[160] The Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California has since 1963 owned the mineral rights to 2,800 acres (1,100\u00a0ha), or all of section 36, which sits astride and surrounds the summit of Pico Blanco Mountain. Limestone is a key ingredient in concrete and Pico Blanco contains a particularly high grade deposit, reportedly the largest in California,[161] and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains.[162] In 1980 Granite Rock applied for a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to begin excavating a 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary.[97]\n\ndoc2438387: Hot 'n Now. In October 2003, Proquest Capital Corporation acquired Hot 'n Now assets and some liabilities from Hot 'n Now, LLC. Proquest was soon renamed to Hot Brands, Inc.

The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough.[19] He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position.

In order to enter these elite military schools, the individual must meet the following standards:\n\ndoc2527439: Civil Air Patrol. Senior members are provided with an optional Senior Member Professional Development program and are encouraged to progress within it. The professional development program consists of five levels, corresponding with grades from second lieutenant to lieutenant colonel. Each level of development has components of leadership training, corporate familiarization and aerospace education, as well as professional development within chosen \"Specialty Tracks\". There are many Specialty Tracks and they are designed both to support the organization and to provide opportunities for senior members to take advantage of skills they have from their private lives. Available Specialty Tracks include Logistics, Communications, Cadet Programs, Public Affairs, Legal, Administration, Emergency Services, Finance, and many more.[34] Additionally senior members with specific civilian professional qualifications may be awarded grade on the basis of their professional qualifications. Examples include FAA Certified Flight Instructors, Certified Ground Instructors, attorneys, medical professionals, Certified Public Accountants, clergy, and licensed educators or administrators who are often promoted directly to first lieutenant or captain.[35]\n\ndoc544885: Awards and decorations of the United States Armed Forces.

The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires.

The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough.[19] He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC Captain.[15] Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew entrapment.[5][20] After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew.[5]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery. The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite. A-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic \"hot spot\" activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry.

Limestone is a key ingredient in concrete and Pico Blanco contains a particularly high grade deposit, reportedly the largest in California,[161] and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains.[162] In 1980 Granite Rock applied for a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to begin excavating a 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary.[97]\n\ndoc2438387: Hot 'n Now.

In 2010, the company's president stated that he believed that at some point the company would be allowed to extract the limestone in a way that doesn't harm the environment.[163][164] As of 2017[update], they still own the land, which is zoned WSC/40-D(CZ) for Watershed and Scenic Conservation.[97]\n\ndoc3412: Big Sur. Mount Pico Blanco is topped by a distinctive white limestone cap, visible from California's Highway One.[160] The Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California has since 1963 owned the mineral rights to 2,800 acres (1,100\u00a0ha), or all of section 36, which sits astride and surrounds the summit of Pico Blanco Mountain. Limestone is a key ingredient in concrete and Pico Blanco contains a particularly high grade deposit, reportedly the largest in California,[161] and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains.[162] In 1980 Granite Rock applied for a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to begin excavating a 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary.[97]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite. A-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic \"hot spot\" activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry. These granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.[10][11]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc102124: Hot Coffee mod. On June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled. They are required to \"clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority.\" Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in civil penalties.[22]\n\ndoc102119: Hot Coffee mod. On August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory recall for all games still owned by the general public.[citation needed] Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the \"uncensored\" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily. However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have grandfathered these copies of the game to their collection.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery. The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc2438387: Hot 'n Now. In October 2003, Proquest Capital Corporation acquired Hot 'n Now assets and some liabilities from Hot 'n Now, LLC. Proquest was soon renamed to Hot Brands, Inc. At the time of acquisition, the chain had 44 locations, 23 corporate and 21 franchisee owned, in three states: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana.[10]\n\ndoc2205301: History of Arizona.

The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a hotshot crew in 2008.[5] The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment, including two 10-person crew carriers, was housed.[6] The 2017 film Only the Brave was based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Fire.\n\ndoc2205301: History of Arizona.

Although the original research and early application of HRO theory into practice occurred in high risk industries, research today covers a wide variety of applications and settings. Health care has been the largest practitioner area for the past several years.[4] The applications of Crew Resource Management  is another area of focus for leaders in HROs requiring competent behavior systems measurement and intervention.[18]   Wildfires create complex and very dynamic mega-crisis situations across the globe every year. U.S. wildland firefighters, often organized using the Incident Command System into flexible inter-agency incident management teams, are not only called upon to \"bring order to chaos\" in today's huge mega-fires, they also are requested on \"all-hazard events\" like hurricanes, floods and earthquakes.  The U.S. Wildland Fire Lessons Learned Center has been providing education and training to the wildland fire community on high reliability since 2002. HRO behaviors can be recognized and further developed into high-functioning skills of anticipation and resilience. Learning organizations that strive for high performance in things they can plan for, can become HROs that are able to better manage unexpected events that by definition cannot be planned for.\n\ndoc2380437: Bureau of Fire Protection. Non Commissioned Officer Rank\n-\n\ndoc1828094: New York City Fire Department. Located centrally at the Training Academy on Randall's Island, the Bureau of Training is responsible for all training needs for the Fire Department of New York.[41] Initial training of all firefighter candidates undergo an 18-week academy that consists of classroom education and physical fitness performance.[42]\n\ndoc2001188: Waldo Canyon Fire. The Pikes Peak Community Foundation created The Waldo Canyon Fire Fighter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fund on June 28 to support the efforts of public and volunteer fire departments in El Paso and Teller Counties. This fund provided financial resources for the fire departments for food, cots, firefighting equipment, or future wildfire mitigation efforts in the Pikes Peak region.[30]\n\ndoc2225843: Firefighting in the United States. Firefighting in the United States is becoming more of a profession than it once was. Historically, especially in smaller departments, little formal training of firefighters was required. Now, most states require both career and volunteer firefighters to complete a certificate program at a fire academy. Associate's, bachelor's and master's degree programs in firefighting disciplines are available at colleges and universities. Such advanced training is becoming a de facto prerequisite for command in larger departments. The U.S. Fire Administration operates the National Fire Academy, which also provides specialized firefighter training.\n\ndoc331993: Firefighter. Firefighters in the United States are frequently the first responders to hazardous material fire situations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard 1910.120[4] defines four standards of training first responder awareness level, first responder operations level, hazardous materials technician, and Hazardous materials specialist. EMS-based paramedics are typically trained to the awareness level, whereas career and volunteer firefighters are often trained to the operations level or better. Other nations have trained only elite firefighters and rescuers to do hazmat so that funding and equipment could go to fewer stations. This gives departments elite hazmat personnel and high-grade equipment for an incident. Departments place these companies in stations where they can be very mobile.\n\n"

The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires.

The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough.[19] He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC Captain.[15] Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew entrapment.[5][20] After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew.[5]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery.

McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC Captain.[15] Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew entrapment.[5][20] After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew.[5]\n\ndoc3414: Big Sur. By this time Granite Rock's permit had expired. In 2010, the company's president stated that he believed that at some point the company would be allowed to extract the limestone in a way that doesn't harm the environment.[163][164] As of 2017[update], they still own the land, which is zoned WSC/40-D(CZ) for Watershed and Scenic Conservation.[97]\n\ndoc3412: Big Sur. Mount Pico Blanco is topped by a distinctive white limestone cap, visible from California's Highway One.[160] The Granite Rock Company of Watsonville, California has since 1963 owned the mineral rights to 2,800 acres (1,100\u00a0ha), or all of section 36, which sits astride and surrounds the summit of Pico Blanco Mountain. Limestone is a key ingredient in concrete and Pico Blanco contains a particularly high grade deposit, reportedly the largest in California,[161] and the largest west of the Rocky Mountains.[162] In 1980 Granite Rock applied for a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to begin excavating a 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) quarry on the south face of Pico Blanco within the National Forest boundary.[97]\n\ndoc1157901: Granite. A-type or anorogenic granites are formed above volcanic \"hot spot\" activity and have a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry. These granites are formed by the melting of the lower crust under conditions that are usually extremely dry. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.[10][11]\n\ndoc102110: Hot Coffee mod. In New York, a class action lawsuit was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of \"M\", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of the game, are guilty of deception, false advertising, fraud and abuse. The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.[10]\n\ndoc102124: Hot Coffee mod. On June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the FTC settled. They are required to \"clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority.\" Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in civil penalties.[22]\n\ndoc102119: Hot Coffee mod. On August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory recall for all games still owned by the general public.[citation needed] Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the \"uncensored\" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily. However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have grandfathered these copies of the game to their collection.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1794150: Cold Stone Creamery. The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008, but ended in 2014.[14] Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late 2007.[15] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year-round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[16] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[17]\n\ndoc2438387: Hot 'n Now. In October 2003, Proquest Capital Corporation acquired Hot 'n Now assets and some liabilities from Hot 'n Now, LLC. Proquest was soon renamed to Hot Brands, Inc. At the time of acquisition, the chain had 44 locations, 23 corporate and 21 franchisee owned, in three states: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana.[10]\n\ndoc2205301: History of Arizona. On June 30, 2013, nineteen members of the Prescott Fire Department were killed fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire.[47] The fatalities were members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a hotshot crew,[48] of whom only one survived as they were working in another location.[48]\n\ndoc1957916: Yarnell Hill Fire. On June 30, 19 firefighters with the Prescott Fire Department's interagency Granite Mountain Hotshots were overrun and killed by the fire.[15] Initial reports indicated that one of the firefighters was not a member of the hotshot crew, but Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo later confirmed that all 19 were from the Granite Mountain Hotshots.[16] The firefighters had apparently deployed fire shelters, but not all of the bodies were found inside them.[17] The city of Prescott released the names of the 19 firefighters on July 1.[18]\n\ndoc65808: Firefighting.

The minimum annual-training requirement to maintain firefighting and medical skills is 240 hours per year. Special teams and company-level drills add significantly to that number of hours.[52]\n\ndoc65790: Firefighting. Firefighters typically undergo a high degree of technical training.[1][2] This involves both general firefighting techniques and developing specialist expertise in particular fire operations, such as aircraft firefighting and wildland firefighting In the U.S. the national level of certifications are called Firefighter I/II.\n\ndoc331980: Firefighter. The skills required for safe operations are regularly practiced during training evaluations throughout a firefighter's career. Initial firefighting skills are normally taught through local, regional or state-approved fire academies or training courses.[1] Depending on the requirements of a department, additional skills and certifications such as technical rescue and pre-hospital medicine may also be acquired at this time.\n\ndoc332039: Firefighter. Master of Engineering and two years of departmental training.\n\ndoc2516685: High reliability organization. Although the original research and early application of HRO theory into practice occurred in high risk industries, research today covers a wide variety of applications and settings. Health care has been the largest practitioner area for the past several years.[4] The applications of Crew Resource Management  is another area of focus for leaders in HROs requiring competent behavior systems measurement and intervention.[18]   Wildfires create complex and very dynamic mega-crisis situations across the globe every year. U.S. wildland firefighters, often organized using the Incident Command System into flexible inter-agency incident management teams, are not only called upon to \"bring order to chaos\" in today's huge mega-fires, they also are requested on \"all-hazard events\" like hurricanes, floods and earthquakes.  The U.S. Wildland Fire Lessons Learned Center has been providing education and training to the wildland fire community on high reliability since 2002. HRO behaviors can be recognized and further developed into high-functioning skills of anticipation and resilience. Learning organizations that strive for high performance in things they can plan for, can become HROs that are able to better manage unexpected events that by definition cannot be planned for.\n\ndoc2380437: Bureau of Fire Protection.

Located centrally at the Training Academy on Randall's Island, the Bureau of Training is responsible for all training needs for the Fire Department of New York.[41] Initial training of all firefighter candidates undergo an 18-week academy that consists of classroom education and physical fitness performance.[42]\n\ndoc2001188: Waldo Canyon Fire. The Pikes Peak Community Foundation created The Waldo Canyon Fire Fighter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fund on June 28 to support the efforts of public and volunteer fire departments in El Paso and Teller Counties. This fund provided financial resources for the fire departments for food, cots, firefighting equipment, or future wildfire mitigation efforts in the Pikes Peak region.[30]\n\ndoc2225843: Firefighting in the United States. Firefighting in the United States is becoming more of a profession than it once was. Historically, especially in smaller departments, little formal training of firefighters was required. Now, most states require both career and volunteer firefighters to complete a certificate program at a fire academy. Associate's, bachelor's and master's degree programs in firefighting disciplines are available at colleges and universities. Such advanced training is becoming a de facto prerequisite for command in larger departments. The U.S. Fire Administration operates the National Fire Academy, which also provides specialized firefighter training.\n\ndoc331993: Firefighter. Firefighters in the United States are frequently the first responders to hazardous material fire situations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard 1910.120[4] defines four standards of training first responder awareness level, first responder operations level, hazardous materials technician, and Hazardous materials specialist. EMS-based paramedics are typically trained to the awareness level, whereas career and volunteer firefighters are often trained to the operations level or better. Other nations have trained only elite firefighters and rescuers to do hazmat so that funding and equipment could go to fewer stations. This gives departments elite hazmat personnel and high-grade equipment for an incident. Departments place these companies in stations where they can be very mobile.\n\n"
