        "When did Scotland last qualify for the FIFA World Cup?  I'm interested in the specifics of that qualifying campaign, including the teams they played, their final standings, and the key players and manager involved.  Beyond that, I'd like to know about Scotland's overall World Cup history, focusing on the years they qualified, their performance in each tournament (including group stage results and knockout stage performance, if applicable), and any memorable moments or significant matches. For example, were there any particularly close or dramatic qualifying matches or World Cup games?  Finally, what were the main reasons for Scotland's failure to qualify in the years they missed the World Cup, and were there any significant obstacles or challenges they faced during those periods?\n"

Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\n",

Craig Brown guided Scotland to qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, finishing as the best runners-up. Scotland were drawn against holders Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup.[32] John Collins scored from the penalty spot to level the score at 1\u20131, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2\u20131 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1\u20131 with Norway in Bordeaux,[2] but the final match against Morocco ended in a 3\u20130 defeat.[33] Scotland have not appeared at the World Cup since.\n\ndoc8270: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France.[30] Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1\u20130 to Costa Rica.[31] While they recovered to beat Sweden 2\u20131 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1\u20130 and were once again eliminated after the first round.[31] Goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal.[10]\n\ndoc8269: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc8268: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8263: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years.[10] A \"skilful but fragile\" team lost a play-off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962.[10] A team managed by Jock Stein, but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments, lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament.[10] A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970.[10]\n\ndoc8259: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out;[5] in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed;[6] and in 1982, when the USSR went through.[7] Although Scotland have played at eight finals tournaments, they have qualified on nine occasions. The Scottish Football Association declined to participate in 1950 as Scotland were not the British champions.[8]\n\ndoc8262: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group.

After Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Andy Roxburgh was replaced by Craig Brown as Scotland manager.[3] Brown successfully guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament, in second place behind Russia.[3] The first game at the tournament against the Netherlands ended 0\u20130, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against rivals England at Wembley Stadium.[3] Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2\u20130 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1\u20130 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4\u20130 lead in the other match briefly put both teams in a position to qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were eliminated on goals scored.[3] The Netherlands and Scotland both had four points and a goal difference of minus one.[4]\n\ndoc983194: List of Scottish Cup finals. In 1909 the cup was withheld by the SFA after a riot broke out following a replay between Rangers and Celtic. The first match was drawn 2\u20132 and the second 1\u20131.[7]\n\ndoc8267: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. After taking a single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress.[6] Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever;[19] Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net.[19][24] The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, however, as Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.[6] This performance against strong opponents only heightened the frustration at the poor results earlier in the competition.[10] MacLeod initially retained his position, but resigned later that year.[10]\n\ndoc176096: Scotland national rugby union team. The Scottish rugby team dates back to 1871, where they beat England in the first international rugby union match at Raeburn Place. Scotland competed in the Five Nations from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright\u2014including the last ever Five Nations in 1999\u2014and sharing it another 8. In 2000 the competition accepted a sixth competitor, Italy, thus forming the Six Nations. Since this change, Scotland have yet to win the competition. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all eight competitions, the most recent being in 2015 where they were knocked out by Australia at the quarter-final stage in controversial circumstances. Their best finish came in 1991, where they lost to the All Blacks in the third place play-off.\n\ndoc1072912: 1998 FIFA World Cup. Scotland managed only one point, coming in a 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 draw against Norway, and failed to get out of the first round for an eighth time in the FIFA World Cup, a record that stands to this date.\n\ndoc176135: Scotland national rugby union team. In the 2017 Six Nations, Scotland saw a marked improvement in performance with three home wins and two away defeats. This was Vern Cotter's last tournament as head coach of Scotland, despite their also beating Australia 24-19 on the summer tour of the Southern Hemisphere. In their first 6Ns game, Scotland went in with confidence to win their first opening match for eleven years against Ireland in a close match at Murrayfield Stadium.[101][102] This followed with a defeat in Paris to France. Scotland secured a win over Wales in their third game, Scotland's first since 2007. In the eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup tie against England at Twickenham,[103] however, Scotland were thrashed 61-21.[104] This was a record defeat against the English, and a result which ended their hopes of winning the Six Nations.[104] In the last week, Scotland defeated Italy at Murrayfield with a 29-0 victory, securing fourth place in the tournament table.[105]\n\ndoc2265552: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Football Association was founded in 1873 and the Scottish Cup was created as an annual competition for its members.[21] The first Scottish Cup match took place on 18 October 1873 when Renton defeated Kilmarnock FC 2\u20130 in the first round.[22] In its early years the competition was dominated by Queen's Park who won the final 10 times in the first twenty years.[23] Vale of Leven, Dumbarton and Renton were also successful during this period.[4] In 1885, the record margin of victory in the tournament was recorded when Arbroath defeated Bon Accord 36\u20130 in a first round match.[4][23]\n\ndoc2457741: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. Scotland long held an advantage in terms of wins, as they recorded ten wins in the first 16 matches. Scotland, the smaller country in terms of population, were superior during this period because passing football developed earlier there, as shown by the Scotch Professors who moved to play in the nascent English professional league during the late 1880s.[59] Scotland were also dominant in the 1920s and 30s and prior to the Second World War had 29 wins in the series to England's 19. England reversed the dominance after the war, as Scotland have only won 12 matches since then. The Scots did win three games out of four from 1974 to 1977, but lost every other game in the 1970s, and have only won three times (compared to 13 English wins) since 1977. England pulled ahead for the first time in the history of the fixture with their win in 1983.\n\ndoc2457722: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. According to The Scotsman newspaper of 2 December 1872, there were only about ten football clubs in Scotland. These early international matches helped to increase the popularity of association football in Scotland.[18] The first official match was held on 30 November 1872, on Scotland's national saint's day, St. Andrew's Day, and it took place at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club.[19][20] The Scotland team was made up entirely of players from Queen's Park,[19] the most successful Scottish club of the period.[20] The game ended a 0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 draw, watched by a crowd of 4000 who had paid a shilling each for admission.[19][20]\n\ndoc1616474: United Kingdom national football team. England have been the only Home Nation to have any major success internationally, winning the 1966 World Cup. Scotland have qualified for the final tournaments of eight World Cups and two European Championships, but have never progressed beyond the group stage of any international tournament.  Northern Ireland have not qualified for a World Cup finals tournament since 1986, and Wales since 1958.\n\n"

Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France.[30] Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1\u20130 to Costa Rica.[31] While they recovered to beat Sweden 2\u20131 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1\u20130 and were once again eliminated after the first round.[31] Goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal.[10]\n\ndoc8269: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc8268: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8263: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years.[10] A \"skilful but fragile\" team lost a play-off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962.[10] A team managed by Jock Stein, but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments, lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament.[10] A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970.[10]\n\ndoc8259: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup.

Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\n"

Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8269: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc176145: Scotland national rugby union team.

Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\n"

Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\n",

Craig Brown guided Scotland to qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, finishing as the best runners-up. Scotland were drawn against holders Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup.[32] John Collins scored from the penalty spot to level the score at 1\u20131, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2\u20131 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1\u20131 with Norway in Bordeaux,[2] but the final match against Morocco ended in a 3\u20130 defeat.[33] Scotland have not appeared at the World Cup since.\n\ndoc8270: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France.[30] Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1\u20130 to Costa Rica.[31] While they recovered to beat Sweden 2\u20131 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1\u20130 and were once again eliminated after the first round.[31] Goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal.[10]\n\ndoc8269: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc8268: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8263: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years.[10] A \"skilful but fragile\" team lost a play-off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962.[10] A team managed by Jock Stein, but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments, lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament.[10] A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970.[10]\n\ndoc8259: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out;[5] in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed;[6] and in 1982, when the USSR went through.[7] Although Scotland have played at eight finals tournaments, they have qualified on nine occasions. The Scottish Football Association declined to participate in 1950 as Scotland were not the British champions.[8]\n\ndoc8262: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhen did Scotland last qualify for the FIFA World Cup, and what were the results of their matches in that tournament?

Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\n",

Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhen did Scotland last qualify for the FIFA World Cup, and what were the results of their matches in that tournament?

Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France.[30] Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1\u20130 to Costa Rica.[31] While they recovered to beat Sweden 2\u20131 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1\u20130 and were once again eliminated after the first round.[31] Goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal.[10]\n\ndoc8269: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc8268: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8263: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years.[10] A \"skilful but fragile\" team lost a play-off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962.[10] A team managed by Jock Stein, but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments, lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament.[10] A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970.[10]\n\ndoc8259: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out;[5] in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed;[6] and in 1982, when the USSR went through.[7] Although Scotland have played at eight finals tournaments, they have qualified on nine occasions. The Scottish Football Association declined to participate in 1950 as Scotland were not the British champions.[8]\n\ndoc1378206: List of Scotland international footballers. The Scotland national football team is the joint-oldest international football team, having played in the first official international match, a goalless draw on 30 November 1872 against England.[1]  Since then, the team has established a long-standing rivalry with England, particularly in the annual British Home Championship, which Scotland won 24 times outright and shared a further 17 times.[2] The team has enjoyed less success in continental and global competition. Even though Scotland has participated in eight FIFA World Cup and two UEFA European Championship final tournaments,[3] the team has never progressed beyond the first round of any major tournament.[3]\n\ndoc506797: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Scotland have participated in two UEFA European Football Championships finals, those held in 1992 and 1996. They have played six matches: winning two, drawing one and losing three. They have scored four goals and conceded five.\n\ndoc506798: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Under the guidance of manager Andy Roxburgh, Scotland qualified for the UEFA European Championship for the first time in 1992.[1] A 1\u20130 defeat to Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1\u20131 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through as group winners.[2] Despite competing well in defeats against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the CIS, the team was knocked out at the group stage.[2]\n\ndoc176145: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland has competed in every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987. Their best finish was fourth in 1991.[38] In their semi-final on 26 October 1991 Scotland lost 6\u20139 to England at Murrayfield after Gavin Hastings missed a penalty almost in front of and a short distance from the posts. On 30 October Scotland lost the third-place play-off to New Zealand in Cardiff 13\u20136.[38] Since then they have qualified for the quarter-finals in all but one occasion, in 2011.[80] Their most recent world cup campaign in 2015 saw them come within 30 seconds of a famous win over Australia, however a last minute penalty sealed the win for the Wallabies.[95]\n\ndoc8262: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\n",

After Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Andy Roxburgh was replaced by Craig Brown as Scotland manager.[3] Brown successfully guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament, in second place behind Russia.[3] The first game at the tournament against the Netherlands ended 0\u20130, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against rivals England at Wembley Stadium.[3] Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2\u20130 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1\u20130 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4\u20130 lead in the other match briefly put both teams in a position to qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were eliminated on goals scored.[3] The Netherlands and Scotland both had four points and a goal difference of minus one.[4]\n\ndoc983194: List of Scottish Cup finals. In 1909 the cup was withheld by the SFA after a riot broke out following a replay between Rangers and Celtic. The first match was drawn 2\u20132 and the second 1\u20131.[7]\n\ndoc8267: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. After taking a single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress.[6] Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever;[19] Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net.[19][24] The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, however, as Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.[6] This performance against strong opponents only heightened the frustration at the poor results earlier in the competition.[10] MacLeod initially retained his position, but resigned later that year.[10]\n\ndoc176096: Scotland national rugby union team. The Scottish rugby team dates back to 1871, where they beat England in the first international rugby union match at Raeburn Place. Scotland competed in the Five Nations from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright\u2014including the last ever Five Nations in 1999\u2014and sharing it another 8. In 2000 the competition accepted a sixth competitor, Italy, thus forming the Six Nations. Since this change, Scotland have yet to win the competition. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all eight competitions, the most recent being in 2015 where they were knocked out by Australia at the quarter-final stage in controversial circumstances. Their best finish came in 1991, where they lost to the All Blacks in the third place play-off.\n\ndoc1072912: 1998 FIFA World Cup. Scotland managed only one point, coming in a 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 draw against Norway, and failed to get out of the first round for an eighth time in the FIFA World Cup, a record that stands to this date.\n\ndoc176135: Scotland national rugby union team. In the 2017 Six Nations, Scotland saw a marked improvement in performance with three home wins and two away defeats. This was Vern Cotter's last tournament as head coach of Scotland, despite their also beating Australia 24-19 on the summer tour of the Southern Hemisphere. In their first 6Ns game, Scotland went in with confidence to win their first opening match for eleven years against Ireland in a close match at Murrayfield Stadium.[101][102] This followed with a defeat in Paris to France. Scotland secured a win over Wales in their third game, Scotland's first since 2007. In the eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup tie against England at Twickenham,[103] however, Scotland were thrashed 61-21.[104] This was a record defeat against the English, and a result which ended their hopes of winning the Six Nations.[104] In the last week, Scotland defeated Italy at Murrayfield with a 29-0 victory, securing fourth place in the tournament table.[105]\n\ndoc2265552: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Football Association was founded in 1873 and the Scottish Cup was created as an annual competition for its members.[21] The first Scottish Cup match took place on 18 October 1873 when Renton defeated Kilmarnock FC 2\u20130 in the first round.[22] In its early years the competition was dominated by Queen's Park who won the final 10 times in the first twenty years.[23] Vale of Leven, Dumbarton and Renton were also successful during this period.[4] In 1885, the record margin of victory in the tournament was recorded when Arbroath defeated Bon Accord 36\u20130 in a first round match.[4][23]\n\ndoc2457741: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. Scotland long held an advantage in terms of wins, as they recorded ten wins in the first 16 matches. Scotland, the smaller country in terms of population, were superior during this period because passing football developed earlier there, as shown by the Scotch Professors who moved to play in the nascent English professional league during the late 1880s.[59] Scotland were also dominant in the 1920s and 30s and prior to the Second World War had 29 wins in the series to England's 19. England reversed the dominance after the war, as Scotland have only won 12 matches since then. The Scots did win three games out of four from 1974 to 1977, but lost every other game in the 1970s, and have only won three times (compared to 13 English wins) since 1977. England pulled ahead for the first time in the history of the fixture with their win in 1983.\n\ndoc2457722: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. According to The Scotsman newspaper of 2 December 1872, there were only about ten football clubs in Scotland. These early international matches helped to increase the popularity of association football in Scotland.[18] The first official match was held on 30 November 1872, on Scotland's national saint's day, St. Andrew's Day, and it took place at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club.[19][20] The Scotland team was made up entirely of players from Queen's Park,[19] the most successful Scottish club of the period.[20] The game ended a 0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 draw, watched by a crowd of 4000 who had paid a shilling each for admission.[19][20]\n\ndoc1616474: United Kingdom national football team. England have been the only Home Nation to have any major success internationally, winning the 1966 World Cup. Scotland have qualified for the final tournaments of eight World Cups and two European Championships, but have never progressed beyond the group stage of any international tournament.  Northern Ireland have not qualified for a World Cup finals tournament since 1986, and Wales since 1958.\n\n"

Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out;[5] in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed;[6] and in 1982, when the USSR went through.[7] Although Scotland have played at eight finals tournaments, they have qualified on nine occasions. The Scottish Football Association declined to participate in 1950 as Scotland were not the British champions.[8]\n\ndoc8271: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Craig Brown guided Scotland to qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, finishing as the best runners-up. Scotland were drawn against holders Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup.[32] John Collins scored from the penalty spot to level the score at 1\u20131, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2\u20131 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1\u20131 with Norway in Bordeaux,[2] but the final match against Morocco ended in a 3\u20130 defeat.[33] Scotland have not appeared at the World Cup since.\n\ndoc8263: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years.[10] A \"skilful but fragile\" team lost a play-off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962.[10] A team managed by Jock Stein, but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments, lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament.[10] A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970.[10]\n\ndoc8270: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France.[30] Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1\u20130 to Costa Rica.[31] While they recovered to beat Sweden 2\u20131 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1\u20130 and were once again eliminated after the first round.[31] Goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal.[10]\n\ndoc506798: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Under the guidance of manager Andy Roxburgh, Scotland qualified for the UEFA European Championship for the first time in 1992.[1] A 1\u20130 defeat to Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1\u20131 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through as group winners.[2] Despite competing well in defeats against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the CIS, the team was knocked out at the group stage.[2]\n\ndoc1378206: List of Scotland international footballers. The Scotland national football team is the joint-oldest international football team, having played in the first official international match, a goalless draw on 30 November 1872 against England.[1]  Since then, the team has established a long-standing rivalry with England, particularly in the annual British Home Championship, which Scotland won 24 times outright and shared a further 17 times.[2] The team has enjoyed less success in continental and global competition. Even though Scotland has participated in eight FIFA World Cup and two UEFA European Championship final tournaments,[3] the team has never progressed beyond the first round of any major tournament.[3]\n\ndoc8268: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8269: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc176145: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland has competed in every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987.

On 30 October Scotland lost the third-place play-off to New Zealand in Cardiff 13\u20136.[38] Since then they have qualified for the quarter-finals in all but one occasion, in 2011.[80] Their most recent world cup campaign in 2015 saw them come within 30 seconds of a famous win over Australia, however a last minute penalty sealed the win for the Wallabies.[95]\n\ndoc506797: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. Scotland have participated in two UEFA European Football Championships finals, those held in 1992 and 1996. They have played six matches: winning two, drawing one and losing three.

Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8258: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world, having been founded in 1873. Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow. Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups,[2] including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament, FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide \"broken-time\" payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA.[3] As a result, Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946.[4]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc983195: List of Scottish Cup finals. The cup was not competed for between 1914 and 1919 due to World War I. World War II prevented competition between 1939 and 1945 although the Scottish War Emergency Cup was held in the 1939\u201340 season.\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc425642: Old Firm. Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).\n\ndoc983193: List of Scottish Cup finals. At the time of the cup's first season Queen's Park were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them until 1875, eight years after their formation.[2] This early dominance meant they were invited into the first FA Cup season and in season 1883\u201384 they came close to a cup double, winning the Scottish Cup but losing the FA Cup Final to Blackburn Rovers.[3] They again met Blackburn Rovers in the following season's Final but were defeated once again.[4] Other Scottish teams competed in the FA Cup such as Partick Thistle and 3rd Lanark RV and continued to compete until 1887, when the Scottish Football Association banned its members from taking any further part in the \"English Cup\".[5] By the time the Scottish Football League was founded in the 1890\u201391 season Queen's Park had been eclipsed by many of the league clubs, they finally agreed to enter the competition in the 1900\u201301 season, they finished seventh in their first season.[6] Their demise was reflected in their Scottish Cup results, although they reached 4 Finals after the foundation of the league they could only win one and their 1893 success was their last, reaching only one more final in 1900. Dumbarton filled the void left by Queen's Park for a time but like all Scottish football competitions the Scottish Cup would come to be dominated by the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers.\n\ndoc176134: Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s.[97] The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36\u201320 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries.[98] Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29\u201318 win. It was Scotland's first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against Les Bleus.[99] Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches),[100] and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).[citation needed]\n\ndoc2247777: Wales at the FIFA World Cup. The 1949\u201350 British Home Championship was used as the qualifying group for the four British teams ahead of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the top two qualifying for the finals in Brazil. Defeats for Wales in their first two matches against England (4\u20131 at home) and Scotland (2\u20130 away) meant Wales were no longer able to qualify regardless of the result in their final game against Ireland (IFA). Despite finishing in second place and thus qualifying for the finals, Scotland declined to travel to Brazil, but instead of retaining two British qualifiers and inviting either Wales or Ireland to replace the Scots, FIFA invited France, Portugal and the other Ireland team to participate. Only France accepted, but they ultimately also pulled out.\n\n",

With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper.[27] The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.[27] His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.[25] Scotland qualified by winning 2\u20130 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany.[10][28] Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.[29]\n\ndoc8268: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978.[25] After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship,[18] Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process.[26] They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union.[10] Scotland beat New Zealand by 5\u20132 in their first game, but then lost 4\u20131 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falc\u00e3o.[7] Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.[10]\n\ndoc8263: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years.[10] A \"skilful but fragile\" team lost a play-off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962.[10] A team managed by Jock Stein, but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments, lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament.[10] A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970.[10]\n\ndoc8259: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out;[5] in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed;[6] and in 1982, when the USSR went through.[7] Although Scotland have played at eight finals tournaments, they have qualified on nine occasions. The Scottish Football Association declined to participate in 1950 as Scotland were not the British champions.[8]\n\ndoc8262: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain.[10] Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.[10] In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia.[10] Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team.[10] Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.[10] They exited the competition after also losing to France.[10]\n\ndoc8261: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953\u201354 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\".[12] The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament.[13][14] Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives.[13] Scotland lost 1\u20130 against Austria in their first game in the finals.[14] After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay.[10][15][14] Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7\u20130.[10][12][16][14]\n\ndoc8264: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament.[17] The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference.[10][17] After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin.[5] This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised.[10]\n\ndoc8260: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players.[9] The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War.[9] The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949\u201350 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition.[10] Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1\u20130 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up.[10] The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players.[10][11] Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.[10]\n\ndoc506799: Scotland at the UEFA European Championship. After Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Andy Roxburgh was replaced by Craig Brown as Scotland manager.[3] Brown successfully guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament, in second place behind Russia.[3] The first game at the tournament against the Netherlands ended 0\u20130, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against rivals England at Wembley Stadium.[3] Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2\u20130 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1\u20130 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4\u20130 lead in the other match briefly put both teams in a position to qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were eliminated on goals scored.[3] The Netherlands and Scotland both had four points and a goal difference of minus one.[4]\n\ndoc983194: List of Scottish Cup finals. In 1909 the cup was withheld by the SFA after a riot broke out following a replay between Rangers and Celtic. The first match was drawn 2\u20132 and the second 1\u20131.[7]\n\ndoc8267: Scotland at the FIFA World Cup. After taking a single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress.[6] Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever;[19] Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net.[19][24] The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, however, as Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.[6] This performance against strong opponents only heightened the frustration at the poor results earlier in the competition.[10] MacLeod initially retained his position, but resigned later that year.[10]\n\ndoc176096: Scotland national rugby union team. The Scottish rugby team dates back to 1871, where they beat England in the first international rugby union match at Raeburn Place. Scotland competed in the Five Nations from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright\u2014including the last ever Five Nations in 1999\u2014and sharing it another 8. In 2000 the competition accepted a sixth competitor, Italy, thus forming the Six Nations. Since this change, Scotland have yet to win the competition. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all eight competitions, the most recent being in 2015 where they were knocked out by Australia at the quarter-final stage in controversial circumstances. Their best finish came in 1991, where they lost to the All Blacks in the third place play-off.\n\ndoc1072912: 1998 FIFA World Cup. Scotland managed only one point, coming in a 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 draw against Norway, and failed to get out of the first round for an eighth time in the FIFA World Cup, a record that stands to this date.\n\ndoc176135: Scotland national rugby union team. In the 2017 Six Nations, Scotland saw a marked improvement in performance with three home wins and two away defeats. This was Vern Cotter's last tournament as head coach of Scotland, despite their also beating Australia 24-19 on the summer tour of the Southern Hemisphere. In their first 6Ns game, Scotland went in with confidence to win their first opening match for eleven years against Ireland in a close match at Murrayfield Stadium.[101][102] This followed with a defeat in Paris to France. Scotland secured a win over Wales in their third game, Scotland's first since 2007. In the eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup tie against England at Twickenham,[103] however, Scotland were thrashed 61-21.[104] This was a record defeat against the English, and a result which ended their hopes of winning the Six Nations.[104] In the last week, Scotland defeated Italy at Murrayfield with a 29-0 victory, securing fourth place in the tournament table.[105]\n\ndoc2265552: Scottish Cup. The Scottish Football Association was founded in 1873 and the Scottish Cup was created as an annual competition for its members.[21] The first Scottish Cup match took place on 18 October 1873 when Renton defeated Kilmarnock FC 2\u20130 in the first round.[22] In its early years the competition was dominated by Queen's Park who won the final 10 times in the first twenty years.[23] Vale of Leven, Dumbarton and Renton were also successful during this period.[4] In 1885, the record margin of victory in the tournament was recorded when Arbroath defeated Bon Accord 36\u20130 in a first round match.[4][23]\n\ndoc2457741: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. Scotland long held an advantage in terms of wins, as they recorded ten wins in the first 16 matches. Scotland, the smaller country in terms of population, were superior during this period because passing football developed earlier there, as shown by the Scotch Professors who moved to play in the nascent English professional league during the late 1880s.[59] Scotland were also dominant in the 1920s and 30s and prior to the Second World War had 29 wins in the series to England's 19. England reversed the dominance after the war, as Scotland have only won 12 matches since then. The Scots did win three games out of four from 1974 to 1977, but lost every other game in the 1970s, and have only won three times (compared to 13 English wins) since 1977. England pulled ahead for the first time in the history of the fixture with their win in 1983.\n\ndoc2457722: England\u2013Scotland football rivalry. According to The Scotsman newspaper of 2 December 1872, there were only about ten football clubs in Scotland. These early international matches helped to increase the popularity of association football in Scotland.[18] The first official match was held on 30 November 1872, on Scotland's national saint's day, St. Andrew's Day, and it took place at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club.[19][20] The Scotland team was made up entirely of players from Queen's Park,[19] the most successful Scottish club of the period.[20] The game ended a 0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 draw, watched by a crowd of 4000 who had paid a shilling each for admission.[19][20]\n\ndoc1616474: United Kingdom national football team. England have been the only Home Nation to have any major success internationally, winning the 1966 World Cup. Scotland have qualified for the final tournaments of eight World Cups and two European Championships, but have never progressed beyond the group stage of any international tournament.  Northern Ireland have not qualified for a World Cup finals tournament since 1986, and Wales since 1958.\n\n"
