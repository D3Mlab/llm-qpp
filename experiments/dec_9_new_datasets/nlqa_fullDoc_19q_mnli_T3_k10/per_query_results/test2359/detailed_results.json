Doreen Mantle (born 1926) is a South African-born[1] English actress who is probably best known for her role as Jean Warboys in One Foot in the Grave (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000).[2]\n\ndoc486894: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mrs Warboys.\n\ndoc574636: One Foot in the Grave. Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Victor and Margaret Meldrew. Victor appears to be alive but Margaret does not acknowledge him, implying that he is actually a ghost after she complains about a cold air in the room.\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\n",

Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc486892: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Writer David Renwick makes a cameo appearance on Victor's TV, alongside presenter Lorraine Kelly, as a gentleman being interviewed for a feature on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\ndoc486884: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\n",

Doreen Mantle (born 1926) is a South African-born[1] English actress who is probably best known for her role as Jean Warboys in One Foot in the Grave (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000).[2]\n\ndoc574636: One Foot in the Grave. Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc486894: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mrs Warboys.\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement.

Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor.

When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574647: One Foot in the Grave. Cousin Wilfred (John Rutland) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs. Warboys' cousin, Wilfred, appeared twice in the series, and was considered to be a fairly boring middle-aged man. In the final series the character returned, but the effects of a stroke rendered him mute, and forced him to \"speak\" with the aid of an electronic voice generator. His poor typing on the generator led to several misunderstandings, such as asking Victor for a \"bra of soup\" (as opposed to a \"bar of soap\") and describing a visit to his \"brothel\" (as opposed to \"brother\").\n\ndoc574643: One Foot in the Grave. New neighbours Derek and Betty McVitie replaced the Trenches for the 1997 special \"Endgame\", however this turned out to be their only appearances in the series and they were said to have emigrated by the penultimate episode which caused Nick Swainey to leap straight in with the offer for their old house. Series six saw the Trenches return as prominent characters, albeit living in a house some distance from the Meldrews. Despite appearing in five out of six series and three Christmas specials, neither of the Trenches ever share a scene with Mrs Warboys, and Pippa only ever shares one scene with Nick Swainey (in the episode \"Who Will Buy?\").\n\ndoc363782: Angus Deayton. He also played Victor Meldrew's long-suffering neighbour Patrick Trench in the comedy series One Foot in the Grave, and George Windsor in the final three series of Waterloo Road.\n\ndoc574632: One Foot in the Grave. Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) \u2013 Victor is the main protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself constantly battling against all that life throws at him as he becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser.[11] From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after an automatic security system made him redundant at the office where he worked as a security guard, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor does not see himself as retired and is always trying to find another job, but all his attempts end in failure. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite fa\u00e7ade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. \"Victor-isms\" include \"I do not believe it!\", \"I don't believe it!\", \"Un-be-lievable!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?\", \"In the name of sanity!\". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassion\u2014in \"Hearts of Darkness\" he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in \"Descent Into The Maelstrom\" he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 42 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says \"You were always my first choice\", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode \"The Wisdom of the Witch\" in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, out of the window of the house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.\n\ndoc574642: One Foot in the Grave. Pippa Trench (n\u00e9e Croker) (Janine Duvitski) \u2013 Patrick's wife sought friendly relations with the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men to make peace with each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home, thinking they were removal men who had initially come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a house clearance firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a \"gormless twerp\" on an answering machine message, unaware she was listening)\u00a0\u2013 for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one domino in his hand, and Victor had two pimples on his nose.\n\ndoc366238: Enn Reitel. He also played two roles in different episodes of long-running sitcom One Foot in the Grave. In the first Christmas special, he played \"Mr. Starkey\", a down and out who holds Victor Meldrew and his neighbour's father at gunpoint to wait for Armageddon on Christmas Day. In the second episode of series 3, \"Dreamland\", he played a tramp who took a fancy to Victor's shoes, but drew the line at his Noel Edmonds-esque sweater.\n\ndoc2534854: Emily Head. In December 2011, Head played Melissa Milcote in the Bristol Old Vic production of Helen Edmundson's Coram Boy at the Colston Hall in Bristol.[8]\n\ndoc486885: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Cousin Wilfred and Ronnie and Mildred.\n\ndoc486882: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Nick Swainey (and his unseen mother) become the Meldrews' next door neighbours with this episode.\n\ndoc574638: One Foot in the Grave. Despite being friends, she has driven Margaret to distraction on several occasions. Most notably in \"Only a Story\", when she stayed with the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret to the point of distraction with her complaining and laziness. Jean was also shown as a somewhat absent-minded character, as she has a pet cockatiel despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while having a conversation with someone else. Doreen Mantle described her character as \"wanting to do the right thing but always finding out that it was the wrong thing\".[12]\n\n"

NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Victor and Margaret Meldrew. Victor appears to be alive but Margaret does not acknowledge him, implying that he is actually a ghost after she complains about a cold air in the room.\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\n"

Doreen Mantle (born 1926) is a South African-born[1] English actress who is probably best known for her role as Jean Warboys in One Foot in the Grave (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000).[2]\n\ndoc486894: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mrs Warboys.\n\ndoc574636: One Foot in the Grave. Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Victor and Margaret Meldrew. Victor appears to be alive but Margaret does not acknowledge him, implying that he is actually a ghost after she complains about a cold air in the room.\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\n"

Doreen Mantle (born 1926) is a South African-born[1] English actress who is probably best known for her role as Jean Warboys in One Foot in the Grave (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000).[2]\n\ndoc486894: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mrs Warboys.\n\ndoc574636: One Foot in the Grave. Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Victor and Margaret Meldrew. Victor appears to be alive but Margaret does not acknowledge him, implying that he is actually a ghost after she complains about a cold air in the room.\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\n",

Doreen Mantle (born 1926) is a South African-born[1] English actress who is probably best known for her role as Jean Warboys in One Foot in the Grave (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000).[2]\n\ndoc574636: One Foot in the Grave. Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc486894: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mrs Warboys.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Victor and Margaret Meldrew. Victor appears to be alive but Margaret does not acknowledge him, implying that he is actually a ghost after she complains about a cold air in the room.\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc574633: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc486892: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Writer David Renwick makes a cameo appearance on Victor's TV, alongside presenter Lorraine Kelly, as a gentleman being interviewed for a feature on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\ndoc486884: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\n"

Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc574633: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc486892: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Writer David Renwick makes a cameo appearance on Victor's TV, alongside presenter Lorraine Kelly, as a gentleman being interviewed for a feature on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\ndoc486884: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\n"

Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc574633: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc486892: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Writer David Renwick makes a cameo appearance on Victor's TV, alongside presenter Lorraine Kelly, as a gentleman being interviewed for a feature on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\ndoc486884: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\n",

Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave.

Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc486892: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Writer David Renwick makes a cameo appearance on Victor's TV, alongside presenter Lorraine Kelly, as a gentleman being interviewed for a feature on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\ndoc486884: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\n",

In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes.

Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\n",

Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc486892: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Writer David Renwick makes a cameo appearance on Victor's TV, alongside presenter Lorraine Kelly, as a gentleman being interviewed for a feature on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\ndoc486884: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\n",

Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14. Ronnie (Gordon Peters) and Mildred (Barbara Ashcroft) appear in three episodes, though their first appearance is extremely brief.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc574633: One Foot in the Grave. Margaret Meldrew (n\u00e9e Pellow) (Annette Crosbie) \u2013 Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife. Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574647: One Foot in the Grave. Cousin Wilfred (John Rutland) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs. Warboys' cousin, Wilfred, appeared twice in the series, and was considered to be a fairly boring middle-aged man. In the final series the character returned, but the effects of a stroke rendered him mute, and forced him to \"speak\" with the aid of an electronic voice generator. His poor typing on the generator led to several misunderstandings, such as asking Victor for a \"bra of soup\" (as opposed to a \"bar of soap\") and describing a visit to his \"brothel\" (as opposed to \"brother\").\n\ndoc574643: One Foot in the Grave. New neighbours Derek and Betty McVitie replaced the Trenches for the 1997 special \"Endgame\", however this turned out to be their only appearances in the series and they were said to have emigrated by the penultimate episode which caused Nick Swainey to leap straight in with the offer for their old house. Series six saw the Trenches return as prominent characters, albeit living in a house some distance from the Meldrews. Despite appearing in five out of six series and three Christmas specials, neither of the Trenches ever share a scene with Mrs Warboys, and Pippa only ever shares one scene with Nick Swainey (in the episode \"Who Will Buy?\").\n\ndoc363782: Angus Deayton. He also played Victor Meldrew's long-suffering neighbour Patrick Trench in the comedy series One Foot in the Grave, and George Windsor in the final three series of Waterloo Road.\n\ndoc574632: One Foot in the Grave. Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) \u2013 Victor is the main protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself constantly battling against all that life throws at him as he becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser.[11] From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after an automatic security system made him redundant at the office where he worked as a security guard, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor does not see himself as retired and is always trying to find another job, but all his attempts end in failure. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite fa\u00e7ade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. \"Victor-isms\" include \"I do not believe it!\", \"I don't believe it!\", \"Un-be-lievable!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?\", \"In the name of sanity!\". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassion\u2014in \"Hearts of Darkness\" he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in \"Descent Into The Maelstrom\" he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 42 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says \"You were always my first choice\", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode \"The Wisdom of the Witch\" in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, out of the window of the house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.\n\ndoc574642: One Foot in the Grave. Pippa Trench (n\u00e9e Croker) (Janine Duvitski) \u2013 Patrick's wife sought friendly relations with the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men to make peace with each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home, thinking they were removal men who had initially come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a house clearance firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a \"gormless twerp\" on an answering machine message, unaware she was listening)\u00a0\u2013 for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one domino in his hand, and Victor had two pimples on his nose.\n\ndoc366238: Enn Reitel. He also played two roles in different episodes of long-running sitcom One Foot in the Grave. In the first Christmas special, he played \"Mr. Starkey\", a down and out who holds Victor Meldrew and his neighbour's father at gunpoint to wait for Armageddon on Christmas Day. In the second episode of series 3, \"Dreamland\", he played a tramp who took a fancy to Victor's shoes, but drew the line at his Noel Edmonds-esque sweater.\n\ndoc2534854: Emily Head. In December 2011, Head played Melissa Milcote in the Bristol Old Vic production of Helen Edmundson's Coram Boy at the Colston Hall in Bristol.[8]\n\ndoc486885: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Cousin Wilfred and Ronnie and Mildred.\n\ndoc486882: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Nick Swainey (and his unseen mother) become the Meldrews' next door neighbours with this episode.\n\ndoc574638: One Foot in the Grave. Despite being friends, she has driven Margaret to distraction on several occasions. Most notably in \"Only a Story\", when she stayed with the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret to the point of distraction with her complaining and laziness. Jean was also shown as a somewhat absent-minded character, as she has a pet cockatiel despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while having a conversation with someone else. Doreen Mantle described her character as \"wanting to do the right thing but always finding out that it was the wrong thing\".[12]\n\n"

Doreen Mantle (born 1926) is a South African-born[1] English actress who is probably best known for her role as Jean Warboys in One Foot in the Grave (1990\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000).[2]\n\ndoc486894: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearance of Mrs Warboys.\n\ndoc574636: One Foot in the Grave. Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.\n\ndoc486880: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Victor Meldrew, Margaret Meldrew, Mrs Warboys and Nick Swainey.\n\ndoc574627: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits and mishaps of irascible early retiree Victor Meldrew, who after being made redundant from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.[5]\n\ndoc574630: One Foot in the Grave. A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;[9] Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;[10] Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind.[2] The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border.[3] Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\ndoc486897: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Final appearances of Victor and Margaret Meldrew. Victor appears to be alive but Margaret does not acknowledge him, implying that he is actually a ghost after she complains about a cold air in the room.\n\ndoc1738120: Richard Wilson (Scottish actor). Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\n",

Richard Wilson OBE (born Iain Carmichael Wilson;[1] 9 July 1936) is a Scottish actor, theatre director and broadcaster. He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin.\n\ndoc574653: One Foot in the Grave. Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health,[13] and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.[13]\n\ndoc574625: One Foot in the Grave.

Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's antics. However, she is often engulfed in these follies, mishaps and confusion and often vents her anger at Victor. In early episodes, her character acts more as a comic foil to Victor's misfortunes. Examples include fearfully asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because \"she went to the seaside to convalesce\".\n\ndoc574650: One Foot in the Grave. Mrs Birkett (Gabrielle Blunt) An elderly neighbour. She accidentally gets trapped in the Meldrews' loft when Victor closes the trap door whilst she is up there looking for jumble that Margaret has prepared. She continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the series, but is not seen again.\n\ndoc574631: One Foot in the Grave. Despite Margaret's frequent exasperation with her husband's antics, the series shows that the couple have a deep affection for one another. This is demonstrated several times throughout the series.\n\ndoc574637: One Foot in the Grave. She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn \u00c2\u00a3500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.\n\ndoc574664: One Foot in the Grave. Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.[28][29] Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.[30]\n\ndoc574628: One Foot in the Grave. Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.\n\ndoc486877: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life.[2] Most episodes were 30 minutes long, though some were several minutes longer. Christmas editions and other specials were generally longer. Richard Wilson appears in all 42 episodes, and Annette Crosbie in all except the 1993 episode \"The Trial\". The character Jean Warboys, played by Doreen Mantle, appeared in 18 out of 42 episodes, with Nick Swainey, played by Owen Brenman, appearing in 15 episodes, and Patrick and Pippa Trench played by Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski in 14.

NOTE: During the course of this episode, Victor and Margaret make the show's only reference to 'Stuart', during which the episode takes on a more sombre tone. Although it is never established who Stuart is, he is implied to be the Meldrews' son who died as a child.\nThis is the first episode to take place entirely in real time, with each following series containing an episode that does the same.\n\ndoc486878: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. There were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about \"cold air\" beside her.\n\n",

In the final series the character returned, but the effects of a stroke rendered him mute, and forced him to \"speak\" with the aid of an electronic voice generator. His poor typing on the generator led to several misunderstandings, such as asking Victor for a \"bra of soup\" (as opposed to a \"bar of soap\") and describing a visit to his \"brothel\" (as opposed to \"brother\").\n\ndoc574643: One Foot in the Grave. New neighbours Derek and Betty McVitie replaced the Trenches for the 1997 special \"Endgame\", however this turned out to be their only appearances in the series and they were said to have emigrated by the penultimate episode which caused Nick Swainey to leap straight in with the offer for their old house. Series six saw the Trenches return as prominent characters, albeit living in a house some distance from the Meldrews. Despite appearing in five out of six series and three Christmas specials, neither of the Trenches ever share a scene with Mrs Warboys, and Pippa only ever shares one scene with Nick Swainey (in the episode \"Who Will Buy?\").\n\ndoc363782: Angus Deayton. He also played Victor Meldrew's long-suffering neighbour Patrick Trench in the comedy series One Foot in the Grave, and George Windsor in the final three series of Waterloo Road.\n\ndoc574632: One Foot in the Grave. Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) \u2013 Victor is the main protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself constantly battling against all that life throws at him as he becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser.[11] From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after an automatic security system made him redundant at the office where he worked as a security guard, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor does not see himself as retired and is always trying to find another job, but all his attempts end in failure. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite fa\u00e7ade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. \"Victor-isms\" include \"I do not believe it!\", \"I don't believe it!\", \"Un-be-lievable!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?\", \"In the name of sanity!\". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassion\u2014in \"Hearts of Darkness\" he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in \"Descent Into The Maelstrom\" he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 42 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In \"Rearranging the Dust\", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says \"You were always my first choice\", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode \"The Wisdom of the Witch\" in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, out of the window of the house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.\n\ndoc574642: One Foot in the Grave. Pippa Trench (n\u00e9e Croker) (Janine Duvitski) \u2013 Patrick's wife sought friendly relations with the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men to make peace with each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home, thinking they were removal men who had initially come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a house clearance firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a \"gormless twerp\" on an answering machine message, unaware she was listening)\u00a0\u2013 for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one domino in his hand, and Victor had two pimples on his nose.\n\ndoc366238: Enn Reitel. He also played two roles in different episodes of long-running sitcom One Foot in the Grave. In the first Christmas special, he played \"Mr. Starkey\", a down and out who holds Victor Meldrew and his neighbour's father at gunpoint to wait for Armageddon on Christmas Day. In the second episode of series 3, \"Dreamland\", he played a tramp who took a fancy to Victor's shoes, but drew the line at his Noel Edmonds-esque sweater.\n\ndoc2534854: Emily Head. In December 2011, Head played Melissa Milcote in the Bristol Old Vic production of Helen Edmundson's Coram Boy at the Colston Hall in Bristol.[8]\n\ndoc486885: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: First appearances of Cousin Wilfred and Ronnie and Mildred.\n\ndoc486882: List of One Foot in the Grave episodes. NOTE: Nick Swainey (and his unseen mother) become the Meldrews' next door neighbours with this episode.\n\ndoc574638: One Foot in the Grave. Despite being friends, she has driven Margaret to distraction on several occasions. Most notably in \"Only a Story\", when she stayed with the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret to the point of distraction with her complaining and laziness. Jean was also shown as a somewhat absent-minded character, as she has a pet cockatiel despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while having a conversation with someone else. Doreen Mantle described her character as \"wanting to do the right thing but always finding out that it was the wrong thing\".[12]\n\n"
