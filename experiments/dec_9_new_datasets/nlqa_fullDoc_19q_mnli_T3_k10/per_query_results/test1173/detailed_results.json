        "china in chinese is called zhongguo which means",
        "What does the Chinese term \"Zhongguo\" mean, including its historical evolution and different interpretations throughout various dynasties?  Specifically, I'm interested in how its meaning changed from referring to a central region or capital to encompassing the entire country, and how this shift relates to the expansion and contraction of Chinese empires.  I'd also like to know how the term compares to other names for China, such as Zhonghua and Huaxia, and how these terms reflect different aspects of Chinese identity and culture, including the distinctions between Han Chinese and other ethnic groups. Finally,  I'm curious about the use of \"Zhongguo\" in international contexts and treaties, and how its meaning has been translated and interpreted in different languages.\n",
        "What does the Chinese name \"Zhongguo\" (\u4e2d\u56fd) mean, and how has its meaning evolved throughout history?  I'm interested in the etymology of the term, specifically the individual characters \u4e2d (zh\u014dng) and \u56fd (gu\u00f3) and their historical interpretations.  How did the concept of \"Zhongguo\" shift from denoting a central region or cultural core to representing the entire nation-state, and what political, social, and cultural factors influenced this change?  Furthermore, I'd like to understand the relationship between \"Zhongguo\" and other names for China, such as \"Zhonghua\" (\u4e2d\u534e) and \"Huaxia\" (\u534e\u590f), including their usage in different historical periods and their implications for Chinese national identity.  Finally, how has the international community perceived and translated \"Zhongguo,\" and what impact has this had on China's image and diplomatic relations?\n"

From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture.

Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast.

In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments.

There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi.

It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China.

Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc1688043: Tibet. The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc2637964: Manchukuo. The Qing dynasty, which replaced the Shun and Ming dynasties in China, was founded by Manchus from Manchuria (modern Northeast China). The Manchu emperors separated their homeland in Jilin and Heilongjiang from the Han Liaoning province with the Willow Palisade. This ethnic division continued until the Qing dynasty encouraged massive immigration of Han in the 19th century during Chuang Guandong to prevent the Russians from seizing the area from the Qing. After conquering the Ming, the Qing identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Central Realm\") and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu.[19][20][21] The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. The lands in Manchuria were explicitly stated by the Qing to belong to \"China\" (Zhongguo, Dulimbai gurun) in Qing edicts and in the Treaty of Nerchinsk.[22]\n\n",

Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41564: Names of China. The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3).

There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W.

From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhat does the Chinese term \"Zhongguo\" mean, including its historical evolution and different interpretations throughout various dynasties?

The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41598: Names of China. Since its founding in 1912, the Republic of China, or ROC, has sometimes been referred to as \"Republican China\" or \"Republican Era\" (\u6c11\u570b\u6642\u4ee3), in contrast to the empire it replaced, or as \"Nationalist China\", after the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). \u4e2d\u83ef (Zhonghua) is a term that pertains to \"China\" while \u6c11\u570b (m\u00edngu\u00f3), literally \"people's country\", stands for \"republic\".[39][40] With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the Chinese Civil War, the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of Taiwan and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"Taiwan\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See Taiwan Independence.) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War, the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" (\u532a\u5340) by the ROC). In addition, the ROC, due to pressure from the PRC, was forced to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u53f0\u5317) whenever it participates in international forums or most sporting events such as the Olympic Games.\n\ndoc41577: Names of China. Qing official Zhang Deyi objected to the western European name \"China\" and said that China referred to itself as Zhonghua in response to a European who asked why Chinese used the term guizi to refer to all Europeans.[32]\n\ndoc1454202: Taiwan. The official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u570b), to refer to itself, which derives from zh\u014dng (\"central\" or \"middle\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state, nation-state\"), [e] A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty in reference to its royal demesne[f] and the name was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qingera .[34] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as \"Nationalist China\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\").[36] It was a member of the United Nations representing \"China\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People's Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\"[37] The Republic of China participates in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\" due to diplomatic pressure from the People's Republic of China. For instance, it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984, and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.[38]\n\ndoc1713758: Made in China. Made in China or Product of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u5236\u9020; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u88fd\u9020; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u00ecz\u00e0o,) is a country of origin label affixed to products manufactured in the People's Republic of China.\n\ndoc247739: Chinese culture. In modern China, there are 56 officially labelled ethnic groups in China.[12] Throughout history, many groups have merged into neighboring ethnicities or disappeared. At the same time, many within the Han identity have maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions. The term Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\uff0c\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u65cf) has been used to describe the notion of Chinese nationalism in general. Much of the traditional identity within the community has to do with distinguishing the family name.\n\ndoc41581: Names of China. The name Huaxia (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f; pinyin: hu\u00e1xi\u00e0), generally used as a sobriquet in Chinese text, is the combination of two words:\n\ndoc940968: Chinese characters. Zh\u00c3\u00a8ng (unknown meaning)\n\ndoc1872880: Chinese name. More recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of Chinese history. For example, following the victory of the Communists in the Civil War, many Chinese bore \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo (\u5f3a\u56fd, lit. \"Strong Nation\" or \"Strengthening the Nation\") or Dongfeng (\u4e1c\u98ce, lit. \"Eastern Wind\"). Similarly, on Taiwan, it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"Republic of China\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b, Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun (\"Olympics\") also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people's names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and five element practices.\n\ndoc1082067: History of Beijing. In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang moved his capital from Shangjing to Yanjing and the city was renamed Zhongdu (\u4e2d\u90fd) or the \"Central Capital\".[30] For the first time in its history, the city of Beijing became a political capital of a major dynasty.\n\ndoc679367: Names of Japan. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese scribes regularly wrote Wa or Yamato \"Japan\" with the Chinese character \u502d until the 8th century, when the Japanese found fault with it due to its offensive connotation, replacing it with \u548c \"harmony, peace, balance\".  Retroactively, this character was adopted in Japan to refer to the country itself, often combined with the character \u5927, literally meaning \"Great\", so as to write the preexisting name Yamato (\u5927\u548c) (in a manner similar to e.g. \u5927\u6e05\u5e1d\u570b Great Qing Empire, \u5927\u82f1\u5e1d\u570b Greater British Empire).  However, the pronunciation Yamato cannot be formed from the sounds of its constituent characters; it refers to a place in Japan and is speculated to originally mean \"Mountain Gate\" (\u5c71\u6238).[3] Such words which use certain kanji to name a certain Japanese word solely for the purpose of representing the word's meaning regardless of the given kanji's on'yomi or kun'yomi, a.k.a. jukujikun, is not uncommon in Japanese. Other original names in Chinese texts include Yamatai country (\u90aa\u99ac\u53f0\u56fd), where a Queen Himiko lived.  When hi no moto, the indigenous Japanese way of saying \"sun's origin\", was written in kanji, it was given the characters \u65e5\u672c.  In time, these characters began to be read using Sino-Japanese readings, first Nippon and later Nihon, although the two names are interchangeable to this day.\n\n"

The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc41605: Names of China. Sinologists usually use \"Chinese\" in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of Zhongguo, to the Han ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the overseas Chinese.\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture.

Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc1032075: China proper. While the Manchu Qing sought used China (Zhongguo) to describe non-Han areas, however some Han scholar-officials opposed the Qing Manchu Emperor's use of Zhongguo to refer to non-Han areas, using Zhongguo to mark a distinction between the culturally Han Chinese areas and the territory newly brought into the Manchu Qing empire. In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China. Chinese names for China, aside from Zhongguo, include Zhonghua (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), Huaxia (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), Shenzhou (\u795e\u5dde) and Jiuzhou (\u4e5d\u5dde). Han (\u6f22/\u6c49) and Tang (\u5510) are common names given for the Chinese ethnicity. The People's Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) and Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) are the official names for the two contemporary sovereign states currently claiming sovereignty over the traditional area of China. \"Mainland China\" is used to refer to areas under the jurisdiction by the PRC usually excluding Hong Kong and Macau.\n\n"

The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc41605: Names of China. Sinologists usually use \"Chinese\" in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of Zhongguo, to the Han ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the overseas Chinese.\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc1032075: China proper. While the Manchu Qing sought used China (Zhongguo) to describe non-Han areas, however some Han scholar-officials opposed the Qing Manchu Emperor's use of Zhongguo to refer to non-Han areas, using Zhongguo to mark a distinction between the culturally Han Chinese areas and the territory newly brought into the Manchu Qing empire. In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China.

In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments.

                "What does the Chinese term \"Zhongguo\" mean, including its historical evolution and different interpretations throughout various dynasties?  Specifically, I'm interested in how its meaning changed from referring to a central region or capital to encompassing the entire country, and how this shift relates to the expansion and contraction of Chinese empires.  I'd also like to know how the term compares to other names for China, such as Zhonghua and Huaxia, and how these terms reflect different aspects of Chinese identity and culture, including the distinctions between Han Chinese and other ethnic groups. Finally,  I'm curious about the use of \"Zhongguo\" in international contexts and treaties, and how its meaning has been translated and interpreted in different languages.\n"

From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture.

Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689.

In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments.

There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi.

It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China.

Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc1688043: Tibet. The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc2637964: Manchukuo. The Qing dynasty, which replaced the Shun and Ming dynasties in China, was founded by Manchus from Manchuria (modern Northeast China). The Manchu emperors separated their homeland in Jilin and Heilongjiang from the Han Liaoning province with the Willow Palisade. This ethnic division continued until the Qing dynasty encouraged massive immigration of Han in the 19th century during Chuang Guandong to prevent the Russians from seizing the area from the Qing. After conquering the Ming, the Qing identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Central Realm\") and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu.[19][20][21] The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. The lands in Manchuria were explicitly stated by the Qing to belong to \"China\" (Zhongguo, Dulimbai gurun) in Qing edicts and in the Treaty of Nerchinsk.[22]\n\n"

The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc41605: Names of China. Sinologists usually use \"Chinese\" in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of Zhongguo, to the Han ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the overseas Chinese.\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc1032075: China proper. While the Manchu Qing sought used China (Zhongguo) to describe non-Han areas, however some Han scholar-officials opposed the Qing Manchu Emperor's use of Zhongguo to refer to non-Han areas, using Zhongguo to mark a distinction between the culturally Han Chinese areas and the territory newly brought into the Manchu Qing empire. In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China. Chinese names for China, aside from Zhongguo, include Zhonghua (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), Huaxia (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), Shenzhou (\u795e\u5dde) and Jiuzhou (\u4e5d\u5dde). Han (\u6f22/\u6c49) and Tang (\u5510) are common names given for the Chinese ethnicity. The People's Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) and Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) are the official names for the two contemporary sovereign states currently claiming sovereignty over the traditional area of China. \"Mainland China\" is used to refer to areas under the jurisdiction by the PRC usually excluding Hong Kong and Macau.\n\n",

China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41605: Names of China.

In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China.

Han (\u6f22/\u6c49) and Tang (\u5510) are common names given for the Chinese ethnicity.

Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc1688043: Tibet. The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc2637964: Manchukuo. The Qing dynasty, which replaced the Shun and Ming dynasties in China, was founded by Manchus from Manchuria (modern Northeast China). The Manchu emperors separated their homeland in Jilin and Heilongjiang from the Han Liaoning province with the Willow Palisade. This ethnic division continued until the Qing dynasty encouraged massive immigration of Han in the 19th century during Chuang Guandong to prevent the Russians from seizing the area from the Qing. After conquering the Ming, the Qing identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Central Realm\") and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu.[19][20][21] The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. The lands in Manchuria were explicitly stated by the Qing to belong to \"China\" (Zhongguo, Dulimbai gurun) in Qing edicts and in the Treaty of Nerchinsk.[22]\n\n"

                "What does the Chinese name \"Zhongguo\" (\u4e2d\u56fd) mean, and how has its meaning evolved throughout history?  I'm interested in the etymology of the term, specifically the individual characters \u4e2d (zh\u014dng) and \u56fd (gu\u00f3) and their historical interpretations.  How did the concept of \"Zhongguo\" shift from denoting a central region or cultural core to representing the entire nation-state, and what political, social, and cultural factors influenced this change?  Furthermore, I'd like to understand the relationship between \"Zhongguo\" and other names for China, such as \"Zhonghua\" (\u4e2d\u534e) and \"Huaxia\" (\u534e\u590f), including their usage in different historical periods and their implications for Chinese national identity.  Finally, how has the international community perceived and translated \"Zhongguo,\" and what impact has this had on China's image and diplomatic relations?\n"

Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc1688043: Tibet. The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc2637964: Manchukuo. The Qing dynasty, which replaced the Shun and Ming dynasties in China, was founded by Manchus from Manchuria (modern Northeast China). The Manchu emperors separated their homeland in Jilin and Heilongjiang from the Han Liaoning province with the Willow Palisade. This ethnic division continued until the Qing dynasty encouraged massive immigration of Han in the 19th century during Chuang Guandong to prevent the Russians from seizing the area from the Qing. After conquering the Ming, the Qing identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Central Realm\") and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu.[19][20][21] The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. The lands in Manchuria were explicitly stated by the Qing to belong to \"China\" (Zhongguo, Dulimbai gurun) in Qing edicts and in the Treaty of Nerchinsk.[22]\n\n",

Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41564: Names of China. The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China.

From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhat does the Chinese term \"Zhongguo\" mean, including its historical evolution and different interpretations throughout various dynasties?

I'm interested in the etymology of the term, specifically the individual characters \u4e2d (zh\u014dng) and \u56fd (gu\u00f3) and their historical interpretations.  How did the concept of \"Zhongguo\" shift from denoting a central region or cultural core to representing the entire nation-state, and what political, social, and cultural factors influenced this change?  Furthermore, I'd like to understand the relationship between \"Zhongguo\" and other names for China, such as \"Zhonghua\" (\u4e2d\u534e) and \"Huaxia\" (\u534e\u590f), including their usage in different historical periods and their implications for Chinese national identity.  Finally, how has the international community perceived and translated \"Zhongguo,\" and what impact has this had on China's image and diplomatic relations?\n"

From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture.

Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689.

In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments.

There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia.

It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China.

The People's Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) and Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) are the official names for the two contemporary sovereign states currently claiming sovereignty over the traditional area of China. \"Mainland China\" is used to refer to areas under the jurisdiction by the PRC usually excluding Hong Kong and Macau.\n\ndoc41567: Names of China. Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc1688043: Tibet. The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc2637964: Manchukuo. The Qing dynasty, which replaced the Shun and Ming dynasties in China, was founded by Manchus from Manchuria (modern Northeast China). The Manchu emperors separated their homeland in Jilin and Heilongjiang from the Han Liaoning province with the Willow Palisade. This ethnic division continued until the Qing dynasty encouraged massive immigration of Han in the 19th century during Chuang Guandong to prevent the Russians from seizing the area from the Qing. After conquering the Ming, the Qing identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Central Realm\") and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu.[19][20][21] The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. The lands in Manchuria were explicitly stated by the Qing to belong to \"China\" (Zhongguo, Dulimbai gurun) in Qing edicts and in the Treaty of Nerchinsk.[22]\n\n",

Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41564: Names of China. The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3).

There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well.

From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhat does the Chinese term \"Zhongguo\" mean, including its historical evolution and different interpretations throughout various dynasties?

                "What does the Chinese term \"Zhongguo\" mean, including its historical evolution and different interpretations throughout various dynasties?  Specifically, I'm interested in how its meaning changed from referring to a central region or capital to encompassing the entire country, and how this shift relates to the expansion and contraction of Chinese empires.  I'd also like to know how the term compares to other names for China, such as Zhonghua and Huaxia, and how these terms reflect different aspects of Chinese identity and culture, including the distinctions between Han Chinese and other ethnic groups. Finally,  I'm curious about the use of \"Zhongguo\" in international contexts and treaties, and how its meaning has been translated and interpreted in different languages.\n",
                "What does the Chinese name \"Zhongguo\" (\u4e2d\u56fd) mean, and how has its meaning evolved throughout history?  I'm interested in the etymology of the term, specifically the individual characters \u4e2d (zh\u014dng) and \u56fd (gu\u00f3) and their historical interpretations.  How did the concept of \"Zhongguo\" shift from denoting a central region or cultural core to representing the entire nation-state, and what political, social, and cultural factors influenced this change?  Furthermore, I'd like to understand the relationship between \"Zhongguo\" and other names for China, such as \"Zhonghua\" (\u4e2d\u534e) and \"Huaxia\" (\u534e\u590f), including their usage in different historical periods and their implications for Chinese national identity.  Finally, how has the international community perceived and translated \"Zhongguo,\" and what impact has this had on China's image and diplomatic relations?\n"

Sinologists usually use \"Chinese\" in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of Zhongguo, to the Han ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the overseas Chinese.\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc1032075: China proper. While the Manchu Qing sought used China (Zhongguo) to describe non-Han areas, however some Han scholar-officials opposed the Qing Manchu Emperor's use of Zhongguo to refer to non-Han areas, using Zhongguo to mark a distinction between the culturally Han Chinese areas and the territory newly brought into the Manchu Qing empire. In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China.

Sinologists usually use \"Chinese\" in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of Zhongguo, to the Han ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the overseas Chinese.\n\ndoc41579: Names of China. \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" in different languages (see also section on its translation Middle Kingdom)\n\ndoc41580: Names of China. \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in different languages\n\ndoc1032075: China proper. While the Manchu Qing sought used China (Zhongguo) to describe non-Han areas, however some Han scholar-officials opposed the Qing Manchu Emperor's use of Zhongguo to refer to non-Han areas, using Zhongguo to mark a distinction between the culturally Han Chinese areas and the territory newly brought into the Manchu Qing empire. In the early 19th century, Wei Yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shengwuji (Military History of the Qing Dynasty) calls the inner Asian polities guo, while the seventeen provinces of the traditional heartland, that is, \"China proper,\" and three eastern provinces of Manchuria are called \"Zhongguo.\"[16] Some Han Chinese Ming loyalists refused to use Zhongguo to refer to areas outside the borders of the Ming Empire such as outer Mongolia, in effect refusing to acknowledge the Qing state.\n\ndoc41565: Names of China. Chinese names for China, aside from Zhongguo, include Zhonghua (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), Huaxia (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), Shenzhou (\u795e\u5dde) and Jiuzhou (\u4e5d\u5dde). Han (\u6f22/\u6c49) and Tang (\u5510) are common names given for the Chinese ethnicity. The People's Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) and Republic of China (Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) are the official names for the two contemporary sovereign states currently claiming sovereignty over the traditional area of China. \"Mainland China\" is used to refer to areas under the jurisdiction by the PRC usually excluding Hong Kong and Macau.\n\ndoc41567: Names of China. Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc1688043: Tibet. The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc2637964: Manchukuo. The Qing dynasty, which replaced the Shun and Ming dynasties in China, was founded by Manchus from Manchuria (modern Northeast China). The Manchu emperors separated their homeland in Jilin and Heilongjiang from the Han Liaoning province with the Willow Palisade. This ethnic division continued until the Qing dynasty encouraged massive immigration of Han in the 19th century during Chuang Guandong to prevent the Russians from seizing the area from the Qing. After conquering the Ming, the Qing identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Central Realm\") and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu.[19][20][21] The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. The lands in Manchuria were explicitly stated by the Qing to belong to \"China\" (Zhongguo, Dulimbai gurun) in Qing edicts and in the Treaty of Nerchinsk.[22]\n\n",

Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41564: Names of China. The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3).

There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well.

From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture.

In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments.

The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\".

Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41564: Names of China. The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41598: Names of China. Since its founding in 1912, the Republic of China, or ROC, has sometimes been referred to as \"Republican China\" or \"Republican Era\" (\u6c11\u570b\u6642\u4ee3), in contrast to the empire it replaced, or as \"Nationalist China\", after the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). \u4e2d\u83ef (Zhonghua) is a term that pertains to \"China\" while \u6c11\u570b (m\u00edngu\u00f3), literally \"people's country\", stands for \"republic\".[39][40] With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the Chinese Civil War, the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of Taiwan and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"Taiwan\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See Taiwan Independence.) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War, the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" (\u532a\u5340) by the ROC). In addition, the ROC, due to pressure from the PRC, was forced to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u53f0\u5317) whenever it participates in international forums or most sporting events such as the Olympic Games.\n\ndoc41577: Names of China. Qing official Zhang Deyi objected to the western European name \"China\" and said that China referred to itself as Zhonghua in response to a European who asked why Chinese used the term guizi to refer to all Europeans.[32]\n\ndoc1454202: Taiwan. The official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u570b), to refer to itself, which derives from zh\u014dng (\"central\" or \"middle\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state, nation-state\"), [e] A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty in reference to its royal demesne[f] and the name was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qingera .[34] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as \"Nationalist China\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\").[36] It was a member of the United Nations representing \"China\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People's Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\"[37] The Republic of China participates in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\" due to diplomatic pressure from the People's Republic of China. For instance, it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984, and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.[38]\n\ndoc1713758: Made in China. Made in China or Product of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u5236\u9020; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u88fd\u9020; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u00ecz\u00e0o,) is a country of origin label affixed to products manufactured in the People's Republic of China.\n\ndoc247739: Chinese culture. In modern China, there are 56 officially labelled ethnic groups in China.[12] Throughout history, many groups have merged into neighboring ethnicities or disappeared. At the same time, many within the Han identity have maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions. The term Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\uff0c\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u65cf) has been used to describe the notion of Chinese nationalism in general. Much of the traditional identity within the community has to do with distinguishing the family name.\n\ndoc41581: Names of China. The name Huaxia (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f; pinyin: hu\u00e1xi\u00e0), generally used as a sobriquet in Chinese text, is the combination of two words:\n\ndoc940968: Chinese characters. Zh\u00c3\u00a8ng (unknown meaning)\n\ndoc1872880: Chinese name. More recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of Chinese history. For example, following the victory of the Communists in the Civil War, many Chinese bore \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo (\u5f3a\u56fd, lit. \"Strong Nation\" or \"Strengthening the Nation\") or Dongfeng (\u4e1c\u98ce, lit. \"Eastern Wind\"). Similarly, on Taiwan, it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"Republic of China\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b, Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun (\"Olympics\") also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people's names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and five element practices.\n\ndoc1082067: History of Beijing. In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang moved his capital from Shangjing to Yanjing and the city was renamed Zhongdu (\u4e2d\u90fd) or the \"Central Capital\".[30] For the first time in its history, the city of Beijing became a political capital of a major dynasty.\n\ndoc679367: Names of Japan. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese scribes regularly wrote Wa or Yamato \"Japan\" with the Chinese character \u502d until the 8th century, when the Japanese found fault with it due to its offensive connotation, replacing it with \u548c \"harmony, peace, balance\".  Retroactively, this character was adopted in Japan to refer to the country itself, often combined with the character \u5927, literally meaning \"Great\", so as to write the preexisting name Yamato (\u5927\u548c) (in a manner similar to e.g. \u5927\u6e05\u5e1d\u570b Great Qing Empire, \u5927\u82f1\u5e1d\u570b Greater British Empire).  However, the pronunciation Yamato cannot be formed from the sounds of its constituent characters; it refers to a place in Japan and is speculated to originally mean \"Mountain Gate\" (\u5c71\u6238).[3] Such words which use certain kanji to name a certain Japanese word solely for the purpose of representing the word's meaning regardless of the given kanji's on'yomi or kun'yomi, a.k.a. jukujikun, is not uncommon in Japanese. Other original names in Chinese texts include Yamatai country (\u90aa\u99ac\u53f0\u56fd), where a Queen Himiko lived.  When hi no moto, the indigenous Japanese way of saying \"sun's origin\", was written in kanji, it was given the characters \u65e5\u672c.  In time, these characters began to be read using Sino-Japanese readings, first Nippon and later Nihon, although the two names are interchangeable to this day.\n\n"

Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41583: Names of China. Tianxia (\u5929\u4e0b; pinyin: Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0) literally means \"under heaven\"; and Tianchao (\u5929\u671d) means \"Heavenly Dynasty\". These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled Tianxia, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later Zhou Dynasty (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the Qin state).\n\ndoc83152: Qing dynasty. After conquering \"China proper\", the Manchus identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu (Dulimbai means \"central\" or \"middle,\" gurun means \"nation\" or \"state\"). The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\". They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\"[7] or the \"Chinese Empire\"[8]) and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Manchu: \u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873\n\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 \u200d\u1873\n\u202f\u182a\u185d\u1873\u1868\u1865\u185d Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire.[9] In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably.[10]\n\ndoc1408179: Qin dynasty. The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is believed to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by some scholars, who suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin.[49] Others argued for the state of Jing\n\ndoc1688043: Tibet. The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu (Chinese: \u85cf\u533a; pinyin: Z\u00e0ngq\u016b), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, \u533a q\u016b, which means \"area, district, region, ward\". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang (Chinese: \u85cf; pinyin: Z\u00e0ng) although the geographical term X\u012bz\u00e0ng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term X\u012bz\u00e0ng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796\u20131820) through the addition of a prefix meaning \"west\" (\u897f x\u012b) to Zang.\n\ndoc2637964: Manchukuo. The Qing dynasty, which replaced the Shun and Ming dynasties in China, was founded by Manchus from Manchuria (modern Northeast China). The Manchu emperors separated their homeland in Jilin and Heilongjiang from the Han Liaoning province with the Willow Palisade. This ethnic division continued until the Qing dynasty encouraged massive immigration of Han in the 19th century during Chuang Guandong to prevent the Russians from seizing the area from the Qing. After conquering the Ming, the Qing identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, Zhongguo; \"Central Realm\") and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu.[19][20][21] The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \"China\", using \"China\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. The lands in Manchuria were explicitly stated by the Qing to belong to \"China\" (Zhongguo, Dulimbai gurun) in Qing edicts and in the Treaty of Nerchinsk.[22]\n\n",

Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun.[2] It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng (\u4e2d) meaning \"central\" or \"middle\", and gu\u00f3 (\u570b/\u56fd), representing \"state\" or \"states\"; in contemporary usage, \"nation\". Prior to the Qin unification of China \"Zhongguo\" referred to the \"Central States\"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.[3] In later periods, however, \"Zhongguo\" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.[1] Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as \"Han dynasty\" (Hanchao \u6f22\u671d), \"Tang dynasty\" (Tangchao \u5510\u671d), \"The Great Ming\" (Daming \u5927\u660e), \"The Great Qing\" (Daqing \u5927\u6e05), as the case might be. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.[4]\n\ndoc41564: Names of China. The names of China include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b/\u4e2d\u56fd) in its native language. China, the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.[1] It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to Sanskrit. It is also generally thought that the state of Qin that later formed the Qin dynasty is the ultimate source of the name, although there are other suggestions.\n\ndoc1759977: China. The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[32][o] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[p] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[48] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\"[48] and was the source of the English name \"Middle Kingdom\".[50][51] A more literary or inclusive name, alluding to the \"land of Chinese civilization\", is Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u534e).[52] It developed during the Wei and Jin dynasties as a contraction of \"the central state of the Huaxia\".[48] Before the PRC's establishment, the proposed name of the country was the People's Democratic Republic of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn M\u00ednzh\u01d4 G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3) during the first CPPCC held on 15 June 1949.[53][54] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the defeat of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it was also referred to as \"Communist China\" or \"Red China\", to be differentiated from \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\".[55]\n\ndoc41568: Names of China. There were different usages of the term \"Zhongguo\" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the Han dynasty, three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The Shi Jing explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the Records of the Grand Historian uses the concept zhong to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in Tianxia. Three are in Man and Yi. Five are in Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1.\" The Records of the Three Kingdoms uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of Wu and Yue to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e) and Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0 (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f), names for \"China\" that comes from the Xia dynasty.\n\ndoc41570: Names of China. Zhongguo appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from Zhongguo, which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"China proper\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as Zhongguo (see the discussion below).[8]\n\ndoc41575: Names of China. Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (\u4e2d\u570b) and made it \"flexible\" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.[26] Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.[27] The Treaty of Nanking (1842) English version refers to \"His Majesty the Emperor of China\" while the Chinese refers both to \"The Great Qing Emperor\" (Da Qing Huangdi) and to Zhongguo as well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name.

The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhat does the Chinese term \"Zhongguo\" mean, including its historical evolution and different interpretations throughout various dynasties?

The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) has similar language.[4]\n\ndoc41576: Names of China. In the late 19th century the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that \"our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.\" He argued that the other countries of the world \"all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States.\" [28] The Japanese term \"Shina\" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for \"China\". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as Sun Yat-sen, who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used Shina extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped Shina as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with Zhonghua minguo or simply Zhongguo.[29] Liang went on to argue that the concept of tianxia had to be abandoned in favor of guojia, that is, \"nation,\" for which he accepted the term Zhongguo.[30] After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, Zhongguo was also adopted as the abbreviation of Zhonghua minguo.[31]\n\ndoc41606: Names of China. The English translation of \"Zhongguo\" as the \"Middle Kingdom\" appeared via the Portuguese in the 16th century. It became popular in the mid 19th century. Some Western writers use the translation \"central kingdom\" to imply that China has a deeply rooted self-centered psychology as the center of the universe. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.[56] Regarding the accuracy of the translation, Professor Chen Jian writes: \"I believe that 'Central Kingdom' is a more accurate translation for 'Zhong Guo' (China) than 'Middle Kingdom'. The term 'Middle Kingdom' does not imply that China is superior to other peoples and nations around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d China just happens to be located in the middle geographically; the term 'Central Kingdom', however, implies that China is superior to any other people and nation 'under the heaven' and that it thus occupies a 'central' position in the known universe.\"[57] As pointed out by Wilkinson, this point of view neglects the historical usage of the term. Zhongguo was not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the \"Middle Kingdom\" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.[citation needed]\n\ndoc41569: Names of China. From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed \"Zhongguo\" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.[6] In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of \"Zhongguo\" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.[7]\n\ndoc41578: Names of China. In the 20th century after the May Fourth Movement, educated students began to spread the concept of Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 (\u4e2d\u83ef/\u4e2d\u534e), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as \"Chinese\". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" in their official names. Thus, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\" became the common name for both governments. Overseas Chinese are referred to as hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o (\u83ef\u50d1/\u534e\u4fa8), literally \"Chinese overseas\", or hu\u00e1y\u00ec (\u83ef\u88d4/\u534e\u88d4), literally \"Chinese descendant\" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).\n\ndoc41598: Names of China. Since its founding in 1912, the Republic of China, or ROC, has sometimes been referred to as \"Republican China\" or \"Republican Era\" (\u6c11\u570b\u6642\u4ee3), in contrast to the empire it replaced, or as \"Nationalist China\", after the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). \u4e2d\u83ef (Zhonghua) is a term that pertains to \"China\" while \u6c11\u570b (m\u00edngu\u00f3), literally \"people's country\", stands for \"republic\".[39][40] With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the Chinese Civil War, the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of Taiwan and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"Taiwan\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See Taiwan Independence.) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War, the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" (\u532a\u5340) by the ROC). In addition, the ROC, due to pressure from the PRC, was forced to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u53f0\u5317) whenever it participates in international forums or most sporting events such as the Olympic Games.\n\ndoc41577: Names of China. Qing official Zhang Deyi objected to the western European name \"China\" and said that China referred to itself as Zhonghua in response to a European who asked why Chinese used the term guizi to refer to all Europeans.[32]\n\ndoc1454202: Taiwan. The official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u570b), to refer to itself, which derives from zh\u014dng (\"central\" or \"middle\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state, nation-state\"), [e] A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty in reference to its royal demesne[f] and the name was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qingera .[34] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as \"Nationalist China\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\").[36] It was a member of the United Nations representing \"China\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People's Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\"[37] The Republic of China participates in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\" due to diplomatic pressure from the People's Republic of China. For instance, it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984, and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.[38]\n\ndoc1713758: Made in China. Made in China or Product of China (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u5236\u9020; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u88fd\u9020; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u00ecz\u00e0o,) is a country of origin label affixed to products manufactured in the People's Republic of China.\n\ndoc247739: Chinese culture. In modern China, there are 56 officially labelled ethnic groups in China.[12] Throughout history, many groups have merged into neighboring ethnicities or disappeared. At the same time, many within the Han identity have maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions. The term Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\uff0c\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u65cf) has been used to describe the notion of Chinese nationalism in general. Much of the traditional identity within the community has to do with distinguishing the family name.\n\ndoc41581: Names of China. The name Huaxia (\u83ef\u590f/\u534e\u590f; pinyin: hu\u00e1xi\u00e0), generally used as a sobriquet in Chinese text, is the combination of two words:\n\ndoc940968: Chinese characters. Zh\u00c3\u00a8ng (unknown meaning)\n\ndoc1872880: Chinese name. More recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of Chinese history. For example, following the victory of the Communists in the Civil War, many Chinese bore \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo (\u5f3a\u56fd, lit. \"Strong Nation\" or \"Strengthening the Nation\") or Dongfeng (\u4e1c\u98ce, lit. \"Eastern Wind\"). Similarly, on Taiwan, it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"Republic of China\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b, Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3) into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun (\"Olympics\") also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people's names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and five element practices.\n\ndoc1082067: History of Beijing. In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang moved his capital from Shangjing to Yanjing and the city was renamed Zhongdu (\u4e2d\u90fd) or the \"Central Capital\".[30] For the first time in its history, the city of Beijing became a political capital of a major dynasty.\n\ndoc679367: Names of Japan. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese scribes regularly wrote Wa or Yamato \"Japan\" with the Chinese character \u502d until the 8th century, when the Japanese found fault with it due to its offensive connotation, replacing it with \u548c \"harmony, peace, balance\".  Retroactively, this character was adopted in Japan to refer to the country itself, often combined with the character \u5927, literally meaning \"Great\", so as to write the preexisting name Yamato (\u5927\u548c) (in a manner similar to e.g. \u5927\u6e05\u5e1d\u570b Great Qing Empire, \u5927\u82f1\u5e1d\u570b Greater British Empire).  However, the pronunciation Yamato cannot be formed from the sounds of its constituent characters; it refers to a place in Japan and is speculated to originally mean \"Mountain Gate\" (\u5c71\u6238).[3] Such words which use certain kanji to name a certain Japanese word solely for the purpose of representing the word's meaning regardless of the given kanji's on'yomi or kun'yomi, a.k.a. jukujikun, is not uncommon in Japanese. Other original names in Chinese texts include Yamatai country (\u90aa\u99ac\u53f0\u56fd), where a Queen Himiko lived.  When hi no moto, the indigenous Japanese way of saying \"sun's origin\", was written in kanji, it was given the characters \u65e5\u672c.  In time, these characters began to be read using Sino-Japanese readings, first Nippon and later Nihon, although the two names are interchangeable to this day.\n\n"
