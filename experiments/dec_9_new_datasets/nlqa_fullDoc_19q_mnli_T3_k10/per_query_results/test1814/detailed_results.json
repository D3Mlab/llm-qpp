        "what is the main issue behind starlink corn",
        "What were the long-term consequences of the StarLink corn recall, including its impact on consumer confidence, the corn market, and the regulatory landscape for genetically modified organisms (GMOs)?  Specifically, I'm interested in the financial repercussions for companies involved, such as Aventis, and the lasting effects on the public perception of GMO safety and regulation.  Were there any changes made to the approval process for GMO crops following the incident, and what were the long-term health effects, if any, observed in individuals who consumed StarLink corn?  Finally, what were the international implications of the recall, considering the contamination found in countries beyond the United States?\n",
        "What were the specific allergenic concerns associated with the Cry9C protein in StarLink corn, and what scientific evidence supported or refuted these concerns?  How did the regulatory oversight of StarLink corn's approval and use contribute to its presence in the human food chain, and what specific failures in the regulatory process allowed this contamination to occur?  What were the economic impacts of the StarLink corn recall on farmers, food processors (like Kraft and Taco Bell), and the broader agricultural industry, including changes in corn prices and the cost of implementing preventative measures?  Finally, what long-term changes, if any, were implemented to prevent similar contamination incidents involving genetically modified crops, and what are the ongoing debates surrounding the safety and labeling of GMOs in the context of the StarLink incident?\n"

In August 2013, StarLink corn was reported to be found again contaminating some foods in Saudi Arabia.[47]\n\ndoc2393539: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2001, when the Starlink corn recall became public, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was criticized for being slow to react by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety.[480] He also criticized the EPA and Aventis CropScience for statements at the time of the recall, that indicated they did not anticipate that such a thing would happen.[480]\n\ndoc1459231: Maize. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000. She also stated that food safety and legal compliance were Kraft's main priority.[18]\n\n",

StarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing two modifications: a gene for resistance to glufosinate, and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein called Cry9C.[2] Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink, causing heightened regulatory scrutiny.[3] StarLink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems, which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident,[4]:15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply.[4]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[5]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed only.[3][6] StarLink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998. After the incident the company at first tried to get the application for human consumption approved, and then withdrew the product entirely from the market.[4]:15\n\ndoc1902252: Genetically modified maize. StarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop.[98] Starlink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food.[99]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[100]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed.[98][101] Starlink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998.[99]:15\n\ndoc1902256: Genetically modified maize. The US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001.[108]\n\ndoc63819: StarLink corn recall. In 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert was launched by seven organizations (Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Environmental Trust, Organic Consumers Association, Pesticide Action Network North America, and The State PIRGs) to lobby the FDA, Congress and companies to ban or stop using GMOs.[8][9][10] One of their activities was testing food for the presence of GMOs via a lab called Genetic ID, the vice president of which was Jeffrey M. Smith.[11][12]\n\ndoc1902254: Genetically modified maize. Fifty-one people reported adverse effects to the FDA; US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to Starlink.[105] However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.[106]\n\ndoc1902251: Genetically modified maize. In January 2013, the European Food Safety Authority released all data submitted by Monsanto in relation to the 2003 authorisation of maize genetically modified for glyphosate tolerance.[97]\n\ndoc1377423: Taco Bell. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of Taco Bell-branded shells were recalled from supermarkets. The shells contained a variety of genetically modified corn called StarLink that was not approved for human consumption. StarLink was approved only for use in animal feed because of questions about whether it can cause allergic reactions in people.[15] It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type.[16] In 2001, Tricon Global announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.[17]\n\ndoc2393555: Genetically modified food controversies. See Farmer Assurance Provision. (This bill is commonly referred to as the \"Monsanto Protection Act\" by its critics.[517][518][519])\n\ndoc1902216: Genetically modified maize. Genetically modified maize (corn) is a genetically modified crop. Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits, including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow. One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000.\n\ndoc2393449: Genetically modified food controversies. \u00e2\u20ac\u201cAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science[150]\n\n"

In August 2013, StarLink corn was reported to be found again contaminating some foods in Saudi Arabia.[47]\n\ndoc2393539: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2001, when the Starlink corn recall became public, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was criticized for being slow to react by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety.[480] He also criticized the EPA and Aventis CropScience for statements at the time of the recall, that indicated they did not anticipate that such a thing would happen.[480]\n\ndoc1459231: Maize. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000. She also stated that food safety and legal compliance were Kraft's main priority.[18]\n\n"

In August 2013, StarLink corn was reported to be found again contaminating some foods in Saudi Arabia.[47]\n\ndoc2393539: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2001, when the Starlink corn recall became public, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was criticized for being slow to react by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety.[480] He also criticized the EPA and Aventis CropScience for statements at the time of the recall, that indicated they did not anticipate that such a thing would happen.[480]\n\ndoc1459231: Maize. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000. She also stated that food safety and legal compliance were Kraft's main priority.[18]\n\n"

In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time.

In August 2013, StarLink corn was reported to be found again contaminating some foods in Saudi Arabia.[47]\n\ndoc2393539: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2001, when the Starlink corn recall became public, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was criticized for being slow to react by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety.[480] He also criticized the EPA and Aventis CropScience for statements at the time of the recall, that indicated they did not anticipate that such a thing would happen.[480]\n\ndoc1459231: Maize. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000. She also stated that food safety and legal compliance were Kraft's main priority.[18]\n\n",

It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc2393539: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2001, when the Starlink corn recall became public, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was criticized for being slow to react by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety.[480] He also criticized the EPA and Aventis CropScience for statements at the time of the recall, that indicated they did not anticipate that such a thing would happen.[480]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000. She also stated that food safety and legal compliance were Kraft's main priority.[18]\n\ndoc63823: StarLink corn recall. On October 26, 2000 StarLink corn was reported to be found in Japan and South Korea.[4]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 The market and distribution network for corn in the US was thrown into disarray through 2001, as there were no existing means to segregate the grain;[23][24] the disarray eventually eased due to the Aventis' testing and buyback program discussed below.[25]\n\ndoc63824: StarLink corn recall. In January 2001 under a written agreement with 17 US states,[26] Aventis initiated a program called the StarLink Enhanced Stewardship (SES) program, under which StarLink corn, buffer corn, and any corn stored in grain elevators that had become mixed with StarLink, would be bought by Aventis and directed to animal feed and non-food industrial use (e.g. ethanol production); the program included free kits to test for StarLink, and covered costs of cleaning equipment, transport, and storage facilities, as well as increased transportation costs.[27]:193\u00e2\u20ac\u201c95 Aventis estimated the cost would be between $100 million to $1 billion.[28][29][30]\n\ndoc63825: StarLink corn recall. It was estimated that due to grain mixing StarLink corn could have existed in more than 50% of the US corn supply[2] and that overall, the StarLink incident depressed the price of US corn about 7% for about a year.[31]:533\n\ndoc1459231: Maize. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhat were the long-term consequences of the StarLink corn recall, including its impact on consumer confidence, the corn market, and the regulatory landscape for genetically modified organisms (GMOs)?

StarLink corn was subsequently found in food destined for consumption by humans in the US, Japan, and South Korea.[99]:20\u201321 This corn became the subject of the widely publicized Starlink corn recall, which started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain the corn. Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued.[102][103] The registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000. (Pioneer had been bought by AgrEvo which then became Aventis CropScience at the time of the incident,[99]:15\u201316 which was later bought by Bayer[104]\n\ndoc63826: StarLink corn recall. Following the recalls, 51 people reported adverse effects to the FDA; these reports were reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to StarLink.[32] The CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence the reactions these people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the StarLink Bt protein.[33]\n\ndoc63827: StarLink corn recall. The EPA was criticized by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety, who said \"Clearly they didn't do anything here until they became embarrassed.\"[34] The EPA and Aventis were also criticized for statements at the time of the recall that indicated they had no idea such a thing would happen.[35] \"If there has been a violation of our licensing process, then we would have a very great concern,\" was attributed to Stephen Johnson of the EPA. Margaret Gadsby of Aventis was quoted with her earlier statement \"We have difficulty imagining how our corn could end up in the human food supply.\"\n\ndoc63825: StarLink corn recall. It was estimated that due to grain mixing StarLink corn could have existed in more than 50% of the US corn supply[2] and that overall, the StarLink incident depressed the price of US corn about 7% for about a year.[31]:533\n\ndoc63823: StarLink corn recall. On October 26, 2000 StarLink corn was reported to be found in Japan and South Korea.[4]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 The market and distribution network for corn in the US was thrown into disarray through 2001, as there were no existing means to segregate the grain;[23][24] the disarray eventually eased due to the Aventis' testing and buyback program discussed below.[25]\n\ndoc63828: StarLink corn recall. The registration for the StarLink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[36]:7 In February 2001, it was announced that the president, general counsel, and vice president of market development for Aventis CropScience (US), had been fired in response to the recall.[37]\n\ndoc63831: StarLink corn recall. In 2002, Aventis, Garst, Kraft Foods, Azteca Foods, Azteca Milling, and Mission Foods settled a lawsuit brought by two people, and the grandmother of a third, who claimed to have had allergic reactions to StarLink, for $9 million.[41]\n\ndoc63824: StarLink corn recall.

In 2001, when the Starlink corn recall became public, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was criticized for being slow to react by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety.[480] He also criticized the EPA and Aventis CropScience for statements at the time of the recall, that indicated they did not anticipate that such a thing would happen.[480]\n\ndoc1459231: Maize. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000.

StarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing two modifications: a gene for resistance to glufosinate, and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein called Cry9C.[2] Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink, causing heightened regulatory scrutiny.[3] StarLink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems, which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident,[4]:15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply.[4]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[5]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed only.[3][6] StarLink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998. After the incident the company at first tried to get the application for human consumption approved, and then withdrew the product entirely from the market.[4]:15\n\ndoc1902252: Genetically modified maize. StarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop.[98] Starlink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food.[99]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[100]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed.[98][101] Starlink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998.[99]:15\n\ndoc1902256: Genetically modified maize. The US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001.[108]\n\ndoc63819: StarLink corn recall. In 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert was launched by seven organizations (Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Environmental Trust, Organic Consumers Association, Pesticide Action Network North America, and The State PIRGs) to lobby the FDA, Congress and companies to ban or stop using GMOs.[8][9][10] One of their activities was testing food for the presence of GMOs via a lab called Genetic ID, the vice president of which was Jeffrey M. Smith.[11][12]\n\ndoc1902254: Genetically modified maize. Fifty-one people reported adverse effects to the FDA; US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to Starlink.[105] However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.[106]\n\ndoc1902251: Genetically modified maize. In January 2013, the European Food Safety Authority released all data submitted by Monsanto in relation to the 2003 authorisation of maize genetically modified for glyphosate tolerance.[97]\n\ndoc1377423: Taco Bell. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of Taco Bell-branded shells were recalled from supermarkets. The shells contained a variety of genetically modified corn called StarLink that was not approved for human consumption. StarLink was approved only for use in animal feed because of questions about whether it can cause allergic reactions in people.[15] It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type.[16] In 2001, Tricon Global announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.[17]\n\ndoc2393555: Genetically modified food controversies. See Farmer Assurance Provision. (This bill is commonly referred to as the \"Monsanto Protection Act\" by its critics.[517][518][519])\n\ndoc1902216: Genetically modified maize. Genetically modified maize (corn) is a genetically modified crop. Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits, including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow. One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000.\n\ndoc2393449: Genetically modified food controversies. \u00e2\u20ac\u201cAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science[150]\n\n"

In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of food products were recalled due to the presence of Starlink genetically modified corn, which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption, and was subsequently withdrawn from the market.[60]\n\ndoc63834: StarLink corn recall. GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.[44]\n\ndoc212780: Fast food restaurant. In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\ndoc63816: StarLink corn recall. The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption.[1] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\ndoc63833: StarLink corn recall. In 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.[43]\n\ndoc2393490: Genetically modified food controversies. In 2000, Aventis StarLink GM corn was found in US markets and restaurants. It became the subject of a recall that started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain it. StarLink was then discontinued.[175][176] Registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178]\n\ndoc2393458: Genetically modified food controversies. During the Starlink corn recalls in 2000, a variety of GM maize containing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry9C, was found contaminating corn products in U.S. supermarkets and restaurants. It was also found in Japan and South Korea.[173]:20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21 Starlink corn had only been approved for animal feed as the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins raising concerns about its potential allergenicity.[174]:3 In 2000, Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain Starlink, resulting in a recall of those products, and eventually led to the recall of over 300 products.[175][176][177] Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued and the registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.[178] Aid sent by the United Nations and the United States to Central African nations was also found to be contaminated with StarLink corn and the aid was rejected. The U.S. corn supply has been monitored for Starlink Bt proteins since 2001 and no positive samples have been found since 2004.[179] In response, GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005.[180] During the recall, the United States Centers for Disease Control evaluated reports of allergic reactions to StarLink corn, and determined that no allergic reactions to the corn had occurred.[181][182]\n\ndoc2640165: Food allergy. A second concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[82] A second example was the 1998 introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis gene coding for Cry9c protein into Starlink brand corn to provide insect resistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had restricted its use to corn intended as animal feed, but in 2000 it was found in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall, referred to as the StarLink corn recall.[85] At present, prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[83] Finally, there are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[82] According to a 2015 report from the Center for Food Safety, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.[86]\n\ndoc63821: StarLink corn recall. Kraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products.[15][16][17] \u201cAll of us \u2014 government, industry and the scientific community \u2014 need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d said Betsy Holden, Kraft\u2019s chief executive in September 2000.

StarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing two modifications: a gene for resistance to glufosinate, and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein called Cry9C.[2] Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink, causing heightened regulatory scrutiny.[3] StarLink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems, which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident,[4]:15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply.[4]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[5]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed only.[3][6] StarLink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998. After the incident the company at first tried to get the application for human consumption approved, and then withdrew the product entirely from the market.[4]:15\n\ndoc1902252: Genetically modified maize. StarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop.[98] Starlink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food.[99]:14 However, because the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.[100]:3 As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed.[98][101] Starlink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998.[99]:15\n\ndoc1902256: Genetically modified maize. The US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001.[108]\n\ndoc63819: StarLink corn recall. In 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert was launched by seven organizations (Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Environmental Trust, Organic Consumers Association, Pesticide Action Network North America, and The State PIRGs) to lobby the FDA, Congress and companies to ban or stop using GMOs.[8][9][10] One of their activities was testing food for the presence of GMOs via a lab called Genetic ID, the vice president of which was Jeffrey M. Smith.[11][12]\n\ndoc1902254: Genetically modified maize. Fifty-one people reported adverse effects to the FDA; US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to Starlink.[105] However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.[106]\n\ndoc1902251: Genetically modified maize. In January 2013, the European Food Safety Authority released all data submitted by Monsanto in relation to the 2003 authorisation of maize genetically modified for glyphosate tolerance.[97]\n\ndoc1377423: Taco Bell. In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of Taco Bell-branded shells were recalled from supermarkets. The shells contained a variety of genetically modified corn called StarLink that was not approved for human consumption. StarLink was approved only for use in animal feed because of questions about whether it can cause allergic reactions in people.[15] It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type.[16] In 2001, Tricon Global announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.[17]\n\ndoc2393555: Genetically modified food controversies. See Farmer Assurance Provision. (This bill is commonly referred to as the \"Monsanto Protection Act\" by its critics.[517][518][519])\n\ndoc1902216: Genetically modified maize. Genetically modified maize (corn) is a genetically modified crop. Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits, including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow. One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000.\n\ndoc2393449: Genetically modified food controversies. \u00e2\u20ac\u201cAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science[150]\n\n"
