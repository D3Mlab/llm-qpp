Faustina stated that she received the prayer through visions and conversations with Jesus, who made specific promises regarding the recitation of the prayers.[2] Her Vatican biography quotes some of these conversations.[4]\n\ndoc24209: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24192: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24207: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\n",

The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc24211: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The novena intentions for each day are:\n\ndoc2397475: Divine Mercy Sunday. The liturgical celebration of Divine Mercy Sunday reflects the devotional elements of Divine Mercy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first prayer of that Mass beginning with:\n\ndoc2397479: Divine Mercy Sunday. In June 2002, John Paul II granted indulgences to Catholics who recite specific prayers on that day, which were then formally decreed by the Apostolic Penitentiary.[5] The priests are also ordered in that day to lead the prayers in honor of Divine Mercy, inform the parishioners about the Divine Mercy, and hear confessions.[5]\n\ndoc2397470: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday is also the day after the culmination of the novena of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy.[10][11] Faustyna wrote Jesus instructed her that the Feast of Mercy (the Sunday after Easter) be preceded by a Divine Mercy Novena which would begin on Good Friday.[10]\n\ndoc24204: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.[14]\n\ndoc2397474: Divine Mercy Sunday. The devotion to Divine Mercy Sunday grew rapidly after its designation by Pope John Paul II and is now widely celebrated by Catholics.[18] The Divine Mercy image is often carried in processions on Divine Mercy Sunday, and is placed in a location in the church so that it can be venerated by those who attended the Mass.[18]\n\ndoc24206: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet is begun on the short strand of the rosary beads:\n\ndoc24208: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. To conclude:\n\ndoc2397456: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday (also known as the Feast of the Divine Mercy) is celebrated on the Sunday after Easter, the Octave Day of Easter. The feast day is observed by Roman Catholic as well as some Anglicans.[3] It is originally based on the Catholic devotion to the Divine Mercy that Saint Faustyna Kowalska reported as part of her encounter with Jesus, and is associated with special promises from Jesus and indulgences issued by the Church.\n\ndoc2397457: Divine Mercy Sunday. The feast of Divine Mercy, as recorded in the diary of Saint Faustyna, receives from Jesus himself the biggest promises of grace related to the Devotion of Divine Mercy. In specific, Jesus said that a person who goes to sacramental confession (the confession may take place some days before) and receives holy communion on that day, shall obtain the total forgiveness of all sins and punishment. That means each person would go immediately after death to heaven without suffering in purgatory (or hell). Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church grants a plenary indulgence (observing the usual rules) with the recitation of some simple prayers.[4][5][6]\n\n"

Faustina stated that she received the prayer through visions and conversations with Jesus, who made specific promises regarding the recitation of the prayers.[2] Her Vatican biography quotes some of these conversations.[4]\n\ndoc24209: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24192: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24207: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\n"

The Chaplet is prayed daily at the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In the Philippines, Singapore, and Hong Kong the \"3 o'clock Prayer\" is broadcast on radio and television stations daily at 3:00 p.m. In 2000, Pope John Paul II ordained the Sunday after Easter Divine Mercy Sunday, where Roman Catholics remember the institution of the Sacrament of Penance. The hour Jesus died by crucifixion, 3:00 PM (15:00), is called the Hour of Mercy. In a novena, the chaplet is usually said each of the nine days from Good Friday to Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\ndoc24187: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. According to Faustina's visions, written in her diary, the chaplet's prayers for mercy are threefold: to obtain mercy, to trust in Christ's mercy, and to show mercy to others.[6][10][11] Faustina wrote that Jesus promised that all who recite this chaplet at the hour of death or in the presence of the dying will receive great mercy. She wrote that Jesus said:\n\ndoc24197: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer opens each decade of the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24201: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated three times in succession, concludes the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24193: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer is optional, and may be used to begin the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24203: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer is optional, and may be used after the Holy God to end the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24195: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated three times in succession, is also optional, and may be used along with the first opening prayer to begin the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24199: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. This prayer, repeated 10 times in succession, forms the body of each decade of the Chaplet:\n\ndoc24200: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\ndoc24184: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that she received the prayer through visions and conversations with Jesus, who made specific promises regarding the recitation of the prayers.[2] Her Vatican biography quotes some of these conversations.[4]\n\ndoc24209: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24192: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24207: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\n"

In a novena, the chaplet is usually said each of the nine days from Good Friday to Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\ndoc24187: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. According to Faustina's visions, written in her diary, the chaplet's prayers for mercy are threefold: to obtain mercy, to trust in Christ's mercy, and to show mercy to others.[6][10][11] Faustina wrote that Jesus promised that all who recite this chaplet at the hour of death or in the presence of the dying will receive great mercy. She wrote that Jesus said:\n\ndoc24209: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhen should I pray the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, including specific times and days like Divine Mercy Sunday and Fridays at 3 PM, and are there any particular intentions or benefits associated with praying it at those times?

The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24192: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24207: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy.

Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will.

According to Roman Catholic tradition, the chaplet may be said at any time, but it is said especially on Divine Mercy Sunday and Fridays at 3:00 PM. The Chaplet is prayed daily at the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In the Philippines, Singapore, and Hong Kong the \"3 o'clock Prayer\" is broadcast on radio and television stations daily at 3:00 p.m. In 2000, Pope John Paul II ordained the Sunday after Easter Divine Mercy Sunday, where Roman Catholics remember the institution of the Sacrament of Penance. The hour Jesus died by crucifixion, 3:00 PM (15:00), is called the Hour of Mercy. In a novena, the chaplet is usually said each of the nine days from Good Friday to Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\ndoc24187: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. According to Faustina's visions, written in her diary, the chaplet's prayers for mercy are threefold: to obtain mercy, to trust in Christ's mercy, and to show mercy to others.[6][10][11] Faustina wrote that Jesus promised that all who recite this chaplet at the hour of death or in the presence of the dying will receive great mercy. She wrote that Jesus said:\n\ndoc24209: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it.

In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion.

The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy.

The Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24207: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\n\n",

The liturgical celebration of Divine Mercy Sunday reflects the devotional elements of Divine Mercy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first prayer of that Mass beginning with:\n\ndoc2397479: Divine Mercy Sunday. In June 2002, John Paul II granted indulgences to Catholics who recite specific prayers on that day, which were then formally decreed by the Apostolic Penitentiary.[5] The priests are also ordered in that day to lead the prayers in honor of Divine Mercy, inform the parishioners about the Divine Mercy, and hear confessions.[5]\n\ndoc2397470: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday is also the day after the culmination of the novena of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy.[10][11] Faustyna wrote Jesus instructed her that the Feast of Mercy (the Sunday after Easter) be preceded by a Divine Mercy Novena which would begin on Good Friday.[10]\n\ndoc24204: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.[14]\n\ndoc2397474: Divine Mercy Sunday. The devotion to Divine Mercy Sunday grew rapidly after its designation by Pope John Paul II and is now widely celebrated by Catholics.[18] The Divine Mercy image is often carried in processions on Divine Mercy Sunday, and is placed in a location in the church so that it can be venerated by those who attended the Mass.[18]\n\ndoc24206: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet is begun on the short strand of the rosary beads:\n\ndoc24208: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. To conclude:\n\ndoc2397456: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday (also known as the Feast of the Divine Mercy) is celebrated on the Sunday after Easter, the Octave Day of Easter. The feast day is observed by Roman Catholic as well as some Anglicans.[3] It is originally based on the Catholic devotion to the Divine Mercy that Saint Faustyna Kowalska reported as part of her encounter with Jesus, and is associated with special promises from Jesus and indulgences issued by the Church.\n\ndoc2397457: Divine Mercy Sunday. The feast of Divine Mercy, as recorded in the diary of Saint Faustyna, receives from Jesus himself the biggest promises of grace related to the Devotion of Divine Mercy. In specific, Jesus said that a person who goes to sacramental confession (the confession may take place some days before) and receives holy communion on that day, shall obtain the total forgiveness of all sins and punishment. That means each person would go immediately after death to heaven without suffering in purgatory (or hell). Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church grants a plenary indulgence (observing the usual rules) with the recitation of some simple prayers.[4][5][6]\n\n"

The chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\n\ndoc24192: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\n\ndoc24205: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\n\ndoc24185: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\n\ndoc24186: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. On September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\n\ndoc24183: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\n\ndoc24207: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\n\ndoc24191: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\n\ndoc24189: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Faustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\n\ndoc24202: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy.

The liturgical celebration of Divine Mercy Sunday reflects the devotional elements of Divine Mercy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first prayer of that Mass beginning with:\n\ndoc2397479: Divine Mercy Sunday. In June 2002, John Paul II granted indulgences to Catholics who recite specific prayers on that day, which were then formally decreed by the Apostolic Penitentiary.[5] The priests are also ordered in that day to lead the prayers in honor of Divine Mercy, inform the parishioners about the Divine Mercy, and hear confessions.[5]\n\ndoc2397470: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday is also the day after the culmination of the novena of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy.[10][11] Faustyna wrote Jesus instructed her that the Feast of Mercy (the Sunday after Easter) be preceded by a Divine Mercy Novena which would begin on Good Friday.[10]\n\ndoc24204: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.[14]\n\ndoc2397474: Divine Mercy Sunday. The devotion to Divine Mercy Sunday grew rapidly after its designation by Pope John Paul II and is now widely celebrated by Catholics.[18] The Divine Mercy image is often carried in processions on Divine Mercy Sunday, and is placed in a location in the church so that it can be venerated by those who attended the Mass.[18]\n\ndoc24206: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The Chaplet is begun on the short strand of the rosary beads:\n\ndoc24208: Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. To conclude:\n\ndoc2397456: Divine Mercy Sunday. Divine Mercy Sunday (also known as the Feast of the Divine Mercy) is celebrated on the Sunday after Easter, the Octave Day of Easter. The feast day is observed by Roman Catholic as well as some Anglicans.[3] It is originally based on the Catholic devotion to the Divine Mercy that Saint Faustyna Kowalska reported as part of her encounter with Jesus, and is associated with special promises from Jesus and indulgences issued by the Church.\n\ndoc2397457: Divine Mercy Sunday. The feast of Divine Mercy, as recorded in the diary of Saint Faustyna, receives from Jesus himself the biggest promises of grace related to the Devotion of Divine Mercy. In specific, Jesus said that a person who goes to sacramental confession (the confession may take place some days before) and receives holy communion on that day, shall obtain the total forgiveness of all sins and punishment. That means each person would go immediately after death to heaven without suffering in purgatory (or hell). Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church grants a plenary indulgence (observing the usual rules) with the recitation of some simple prayers.[4][5][6]\n\n"
