        "where does the expression go commando come from",
        "What is the etymology of the phrase \"go commando,\" including its earliest known uses, regional variations, and potential connections to military jargon or slang?  I'm interested in understanding the evolution of its meaning, from any possible origins in World War II or the Vietnam War to its popularization in the 1970s and beyond, including its use in popular culture such as the TV show *Friends*.  Are there any documented examples of the phrase's use before its appearance in literature or media, and what are the different interpretations or connotations associated with the term across various demographics and cultures (e.g., the difference between male and female usage, or variations like \"going fommando\")? Finally, are there any other similar slang terms or expressions that describe the same practice of not wearing underwear?\n",
        "I'm researching the origin and evolution of the phrase \"go commando,\" specifically seeking information beyond its appearance in *Friends* and other popular media.  I'm interested in the earliest documented uses, including any potential military connections (e.g.,  Vietnam War soldiers, or World War II slang), and how the term's meaning and usage have changed over time across different demographics and geographic locations.  For example, are there significant differences in how the term is used or understood by men versus women, or in different countries (like the Chilean \"andar a lo gringo\")?  Finally, I'd like to know if there are any related or alternative slang terms for not wearing underwear, and if the phrase's connotations have shifted over time (e.g., from a potentially risqu\u00e9 term to a more commonplace expression).\n"

The origins of the phrase \"go commando\" are uncertain, with some speculating that it may refer to being \"out in the open\" or \"ready for action\".[5]\n\ndoc11256: Going commando. The term appeared in the 1982 novel Groundrush by Greg Barron, in the sentence, \"Bigfoot's jock snapped underneath, leaving him to 'go commando'.\"[9] In the Chicago Tribune of January 22, 1985, Jim Spencer wrote, \"Furthermore, coloured briefs are 'sleazy' and going without underwear ('going commando', as they say on campus) is simply gross.\" The term gained currency in the popular vernacular after appearing in a 1996 episode of Friends.[10][11]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc2546828: Go-go dancing. The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops. A synonym used in Vietnam for go-go dancers is \"table dancer\".\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\n",

The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc182129: Shorts. In British English the term \"short trousers\" has been used, but only for shorts that are a short version of real[clarification needed] trousers (pants), e.g. tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of school uniform for boys up to their early teens,[1][2][3] and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. The American term \"short pants\" is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, there they might now be called \"dress shorts\", a term that has not gained much currency in Britain. A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called \"stubbies\". \"Shorts\" is used unqualified in British English to refer to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts: the last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts. Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\n",

The term appeared in the 1982 novel Groundrush by Greg Barron, in the sentence, \"Bigfoot's jock snapped underneath, leaving him to 'go commando'.\"[9] In the Chicago Tribune of January 22, 1985, Jim Spencer wrote, \"Furthermore, coloured briefs are 'sleazy' and going without underwear ('going commando', as they say on campus) is simply gross.\" The term gained currency in the popular vernacular after appearing in a 1996 episode of Friends.[10][11]\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11254: Going commando. The origins of the phrase \"go commando\" are uncertain, with some speculating that it may refer to being \"out in the open\" or \"ready for action\".[5]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\ndoc11249: Politics of the United States. The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\ndoc11250: Politics of the United States. I fear that we may be on the verge of becoming an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control not just the economy, but the political life of this country. And that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have wrestle with.\n\ndoc543898: Trousers. North Americans call undergarments underwear, underpants, undies, jockey shorts, shorts, long johns or panties (the last are women's garments specifically) to distinguish them from other pants that are worn on the outside. The term drawers normally refers to undergarments, but in some dialects, may be found as a synonym for \"breeches\", that is, trousers. In these dialects, the term underdrawers is used for undergarments. Many North Americans refer to their undergarments by their type, such as boxers or briefs.\n\ndoc2050172: Long underwear. Long underwear, also called long johns or thermal underwear, is a style of two-piece underwear with long legs and long sleeves that is normally worn during cold weather. It is commonly worn by people under their clothes in cold countries.\n\ndoc1426156: Garter (stockings). Since the early 1960s, many men's  magazines featured images of women in underwear, with models in suspenders and stocking, often with slips, petticoats, corsets or a bra and knickers or panties in erotic pose.\nThese images may have an erotic element and are sometimes presented as fetish fashion and also in pornography.\n\ndoc1716803: Women's history. The social aspects of clothing have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different gender roles. In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area or another of the body for attention. In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behavior. For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude. Women's clothing in Victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration. Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauties (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie). Although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's trousers (suitably altered) for outdoor work a hundred years earlier. In the 1960s, Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants. Corsets have long been used for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction. There were, and are, many different styles and types of corsets, varying depending on the intended use, corset maker's style, and the fashions of the era.\n\ndoc2050178: Long underwear. Long johns were first introduced into England in the 17th century, but they did not become popular as sleepwear until the 18th century. They were supposedly called long johns after a famous knife fighter who fought in long underwear. They were first used as loungewear but then later became popular as sleepwear. Children also wore long johns as sleepwear, usually made out of cotton and polyester.\n\ndoc1564100: British slang. Slang is also used to create an identity or sense of belonging and a number of occupations have their own slang; most notably the armed forces, referred to as Forces or Service slang; and the construction industry.[5][15] A dictionary of service slang by J. L. Hunt and A. G. Pringle was published in 1943.[16] It was reprinted in 2008. The introduction acknowledges that slang is an ever-changing language with new slang terms emerging all the time. It also recognises that some service slang has made its way into civilian use.[17][18][19] Examples of this include the old naval terms, \"Talking bilge\" (nonsense) and \"A loose cannon\" (an unorthodox person with the potential to cause harm).[20]\n\ndoc543913: Trousers. During the French Revolution, male citizens of France adopted a working-class costume including ankle-length trousers, or pantaloons (from a Commedia dell'Arte character named Pantalone)[33] in place of the aristocratic knee-breeches. The new garment of the revolutionaries differed from that of the ancien regime upper classes in three ways: it was loose where the style for breeches had most recently been form-fitting, it was ankle length where breeches had generally been knee-length for more than two centuries, and they were open at the bottom while breeches were fastened. Pantaloons became fashionable in early 19th-century England and the Regency era. The style was introduced by Beau Brummell[34][35][36] and by mid-century had supplanted breeches as fashionable street wear.[37] At this point, even knee-length pants adopted the open bottoms of trousers (see shorts) and were worn by young boys, for sports, and in tropical climates. Breeches proper survived into the 20th century as court dress, and also in baggy mid-calf (or three-quarter length) versions known as plus-fours or knickers worn for active sports and by young schoolboys. Types of breeches are still worn today by baseball and American football players.\n\ndoc2619429: Modesty. Since the 1980s it has become more common for young and/or fashionable women in Western societies to wear clothing that bared the midriff, \"short shorts,\" backless tops, sheer and other styles considered to be immodest.[12]\n\ndoc182132: Shorts. In the 1890s, knee pants (an early type of short pants) became the standard wear for American boys. Many urban school portraits from the 1890s show all but the oldest boys wearing knee pants.[4] North American boys normally wore knee pants with short stockings.[5] This began to change after the 1900s when North American boys began wearing knickerbockers, while short pants became more popular in Europe. In the 1930s, shorts started to be worn for casual comfort (e.g. outdoor and athletic activities) by both men and women. However, it was still taboo to wear shorts outside certain activities.\n\ndoc265836: Sagging (fashion). During the first decade of the 21st century, many North American local governments, school systems, transit agencies, and even airlines passed laws and regulations against the practice of wearing sagging pants, although no state or federal laws have been enacted banning the practice.[11] US presidential candidate Barack Obama, speaking just before the 2008 US Presidential Election, appeared on MTV and said that laws banning the practice of wearing low-slung pants that expose one's underwear were \"a waste of time ... Having said that, brothers should pull up their pants. You are walking by your mother, your grandmother, your underwear is showing. What's wrong with that? Come on. Some people might not want to see your underwear. I'm one of them.\"[12]\n\n"

The term appeared in the 1982 novel Groundrush by Greg Barron, in the sentence, \"Bigfoot's jock snapped underneath, leaving him to 'go commando'.\"[9] In the Chicago Tribune of January 22, 1985, Jim Spencer wrote, \"Furthermore, coloured briefs are 'sleazy' and going without underwear ('going commando', as they say on campus) is simply gross.\" The term gained currency in the popular vernacular after appearing in a 1996 episode of Friends.[10][11]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc2546828: Go-go dancing. The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops.

The origins of the phrase \"go commando\" are uncertain, with some speculating that it may refer to being \"out in the open\" or \"ready for action\".[5]\n\ndoc11256: Going commando. The term appeared in the 1982 novel Groundrush by Greg Barron, in the sentence, \"Bigfoot's jock snapped underneath, leaving him to 'go commando'.\"[9] In the Chicago Tribune of January 22, 1985, Jim Spencer wrote, \"Furthermore, coloured briefs are 'sleazy' and going without underwear ('going commando', as they say on campus) is simply gross.\" The term gained currency in the popular vernacular after appearing in a 1996 episode of Friends.[10][11]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc2546828: Go-go dancing. The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops. A synonym used in Vietnam for go-go dancers is \"table dancer\".\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\n",

Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc11254: Going commando. The origins of the phrase \"go commando\" are uncertain, with some speculating that it may refer to being \"out in the open\" or \"ready for action\".[5]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\ndoc11250: Politics of the United States. I fear that we may be on the verge of becoming an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control not just the economy, but the political life of this country. And that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have wrestle with.\n\ndoc11249: Politics of the United States. The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc182129: Shorts. In British English the term \"short trousers\" has been used, but only for shorts that are a short version of real[clarification needed] trousers (pants), e.g. tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of school uniform for boys up to their early teens,[1][2][3] and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. The American term \"short pants\" is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, there they might now be called \"dress shorts\", a term that has not gained much currency in Britain. A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called \"stubbies\". \"Shorts\" is used unqualified in British English to refer to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts: the last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts. Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\n"

The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers.

Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\ndoc11250: Politics of the United States. I fear that we may be on the verge of becoming an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control not just the economy, but the political life of this country. And that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have wrestle with.\n\ndoc11249: Politics of the United States. The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc182129: Shorts. In British English the term \"short trousers\" has been used, but only for shorts that are a short version of real[clarification needed] trousers (pants), e.g. tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of school uniform for boys up to their early teens,[1][2][3] and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. The American term \"short pants\" is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, there they might now be called \"dress shorts\", a term that has not gained much currency in Britain. A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called \"stubbies\". \"Shorts\" is used unqualified in British English to refer to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts: the last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts. Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\n"

The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan.

In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\ndoc11250: Politics of the United States. I fear that we may be on the verge of becoming an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control not just the economy, but the political life of this country. And that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have wrestle with.\n\ndoc11249: Politics of the United States. The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc182129: Shorts. In British English the term \"short trousers\" has been used, but only for shorts that are a short version of real[clarification needed] trousers (pants), e.g. tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of school uniform for boys up to their early teens,[1][2][3] and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. The American term \"short pants\" is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, there they might now be called \"dress shorts\", a term that has not gained much currency in Britain. A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called \"stubbies\". \"Shorts\" is used unqualified in British English to refer to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts: the last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts. Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\n",

It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops. A synonym used in Vietnam for go-go dancers is \"table dancer\".\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\n",

The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc182129: Shorts. In British English the term \"short trousers\" has been used, but only for shorts that are a short version of real[clarification needed] trousers (pants), e.g. tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of school uniform for boys up to their early teens,[1][2][3] and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. The American term \"short pants\" is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, there they might now be called \"dress shorts\", a term that has not gained much currency in Britain. A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called \"stubbies\". \"Shorts\" is used unqualified in British English to refer to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts: the last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts. Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\n",

The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops.

The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc182129: Shorts. In British English the term \"short trousers\" has been used, but only for shorts that are a short version of real[clarification needed] trousers (pants), e.g. tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of school uniform for boys up to their early teens,[1][2][3] and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. The American term \"short pants\" is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, there they might now be called \"dress shorts\", a term that has not gained much currency in Britain. A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called \"stubbies\". \"Shorts\" is used unqualified in British English to refer to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts: the last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts. Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\n",

Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\ndoc11249: Politics of the United States. The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\ndoc11250: Politics of the United States. I fear that we may be on the verge of becoming an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control not just the economy, but the political life of this country. And that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have wrestle with.\n\ndoc543898: Trousers. North Americans call undergarments underwear, underpants, undies, jockey shorts, shorts, long johns or panties (the last are women's garments specifically) to distinguish them from other pants that are worn on the outside. The term drawers normally refers to undergarments, but in some dialects, may be found as a synonym for \"breeches\", that is, trousers. In these dialects, the term underdrawers is used for undergarments. Many North Americans refer to their undergarments by their type, such as boxers or briefs.\n\ndoc2050172: Long underwear. Long underwear, also called long johns or thermal underwear, is a style of two-piece underwear with long legs and long sleeves that is normally worn during cold weather. It is commonly worn by people under their clothes in cold countries.\n\ndoc1426156: Garter (stockings). Since the early 1960s, many men's  magazines featured images of women in underwear, with models in suspenders and stocking, often with slips, petticoats, corsets or a bra and knickers or panties in erotic pose.\nThese images may have an erotic element and are sometimes presented as fetish fashion and also in pornography.\n\ndoc1716803: Women's history. The social aspects of clothing have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different gender roles. In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area or another of the body for attention. In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behavior. For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude. Women's clothing in Victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration. Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauties (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie). Although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's trousers (suitably altered) for outdoor work a hundred years earlier. In the 1960s, Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants. Corsets have long been used for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction. There were, and are, many different styles and types of corsets, varying depending on the intended use, corset maker's style, and the fashions of the era.\n\ndoc2050178: Long underwear. Long johns were first introduced into England in the 17th century, but they did not become popular as sleepwear until the 18th century. They were supposedly called long johns after a famous knife fighter who fought in long underwear. They were first used as loungewear but then later became popular as sleepwear. Children also wore long johns as sleepwear, usually made out of cotton and polyester.\n\ndoc1564100: British slang. Slang is also used to create an identity or sense of belonging and a number of occupations have their own slang; most notably the armed forces, referred to as Forces or Service slang; and the construction industry.[5][15] A dictionary of service slang by J. L. Hunt and A. G. Pringle was published in 1943.[16] It was reprinted in 2008. The introduction acknowledges that slang is an ever-changing language with new slang terms emerging all the time. It also recognises that some service slang has made its way into civilian use.[17][18][19] Examples of this include the old naval terms, \"Talking bilge\" (nonsense) and \"A loose cannon\" (an unorthodox person with the potential to cause harm).[20]\n\ndoc543913: Trousers. During the French Revolution, male citizens of France adopted a working-class costume including ankle-length trousers, or pantaloons (from a Commedia dell'Arte character named Pantalone)[33] in place of the aristocratic knee-breeches. The new garment of the revolutionaries differed from that of the ancien regime upper classes in three ways: it was loose where the style for breeches had most recently been form-fitting, it was ankle length where breeches had generally been knee-length for more than two centuries, and they were open at the bottom while breeches were fastened. Pantaloons became fashionable in early 19th-century England and the Regency era. The style was introduced by Beau Brummell[34][35][36] and by mid-century had supplanted breeches as fashionable street wear.[37] At this point, even knee-length pants adopted the open bottoms of trousers (see shorts) and were worn by young boys, for sports, and in tropical climates. Breeches proper survived into the 20th century as court dress, and also in baggy mid-calf (or three-quarter length) versions known as plus-fours or knickers worn for active sports and by young schoolboys. Types of breeches are still worn today by baseball and American football players.\n\ndoc2619429: Modesty. Since the 1980s it has become more common for young and/or fashionable women in Western societies to wear clothing that bared the midriff, \"short shorts,\" backless tops, sheer and other styles considered to be immodest.[12]\n\ndoc182132: Shorts. In the 1890s, knee pants (an early type of short pants) became the standard wear for American boys. Many urban school portraits from the 1890s show all but the oldest boys wearing knee pants.[4] North American boys normally wore knee pants with short stockings.[5] This began to change after the 1900s when North American boys began wearing knickerbockers, while short pants became more popular in Europe. In the 1930s, shorts started to be worn for casual comfort (e.g. outdoor and athletic activities) by both men and women. However, it was still taboo to wear shorts outside certain activities.\n\ndoc265836: Sagging (fashion). During the first decade of the 21st century, many North American local governments, school systems, transit agencies, and even airlines passed laws and regulations against the practice of wearing sagging pants, although no state or federal laws have been enacted banning the practice.[11] US presidential candidate Barack Obama, speaking just before the 2008 US Presidential Election, appeared on MTV and said that laws banning the practice of wearing low-slung pants that expose one's underwear were \"a waste of time ... Having said that, brothers should pull up their pants. You are walking by your mother, your grandmother, your underwear is showing. What's wrong with that? Come on. Some people might not want to see your underwear. I'm one of them.\"[12]\n\n"

Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc2546828: Go-go dancing. The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops. A synonym used in Vietnam for go-go dancers is \"table dancer\".\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\n",

The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\ndoc182146: Shorts. The traditional grey flannel shorts associated with British school uniform had become well-established by the 1920s, when they were knee-length or just above knee-length.[60][61] Up until the 1950s school shorts were also described as 'knickers' in tailoring catalogues and jargon.[62] This term possibly originated as an abbreviation of knickerbockers, which began being worn by schoolboys for sports in the 1880s.[63] As the term 'knickers' had become synonymous with panties in the 20th century, it was rarely used colloquially for shorts. By 2004, a study of British private schools noted that traditional grey school shorts had become denoters of private or public school uniform, as they were no longer required wear by state schools.[64] Similar tailored shorts form part of school uniform in a number of countries, including Australia, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand,[59] and are also part of the uniform worn by children in organisations such as the Cub Scouts.\n\ndoc1925972: Swim briefs. While swim briefs are used worldwide by athletes for water sports, the popularity of swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom,[2] the roomier and less revealing trunks or board shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent.[3][4] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene.[5] Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, and the ability to be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing \"speedos\" or \"budgie smugglers\".[6]\n\ndoc894797: Clothing laws by country. In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\ndoc182129: Shorts. In British English the term \"short trousers\" has been used, but only for shorts that are a short version of real[clarification needed] trousers (pants), e.g. tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of school uniform for boys up to their early teens,[1][2][3] and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. The American term \"short pants\" is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, there they might now be called \"dress shorts\", a term that has not gained much currency in Britain. A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called \"stubbies\". \"Shorts\" is used unqualified in British English to refer to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts: the last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK.\n\ndoc182141: Shorts. Elastic-waisted soft fabric shorts usually worn as underwear, but originally designed for wear by boxing participants. In their current form \"boxers\" were introduced in 1925 by Jacob Golomb (founder of the sports equipment and clothing company Everlast) as an alternative to the leather-belted trunks that boxers typically wore.[20] They subsequently became an alternative to long underwear as well.[21] Men's boxers as undergarments began to be presented in novelty prints and patterns from the late 1950s onwards.[22] During the 1980s and 1990s women began to wear boxer shorts paired with T-shirts as loungewear or sleepwear.[23] Boxer briefs, which emerged in the 1990s, are an underwear-specific variation on boxer shorts, but made from elastic knit fabric for a snug fit.[24]\n\ndoc182130: Shorts. The term \"boxer shorts\" was an American coinage for a particular kind of men's underwear, and is now common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to as \"boxers\" in the USA. The word \"pants\" refers to outerwear (trousers) in American usage (except when modified to \"underpants\") but when used unqualified in British English generally means underwear.\n\ndoc1564095: British slang. The first recorded uses of slang in Britain occurred in the 16th century in the plays of Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare.[8] The first books containing slang also appeared around that time: Robert Copland's The hye way to the Spytlell hous was a dialogue in verse between Copland and the porter of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which included Thieves' Cant; and in 1566, Thomas Harman's A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds was published. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a short canting dictionary which was later reproduced in other works.[8]\n\ndoc543899: Trousers. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known as \"undies\", or \"y-fronts\".\n\ndoc543945: Trousers. Among certain groups, low-rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \"busting slack.\"[62]\n\ndoc696948: Green beret. Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.[2]\n\n",

And that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have wrestle with.\n\ndoc543898: Trousers. North Americans call undergarments underwear, underpants, undies, jockey shorts, shorts, long johns or panties (the last are women's garments specifically) to distinguish them from other pants that are worn on the outside. The term drawers normally refers to undergarments, but in some dialects, may be found as a synonym for \"breeches\", that is, trousers. In these dialects, the term underdrawers is used for undergarments. Many North Americans refer to their undergarments by their type, such as boxers or briefs.\n\ndoc2050172: Long underwear. Long underwear, also called long johns or thermal underwear, is a style of two-piece underwear with long legs and long sleeves that is normally worn during cold weather. It is commonly worn by people under their clothes in cold countries.\n\ndoc1426156: Garter (stockings). Since the early 1960s, many men's  magazines featured images of women in underwear, with models in suspenders and stocking, often with slips, petticoats, corsets or a bra and knickers or panties in erotic pose.\nThese images may have an erotic element and are sometimes presented as fetish fashion and also in pornography.\n\ndoc1716803: Women's history. The social aspects of clothing have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different gender roles. In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area or another of the body for attention. In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behavior. For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude. Women's clothing in Victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration. Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauties (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie). Although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's trousers (suitably altered) for outdoor work a hundred years earlier. In the 1960s, Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants. Corsets have long been used for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction. There were, and are, many different styles and types of corsets, varying depending on the intended use, corset maker's style, and the fashions of the era.\n\ndoc2050178: Long underwear. Long johns were first introduced into England in the 17th century, but they did not become popular as sleepwear until the 18th century. They were supposedly called long johns after a famous knife fighter who fought in long underwear. They were first used as loungewear but then later became popular as sleepwear. Children also wore long johns as sleepwear, usually made out of cotton and polyester.\n\ndoc1564100: British slang. Slang is also used to create an identity or sense of belonging and a number of occupations have their own slang; most notably the armed forces, referred to as Forces or Service slang; and the construction industry.[5][15] A dictionary of service slang by J. L. Hunt and A. G. Pringle was published in 1943.[16] It was reprinted in 2008. The introduction acknowledges that slang is an ever-changing language with new slang terms emerging all the time. It also recognises that some service slang has made its way into civilian use.[17][18][19] Examples of this include the old naval terms, \"Talking bilge\" (nonsense) and \"A loose cannon\" (an unorthodox person with the potential to cause harm).[20]\n\ndoc543913: Trousers. During the French Revolution, male citizens of France adopted a working-class costume including ankle-length trousers, or pantaloons (from a Commedia dell'Arte character named Pantalone)[33] in place of the aristocratic knee-breeches. The new garment of the revolutionaries differed from that of the ancien regime upper classes in three ways: it was loose where the style for breeches had most recently been form-fitting, it was ankle length where breeches had generally been knee-length for more than two centuries, and they were open at the bottom while breeches were fastened. Pantaloons became fashionable in early 19th-century England and the Regency era. The style was introduced by Beau Brummell[34][35][36] and by mid-century had supplanted breeches as fashionable street wear.[37] At this point, even knee-length pants adopted the open bottoms of trousers (see shorts) and were worn by young boys, for sports, and in tropical climates. Breeches proper survived into the 20th century as court dress, and also in baggy mid-calf (or three-quarter length) versions known as plus-fours or knickers worn for active sports and by young schoolboys. Types of breeches are still worn today by baseball and American football players.\n\ndoc2619429: Modesty. Since the 1980s it has become more common for young and/or fashionable women in Western societies to wear clothing that bared the midriff, \"short shorts,\" backless tops, sheer and other styles considered to be immodest.[12]\n\ndoc182132: Shorts. In the 1890s, knee pants (an early type of short pants) became the standard wear for American boys. Many urban school portraits from the 1890s show all but the oldest boys wearing knee pants.[4] North American boys normally wore knee pants with short stockings.[5] This began to change after the 1900s when North American boys began wearing knickerbockers, while short pants became more popular in Europe. In the 1930s, shorts started to be worn for casual comfort (e.g. outdoor and athletic activities) by both men and women. However, it was still taboo to wear shorts outside certain activities.\n\ndoc265836: Sagging (fashion). During the first decade of the 21st century, many North American local governments, school systems, transit agencies, and even airlines passed laws and regulations against the practice of wearing sagging pants, although no state or federal laws have been enacted banning the practice.[11] US presidential candidate Barack Obama, speaking just before the 2008 US Presidential Election, appeared on MTV and said that laws banning the practice of wearing low-slung pants that expose one's underwear were \"a waste of time ... Having said that, brothers should pull up their pants. You are walking by your mother, your grandmother, your underwear is showing. What's wrong with that? Come on. Some people might not want to see your underwear. I'm one of them.\"[12]\n\n"
