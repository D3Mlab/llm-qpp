Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: what does the application of contract of adhesion mean\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc41332: Standard form contract. The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc1081841: Cell adhesion. The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc1081830: Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules. Examples of these proteins include selectins, integrins, syndecans, and cadherins.[1] Cellular adhesion is essential in maintaining multicellular structure. Cellular adhesion can link cells in different ways and can be involved in signal transduction.[2] Cell adhesion is also essential for the pathogenesis of infectious organisms.\n\ndoc2144597: Adhesive bandage. An adhesive bandage is a small, flexible sheet of material which is sticky on one side, with a smaller, non-sticky, absorbent pad stuck to the sticky side. The pad is placed against the wound, and overlapping edges of the sticky material are smoothed down so they stick to the surrounding skin. Adhesive bandages are generally packaged in a sealed, sterile bag, with a backing covering the sticky side; the backing is removed as the bandage is applied. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes.\n\ndoc1081835: Cell adhesion. Selective cell\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccell adhesion enables vertebrate cells to assemble into organised tissues. Homophilic attachment allows selective recognition, resulting in cells of a similar type sticking together, whereas cells of a different type stay segregated.[3]\n\ndoc85502: Implantation (human embryo). Adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\n\ndoc1752030: Cell junction. Cell adhesion is a vital component of the body. Loss of this adhesion effects cell structure, cellular functioning and communication with other cells and the extracellular matrix and can lead to severe health issues and diseases.\n\n",

However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc258361: Contract. Standard form contracts contain \"boilerplate\", which is a set of \"one size fits all\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and force majeure. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract consumer protection scrutiny.\n\ndoc1749312: Australian contract law. The case law reflect the tension between, on the one hand, the desire to hold parties to their bargains in accordance with the principle pacta sunt servanda and, on the other hand, the courts' reluctance to make a bargain for the parties. Although there have been differences in Australian judicial opinion as to the role of the court in giving effect to a contract,[76] in general the courts give primacy to the need to uphold agreements,[74][77] particularly executed agreements[78] and commercial arrangements.[79]\n\ndoc258373: Contract. Vitiating factors constituting defences to purported contract formation include:\n\ndoc534661: History of contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[29] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[30]\n\ndoc564853: South African contract law. There are diverse consequences for non-compliance with prescribed formalities:\n\ndoc54993: Best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;[4] a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation.[4] Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.[5] According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.\n\ndoc258352: Contract. If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.[45] An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.[46] In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.[47]\n\ndoc258325: Contract. A contract arises when the parties agree that there is an agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each party to a contract must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963. The base of almost all economic relations are made of contracts. Every profession is contract bound. Property, whether owned by businesses or individuals are locked up under contracts.  For example, money in banks and other forms of investment are contractually bound. As a result, contracts constitute modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover a particular contract is not an isolated transaction. Often it is a link in the chain of several contracts. A failure at one place could cause serious dislocation to economic and social life. Contracts, thus must be enforced. But awarding compensation to an injured person is the only way that the law of contract can enforce a contract. However, in many cases compensation fails to serve the economic purpose of a contract. For example, a hospital is interested in the fulfillment of its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier. Thus there was a need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting contractor to actually perform his contract.\n\ndoc140839: English contract law. Generally a contract forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally the agreement is enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as \"consideration\", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent acting on behalf of a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would think they have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, in the context of their bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\n",

Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963. The base of almost all economic relations are made of contracts. Every profession is contract bound. Property, whether owned by businesses or individuals are locked up under contracts.  For example, money in banks and other forms of investment are contractually bound. As a result, contracts constitute modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover a particular contract is not an isolated transaction. Often it is a link in the chain of several contracts. A failure at one place could cause serious dislocation to economic and social life. Contracts, thus must be enforced. But awarding compensation to an injured person is the only way that the law of contract can enforce a contract. However, in many cases compensation fails to serve the economic purpose of a contract. For example, a hospital is interested in the fulfillment of its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier. Thus there was a need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting contractor to actually perform his contract.\n\ndoc1749312: Australian contract law. The case law reflect the tension between, on the one hand, the desire to hold parties to their bargains in accordance with the principle pacta sunt servanda and, on the other hand, the courts' reluctance to make a bargain for the parties.

The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc258361: Contract. Standard form contracts contain \"boilerplate\", which is a set of \"one size fits all\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and force majeure. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract consumer protection scrutiny.\n\ndoc534661: History of contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[29] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[30]\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc258352: Contract. If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.[45] An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.[46] In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.[47]\n\ndoc140839: English contract law. Generally a contract forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally the agreement is enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as \"consideration\", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent acting on behalf of a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would think they have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, in the context of their bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963.

The doctrine came under criticism from many academics and judges, including Lord Scarman, Lord Denning, Lord Reid and Arthur Linton Corbin, and Stephen Guest wrote that \"[I]t is said that it serves only to defeat the legitimate expectations of the third party, that it undermines the social interest of the community in the security of bargains and it is commercially inconvenient\".[14]\n\ndoc140848: English contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[32] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses.[33] Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[34] The courts began by requiring entirely clear information before onerous clauses could be enforced,[35] the Misrepresentation Act 1967 switched the burden of proof onto business to show misleading statements were not negligent, and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 created the jurisdiction to scrap contract terms that were \"unreasonable\", considering the bargaining power of the parties. Collective bargaining by trade unions and a growing number of employment rights carried the employment contract into an autonomous field of labour law where workers had rights, like a minimum wage,[36] fairness in dismissal,[37] the right to join a union and take collective action,[38] and these could not be given up in a contract with an employer. Private housing was subject to basic terms, such as the right to repairs, and restrictions on unfair rent increases, though many protections were abolished during the 1980s.[39] Nevertheless, the scope of the general law of contract had been reduced. It meant that most contracts made by people on an ordinary day were shielded from the power of corporations to impose whatever terms they chose in selling goods and services, at work, and in people's home. Nevertheless, classical contract law remained at the foundation of those specific contracts, unless particular rights were given by the courts or Parliament. Internationally, the UK had joined the European Union, which aimed to harmonise significant parts of consumer and employment law across member states. Moreover, with increasing openness of markets commercial contract law was receiving principles from abroad. Both the Principles of European Contract Law, the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, and the practice of international commercial arbitration was reshaping thinking about English contract principles in an increasingly globalised economy.\n\ndoc564788: South African contract law. A contract has certain characteristic features:\n\ndoc1003482: Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Over the next 200 years, different judges provided different decisions as to whether or not a third party could enforce a contract that benefited them. The dispute ended in 1861 with Tweddle v Atkinson [1861] 121 ER 762, which confirmed that a third party could not enforce a contract that benefited him.[6] This decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge and Co Ltd [1915] AC 847 in 1915,[3] where Lord Haldane stated that only a person who was party to a contract could sue on it.[7] This version of the doctrine is commonly known as the original or basic doctrine.[8][9]\n\ndoc564806: South African contract law. There is mounting competition between them. As Hutchison and Pretorius (2009) note, \u2018The law of contract is currently undergoing a process of quite profound change and renewal as it adapts to meet the demands of the new constitutional era in South Africa\u2019.[24] Freedom of contract especially is under pressure, as the courts are increasingly willing to use public policy as grounds to strike down unfair contracts.[24] The legislature, too, is willing to intervene in private contracts in the interests of fairness,[24] most notably with the National Credit Act[25] and the Consumer Protection Act.[26] The latter prohibits certain terms or conditions outright, with the result that they are void to the extent of non-compliance. Where terms are not prohibited outright, they are subject to a requirement of fairness and reasonableness.\n\ndoc565079: South African contract law. The facts and circumstances of each case are determinative.\n\ndoc1153935: United States contract law. The elements of this cause of action are:\n\ndoc1153937: United States contract law. The elements of this cause of action are:\n\ndoc258369: Contract. The common law doctrine of privity of contract provides that only those who are party to a contract may sue or be sued on it.[68][69] The leading case of Tweddle v Atkinson [1861] [70] immediately showed that the doctrine had the effect of defying the intent of the parties. In maritime law, the cases of Scruttons v Midland Silicones [1962] [71] and N.Z. Shipping v Satterthwaite [1975],[72] established how third parties could gain the protection of limitation clauses within a bill of lading. A number of common law exceptions[73] allowed some circumvention,[74] but the unpopular[75] doctrine remained intact until it was amended by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 which provides:[76]\n\ndoc564805: South African contract law.

The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc1081841: Cell adhesion. The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc1081830: Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules. Examples of these proteins include selectins, integrins, syndecans, and cadherins.[1] Cellular adhesion is essential in maintaining multicellular structure. Cellular adhesion can link cells in different ways and can be involved in signal transduction.[2] Cell adhesion is also essential for the pathogenesis of infectious organisms.\n\ndoc2144597: Adhesive bandage. An adhesive bandage is a small, flexible sheet of material which is sticky on one side, with a smaller, non-sticky, absorbent pad stuck to the sticky side. The pad is placed against the wound, and overlapping edges of the sticky material are smoothed down so they stick to the surrounding skin. Adhesive bandages are generally packaged in a sealed, sterile bag, with a backing covering the sticky side; the backing is removed as the bandage is applied. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes.\n\ndoc1081835: Cell adhesion. Selective cell\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccell adhesion enables vertebrate cells to assemble into organised tissues. Homophilic attachment allows selective recognition, resulting in cells of a similar type sticking together, whereas cells of a different type stay segregated.[3]\n\ndoc85502: Implantation (human embryo). Adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\n\ndoc1752030: Cell junction. Cell adhesion is a vital component of the body. Loss of this adhesion effects cell structure, cellular functioning and communication with other cells and the extracellular matrix and can lead to severe health issues and diseases.\n\n"

Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: what does the application of contract of adhesion mean\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc41332: Standard form contract. The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc1081841: Cell adhesion. The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc1081830: Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules. Examples of these proteins include selectins, integrins, syndecans, and cadherins.[1] Cellular adhesion is essential in maintaining multicellular structure. Cellular adhesion can link cells in different ways and can be involved in signal transduction.[2] Cell adhesion is also essential for the pathogenesis of infectious organisms.\n\ndoc2144597: Adhesive bandage. An adhesive bandage is a small, flexible sheet of material which is sticky on one side, with a smaller, non-sticky, absorbent pad stuck to the sticky side. The pad is placed against the wound, and overlapping edges of the sticky material are smoothed down so they stick to the surrounding skin. Adhesive bandages are generally packaged in a sealed, sterile bag, with a backing covering the sticky side; the backing is removed as the bandage is applied. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes.\n\ndoc1081835: Cell adhesion. Selective cell\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccell adhesion enables vertebrate cells to assemble into organised tissues. Homophilic attachment allows selective recognition, resulting in cells of a similar type sticking together, whereas cells of a different type stay segregated.[3]\n\ndoc85502: Implantation (human embryo). Adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\n\ndoc1752030: Cell junction. Cell adhesion is a vital component of the body. Loss of this adhesion effects cell structure, cellular functioning and communication with other cells and the extracellular matrix and can lead to severe health issues and diseases.\n\n"

Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: what does the application of contract of adhesion mean\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc41332: Standard form contract. The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc1081841: Cell adhesion. The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc1081830: Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules. Examples of these proteins include selectins, integrins, syndecans, and cadherins.[1] Cellular adhesion is essential in maintaining multicellular structure. Cellular adhesion can link cells in different ways and can be involved in signal transduction.[2] Cell adhesion is also essential for the pathogenesis of infectious organisms.\n\ndoc2144597: Adhesive bandage. An adhesive bandage is a small, flexible sheet of material which is sticky on one side, with a smaller, non-sticky, absorbent pad stuck to the sticky side. The pad is placed against the wound, and overlapping edges of the sticky material are smoothed down so they stick to the surrounding skin. Adhesive bandages are generally packaged in a sealed, sterile bag, with a backing covering the sticky side; the backing is removed as the bandage is applied. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes.\n\ndoc1081835: Cell adhesion. Selective cell\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccell adhesion enables vertebrate cells to assemble into organised tissues. Homophilic attachment allows selective recognition, resulting in cells of a similar type sticking together, whereas cells of a different type stay segregated.[3]\n\ndoc85502: Implantation (human embryo). Adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\n\ndoc1752030: Cell junction. Cell adhesion is a vital component of the body. Loss of this adhesion effects cell structure, cellular functioning and communication with other cells and the extracellular matrix and can lead to severe health issues and diseases.\n\n",

The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc85502: Implantation (human embryo). Adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\n\ndoc1081830: Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules. Examples of these proteins include selectins, integrins, syndecans, and cadherins.[1] Cellular adhesion is essential in maintaining multicellular structure. Cellular adhesion can link cells in different ways and can be involved in signal transduction.[2] Cell adhesion is also essential for the pathogenesis of infectious organisms.\n\ndoc1081835: Cell adhesion. Selective cell\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccell adhesion enables vertebrate cells to assemble into organised tissues. Homophilic attachment allows selective recognition, resulting in cells of a similar type sticking together, whereas cells of a different type stay segregated.[3]\n\ndoc1081841: Cell adhesion. The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc1752030: Cell junction. Cell adhesion is a vital component of the body. Loss of this adhesion effects cell structure, cellular functioning and communication with other cells and the extracellular matrix and can lead to severe health issues and diseases.\n\ndoc2144597: Adhesive bandage. An adhesive bandage is a small, flexible sheet of material which is sticky on one side, with a smaller, non-sticky, absorbent pad stuck to the sticky side. The pad is placed against the wound, and overlapping edges of the sticky material are smoothed down so they stick to the surrounding skin. Adhesive bandages are generally packaged in a sealed, sterile bag, with a backing covering the sticky side; the backing is removed as the bandage is applied. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes.\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc258361: Contract. Standard form contracts contain \"boilerplate\", which is a set of \"one size fits all\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and force majeure. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract consumer protection scrutiny.\n\ndoc1749312: Australian contract law. The case law reflect the tension between, on the one hand, the desire to hold parties to their bargains in accordance with the principle pacta sunt servanda and, on the other hand, the courts' reluctance to make a bargain for the parties. Although there have been differences in Australian judicial opinion as to the role of the court in giving effect to a contract,[76] in general the courts give primacy to the need to uphold agreements,[74][77] particularly executed agreements[78] and commercial arrangements.[79]\n\ndoc258373: Contract. Vitiating factors constituting defences to purported contract formation include:\n\ndoc534661: History of contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[29] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[30]\n\ndoc564853: South African contract law. There are diverse consequences for non-compliance with prescribed formalities:\n\ndoc54993: Best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;[4] a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation.[4] Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.[5] According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.\n\ndoc258352: Contract. If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.[45] An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.[46] In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.[47]\n\ndoc258325: Contract. A contract arises when the parties agree that there is an agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each party to a contract must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963. The base of almost all economic relations are made of contracts. Every profession is contract bound. Property, whether owned by businesses or individuals are locked up under contracts.  For example, money in banks and other forms of investment are contractually bound. As a result, contracts constitute modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover a particular contract is not an isolated transaction. Often it is a link in the chain of several contracts. A failure at one place could cause serious dislocation to economic and social life. Contracts, thus must be enforced. But awarding compensation to an injured person is the only way that the law of contract can enforce a contract. However, in many cases compensation fails to serve the economic purpose of a contract. For example, a hospital is interested in the fulfillment of its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier. Thus there was a need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting contractor to actually perform his contract.\n\ndoc140839: English contract law. Generally a contract forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally the agreement is enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as \"consideration\", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent acting on behalf of a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would think they have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, in the context of their bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\n"

Cellular adhesion can link cells in different ways and can be involved in signal transduction.[2] Cell adhesion is also essential for the pathogenesis of infectious organisms.\n\ndoc1081835: Cell adhesion. Selective cell\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccell adhesion enables vertebrate cells to assemble into organised tissues. Homophilic attachment allows selective recognition, resulting in cells of a similar type sticking together, whereas cells of a different type stay segregated.[3]\n\ndoc1081841: Cell adhesion. The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc1752030: Cell junction. Cell adhesion is a vital component of the body. Loss of this adhesion effects cell structure, cellular functioning and communication with other cells and the extracellular matrix and can lead to severe health issues and diseases.\n\ndoc2144597: Adhesive bandage. An adhesive bandage is a small, flexible sheet of material which is sticky on one side, with a smaller, non-sticky, absorbent pad stuck to the sticky side. The pad is placed against the wound, and overlapping edges of the sticky material are smoothed down so they stick to the surrounding skin. Adhesive bandages are generally packaged in a sealed, sterile bag, with a backing covering the sticky side; the backing is removed as the bandage is applied. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes.\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc258361: Contract. Standard form contracts contain \"boilerplate\", which is a set of \"one size fits all\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and force majeure. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract consumer protection scrutiny.\n\ndoc1749312: Australian contract law. The case law reflect the tension between, on the one hand, the desire to hold parties to their bargains in accordance with the principle pacta sunt servanda and, on the other hand, the courts' reluctance to make a bargain for the parties. Although there have been differences in Australian judicial opinion as to the role of the court in giving effect to a contract,[76] in general the courts give primacy to the need to uphold agreements,[74][77] particularly executed agreements[78] and commercial arrangements.[79]\n\ndoc258373: Contract. Vitiating factors constituting defences to purported contract formation include:\n\ndoc534661: History of contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[29] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[30]\n\ndoc564853: South African contract law. There are diverse consequences for non-compliance with prescribed formalities:\n\ndoc54993: Best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;[4] a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation.[4] Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.[5] According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.\n\ndoc258352: Contract. If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.[45] An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.[46] In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.[47]\n\ndoc258325: Contract. A contract arises when the parties agree that there is an agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each party to a contract must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963. The base of almost all economic relations are made of contracts. Every profession is contract bound. Property, whether owned by businesses or individuals are locked up under contracts.  For example, money in banks and other forms of investment are contractually bound. As a result, contracts constitute modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover a particular contract is not an isolated transaction. Often it is a link in the chain of several contracts. A failure at one place could cause serious dislocation to economic and social life. Contracts, thus must be enforced. But awarding compensation to an injured person is the only way that the law of contract can enforce a contract. However, in many cases compensation fails to serve the economic purpose of a contract. For example, a hospital is interested in the fulfillment of its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier. Thus there was a need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting contractor to actually perform his contract.\n\ndoc140839: English contract law. Generally a contract forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally the agreement is enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as \"consideration\", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent acting on behalf of a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would think they have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, in the context of their bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\n"

The pad is placed against the wound, and overlapping edges of the sticky material are smoothed down so they stick to the surrounding skin. Adhesive bandages are generally packaged in a sealed, sterile bag, with a backing covering the sticky side; the backing is removed as the bandage is applied. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes.\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc258361: Contract. Standard form contracts contain \"boilerplate\", which is a set of \"one size fits all\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and force majeure. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract consumer protection scrutiny.\n\ndoc1749312: Australian contract law. The case law reflect the tension between, on the one hand, the desire to hold parties to their bargains in accordance with the principle pacta sunt servanda and, on the other hand, the courts' reluctance to make a bargain for the parties. Although there have been differences in Australian judicial opinion as to the role of the court in giving effect to a contract,[76] in general the courts give primacy to the need to uphold agreements,[74][77] particularly executed agreements[78] and commercial arrangements.[79]\n\ndoc258373: Contract. Vitiating factors constituting defences to purported contract formation include:\n\ndoc534661: History of contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[29] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[30]\n\ndoc564853: South African contract law. There are diverse consequences for non-compliance with prescribed formalities:\n\ndoc54993: Best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;[4] a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation.[4] Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.[5] According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.\n\ndoc258352: Contract. If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.[45] An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.[46] In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.[47]\n\ndoc258325: Contract. A contract arises when the parties agree that there is an agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each party to a contract must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963. The base of almost all economic relations are made of contracts. Every profession is contract bound. Property, whether owned by businesses or individuals are locked up under contracts.  For example, money in banks and other forms of investment are contractually bound. As a result, contracts constitute modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover a particular contract is not an isolated transaction. Often it is a link in the chain of several contracts. A failure at one place could cause serious dislocation to economic and social life. Contracts, thus must be enforced. But awarding compensation to an injured person is the only way that the law of contract can enforce a contract. However, in many cases compensation fails to serve the economic purpose of a contract. For example, a hospital is interested in the fulfillment of its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier. Thus there was a need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting contractor to actually perform his contract.\n\ndoc140839: English contract law. Generally a contract forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally the agreement is enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as \"consideration\", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent acting on behalf of a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would think they have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, in the context of their bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\n",

The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc1081841: Cell adhesion. The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc1081830: Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules. Examples of these proteins include selectins, integrins, syndecans, and cadherins.[1] Cellular adhesion is essential in maintaining multicellular structure.

The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v.

Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc85502: Implantation (human embryo). Adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\n\ndoc1081830: Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules. Examples of these proteins include selectins, integrins, syndecans, and cadherins.[1] Cellular adhesion is essential in maintaining multicellular structure. Cellular adhesion can link cells in different ways and can be involved in signal transduction.[2] Cell adhesion is also essential for the pathogenesis of infectious organisms.\n\ndoc1081835: Cell adhesion.

The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc1752030: Cell junction.

When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\n***\n\nOutput only your reformulated query:",

However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and force majeure. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract consumer protection scrutiny.\n\ndoc1749312: Australian contract law. The case law reflect the tension between, on the one hand, the desire to hold parties to their bargains in accordance with the principle pacta sunt servanda and, on the other hand, the courts' reluctance to make a bargain for the parties. Although there have been differences in Australian judicial opinion as to the role of the court in giving effect to a contract,[76] in general the courts give primacy to the need to uphold agreements,[74][77] particularly executed agreements[78] and commercial arrangements.[79]\n\ndoc258373: Contract. Vitiating factors constituting defences to purported contract formation include:\n\ndoc534661: History of contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[29] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[30]\n\ndoc564853: South African contract law. There are diverse consequences for non-compliance with prescribed formalities:\n\ndoc54993: Best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;[4] a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation.[4] Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.[5] According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.\n\ndoc258352: Contract. If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.[45] An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.[46] In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.[47]\n\ndoc258325: Contract. A contract arises when the parties agree that there is an agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each party to a contract must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963. The base of almost all economic relations are made of contracts. Every profession is contract bound. Property, whether owned by businesses or individuals are locked up under contracts.  For example, money in banks and other forms of investment are contractually bound. As a result, contracts constitute modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover a particular contract is not an isolated transaction. Often it is a link in the chain of several contracts. A failure at one place could cause serious dislocation to economic and social life. Contracts, thus must be enforced. But awarding compensation to an injured person is the only way that the law of contract can enforce a contract. However, in many cases compensation fails to serve the economic purpose of a contract. For example, a hospital is interested in the fulfillment of its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier. Thus there was a need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting contractor to actually perform his contract.\n\ndoc140839: English contract law. Generally a contract forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally the agreement is enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as \"consideration\", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent acting on behalf of a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would think they have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, in the context of their bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\n",

The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc1081841: Cell adhesion. The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc1081830: Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules. Examples of these proteins include selectins, integrins, syndecans, and cadherins.[1] Cellular adhesion is essential in maintaining multicellular structure. Cellular adhesion can link cells in different ways and can be involved in signal transduction.[2] Cell adhesion is also essential for the pathogenesis of infectious organisms.\n\ndoc2144597: Adhesive bandage. An adhesive bandage is a small, flexible sheet of material which is sticky on one side, with a smaller, non-sticky, absorbent pad stuck to the sticky side. The pad is placed against the wound, and overlapping edges of the sticky material are smoothed down so they stick to the surrounding skin. Adhesive bandages are generally packaged in a sealed, sterile bag, with a backing covering the sticky side; the backing is removed as the bandage is applied. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes.\n\ndoc1081835: Cell adhesion. Selective cell\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccell adhesion enables vertebrate cells to assemble into organised tissues. Homophilic attachment allows selective recognition, resulting in cells of a similar type sticking together, whereas cells of a different type stay segregated.[3]\n\ndoc85502: Implantation (human embryo). Adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\n\ndoc1752030: Cell junction. Cell adhesion is a vital component of the body. Loss of this adhesion effects cell structure, cellular functioning and communication with other cells and the extracellular matrix and can lead to severe health issues and diseases.\n\n",

Standard form contracts contain \"boilerplate\", which is a set of \"one size fits all\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and force majeure. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract consumer protection scrutiny.\n\ndoc1749312: Australian contract law. The case law reflect the tension between, on the one hand, the desire to hold parties to their bargains in accordance with the principle pacta sunt servanda and, on the other hand, the courts' reluctance to make a bargain for the parties. Although there have been differences in Australian judicial opinion as to the role of the court in giving effect to a contract,[76] in general the courts give primacy to the need to uphold agreements,[74][77] particularly executed agreements[78] and commercial arrangements.[79]\n\ndoc258373: Contract. Vitiating factors constituting defences to purported contract formation include:\n\ndoc534661: History of contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[29] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[30]\n\ndoc564853: South African contract law. There are diverse consequences for non-compliance with prescribed formalities:\n\ndoc54993: Best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;[4] a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation.[4] Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.[5] According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.\n\ndoc258352: Contract. If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.[45] An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.[46] In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.[47]\n\ndoc258325: Contract. A contract arises when the parties agree that there is an agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each party to a contract must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963. The base of almost all economic relations are made of contracts. Every profession is contract bound. Property, whether owned by businesses or individuals are locked up under contracts.  For example, money in banks and other forms of investment are contractually bound. As a result, contracts constitute modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover a particular contract is not an isolated transaction. Often it is a link in the chain of several contracts. A failure at one place could cause serious dislocation to economic and social life. Contracts, thus must be enforced. But awarding compensation to an injured person is the only way that the law of contract can enforce a contract. However, in many cases compensation fails to serve the economic purpose of a contract. For example, a hospital is interested in the fulfillment of its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier. Thus there was a need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting contractor to actually perform his contract.\n\ndoc140839: English contract law. Generally a contract forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally the agreement is enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as \"consideration\", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent acting on behalf of a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would think they have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, in the context of their bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\n",

The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc258361: Contract. Standard form contracts contain \"boilerplate\", which is a set of \"one size fits all\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and force majeure. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract consumer protection scrutiny.\n\ndoc534661: History of contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[29] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[30]\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc258352: Contract. If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.[45] An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.[46] In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.[47]\n\ndoc140839: English contract law. Generally a contract forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally the agreement is enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as \"consideration\", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent acting on behalf of a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would think they have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, in the context of their bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963. The base of almost all economic relations are made of contracts. Every profession is contract bound. Property, whether owned by businesses or individuals are locked up under contracts.  For example, money in banks and other forms of investment are contractually bound. As a result, contracts constitute modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover a particular contract is not an isolated transaction. Often it is a link in the chain of several contracts. A failure at one place could cause serious dislocation to economic and social life. Contracts, thus must be enforced. But awarding compensation to an injured person is the only way that the law of contract can enforce a contract. However, in many cases compensation fails to serve the economic purpose of a contract. For example, a hospital is interested in the fulfillment of its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier. Thus there was a need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting contractor to actually perform his contract.\n\ndoc1749312: Australian contract law. The case law reflect the tension between, on the one hand, the desire to hold parties to their bargains in accordance with the principle pacta sunt servanda and, on the other hand, the courts' reluctance to make a bargain for the parties. Although there have been differences in Australian judicial opinion as to the role of the court in giving effect to a contract,[76] in general the courts give primacy to the need to uphold agreements,[74][77] particularly executed agreements[78] and commercial arrangements.[79]\n\ndoc54993: Best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;[4] a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation.[4] Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.[5] According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.\n\ndoc1003485: Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. The doctrine came under criticism from many academics and judges, including Lord Scarman, Lord Denning, Lord Reid and Arthur Linton Corbin, and Stephen Guest wrote that \"[I]t is said that it serves only to defeat the legitimate expectations of the third party, that it undermines the social interest of the community in the security of bargains and it is commercially inconvenient\".[14]\n\ndoc140848: English contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[32] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses.[33] Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[34] The courts began by requiring entirely clear information before onerous clauses could be enforced,[35] the Misrepresentation Act 1967 switched the burden of proof onto business to show misleading statements were not negligent, and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 created the jurisdiction to scrap contract terms that were \"unreasonable\", considering the bargaining power of the parties. Collective bargaining by trade unions and a growing number of employment rights carried the employment contract into an autonomous field of labour law where workers had rights, like a minimum wage,[36] fairness in dismissal,[37] the right to join a union and take collective action,[38] and these could not be given up in a contract with an employer. Private housing was subject to basic terms, such as the right to repairs, and restrictions on unfair rent increases, though many protections were abolished during the 1980s.[39] Nevertheless, the scope of the general law of contract had been reduced. It meant that most contracts made by people on an ordinary day were shielded from the power of corporations to impose whatever terms they chose in selling goods and services, at work, and in people's home. Nevertheless, classical contract law remained at the foundation of those specific contracts, unless particular rights were given by the courts or Parliament. Internationally, the UK had joined the European Union, which aimed to harmonise significant parts of consumer and employment law across member states. Moreover, with increasing openness of markets commercial contract law was receiving principles from abroad. Both the Principles of European Contract Law, the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, and the practice of international commercial arbitration was reshaping thinking about English contract principles in an increasingly globalised economy.\n\ndoc564788: South African contract law. A contract has certain characteristic features:\n\ndoc1003482: Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Over the next 200 years, different judges provided different decisions as to whether or not a third party could enforce a contract that benefited them. The dispute ended in 1861 with Tweddle v Atkinson [1861] 121 ER 762, which confirmed that a third party could not enforce a contract that benefited him.[6] This decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge and Co Ltd [1915] AC 847 in 1915,[3] where Lord Haldane stated that only a person who was party to a contract could sue on it.[7] This version of the doctrine is commonly known as the original or basic doctrine.[8][9]\n\ndoc564806: South African contract law. There is mounting competition between them. As Hutchison and Pretorius (2009) note, \u2018The law of contract is currently undergoing a process of quite profound change and renewal as it adapts to meet the demands of the new constitutional era in South Africa\u2019.[24] Freedom of contract especially is under pressure, as the courts are increasingly willing to use public policy as grounds to strike down unfair contracts.[24] The legislature, too, is willing to intervene in private contracts in the interests of fairness,[24] most notably with the National Credit Act[25] and the Consumer Protection Act.[26] The latter prohibits certain terms or conditions outright, with the result that they are void to the extent of non-compliance. Where terms are not prohibited outright, they are subject to a requirement of fairness and reasonableness.\n\ndoc565079: South African contract law. The facts and circumstances of each case are determinative.\n\ndoc1153935: United States contract law. The elements of this cause of action are:\n\ndoc1153937: United States contract law. The elements of this cause of action are:\n\ndoc258369: Contract. The common law doctrine of privity of contract provides that only those who are party to a contract may sue or be sued on it.[68][69] The leading case of Tweddle v Atkinson [1861] [70] immediately showed that the doctrine had the effect of defying the intent of the parties. In maritime law, the cases of Scruttons v Midland Silicones [1962] [71] and N.Z. Shipping v Satterthwaite [1975],[72] established how third parties could gain the protection of limitation clauses within a bill of lading. A number of common law exceptions[73] allowed some circumvention,[74] but the unpopular[75] doctrine remained intact until it was amended by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 which provides:[76]\n\ndoc564805: South African contract law.

The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the Harvard Law Review published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.[4] It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. See Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).[5]\n\ndoc41333: Standard form contract. For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:\n\ndoc1081841: Cell adhesion. The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc955441: Friction. When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\ndoc41329: Standard form contract. Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.\n\ndoc1081830: Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules.

Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to a surface, substrate or another cell, mediated by interactions between molecules of the cell surface. Cell adhesion occurs from the action of transmembrane glycoproteins, called cell adhesion molecules.

The differential adhesion hypothesis (sometimes called the \"thermodynamic hypothesis\")[5] is a theory of cell adhesion advanced by Malcolm Steinberg in 1964 to explain the mechanism by which heterotypic cells in mixed aggregates sort out into isotypic territories. The DAH postulates that tissues are viscoelastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions. These surface tensions have been determined for a variety of tissues, including embryonic tissues and cell lines. The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position relative to a tissue with a lower surface tension (if these tissues can interact with each other through their adhesion machinery).\n\ndoc1752030: Cell junction.

Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[29] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[30]\n\ndoc564853: South African contract law. There are diverse consequences for non-compliance with prescribed formalities:\n\ndoc54993: Best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;[4] a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation.[4] Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.[5] According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.\n\ndoc258352: Contract. If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.[45] An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.[46] In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.[47]\n\ndoc258325: Contract. A contract arises when the parties agree that there is an agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each party to a contract must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.\n\ndoc1572997: Specific Relief Act 1963. The base of almost all economic relations are made of contracts. Every profession is contract bound. Property, whether owned by businesses or individuals are locked up under contracts.  For example, money in banks and other forms of investment are contractually bound. As a result, contracts constitute modern wealth. They are sacred per se. Moreover a particular contract is not an isolated transaction. Often it is a link in the chain of several contracts. A failure at one place could cause serious dislocation to economic and social life. Contracts, thus must be enforced. But awarding compensation to an injured person is the only way that the law of contract can enforce a contract. However, in many cases compensation fails to serve the economic purpose of a contract. For example, a hospital is interested in the fulfillment of its requirements and not in receiving compensation from a failed supplier. Thus there was a need for a remedy which would compel a defaulting contractor to actually perform his contract.\n\ndoc140839: English contract law. Generally a contract forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally the agreement is enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as \"consideration\", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent acting on behalf of a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person would think they have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, in the context of their bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.\n\n",

The doctrine came under criticism from many academics and judges, including Lord Scarman, Lord Denning, Lord Reid and Arthur Linton Corbin, and Stephen Guest wrote that \"[I]t is said that it serves only to defeat the legitimate expectations of the third party, that it undermines the social interest of the community in the security of bargains and it is commercially inconvenient\".[14]\n\ndoc140848: English contract law. Over the 20th century, legislation and changes in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.[32] First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where \"freedom of contract\" appeared far more on the side of large businesses.[33] Consumer contracts came to be regarded as \"contracts of adhesion\" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given \"take it or leave it\" terms.[34] The courts began by requiring entirely clear information before onerous clauses could be enforced,[35] the Misrepresentation Act 1967 switched the burden of proof onto business to show misleading statements were not negligent, and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 created the jurisdiction to scrap contract terms that were \"unreasonable\", considering the bargaining power of the parties. Collective bargaining by trade unions and a growing number of employment rights carried the employment contract into an autonomous field of labour law where workers had rights, like a minimum wage,[36] fairness in dismissal,[37] the right to join a union and take collective action,[38] and these could not be given up in a contract with an employer. Private housing was subject to basic terms, such as the right to repairs, and restrictions on unfair rent increases, though many protections were abolished during the 1980s.[39] Nevertheless, the scope of the general law of contract had been reduced. It meant that most contracts made by people on an ordinary day were shielded from the power of corporations to impose whatever terms they chose in selling goods and services, at work, and in people's home. Nevertheless, classical contract law remained at the foundation of those specific contracts, unless particular rights were given by the courts or Parliament. Internationally, the UK had joined the European Union, which aimed to harmonise significant parts of consumer and employment law across member states. Moreover, with increasing openness of markets commercial contract law was receiving principles from abroad. Both the Principles of European Contract Law, the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, and the practice of international commercial arbitration was reshaping thinking about English contract principles in an increasingly globalised economy.\n\ndoc564788: South African contract law.

The dispute ended in 1861 with Tweddle v Atkinson [1861] 121 ER 762, which confirmed that a third party could not enforce a contract that benefited him.[6] This decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge and Co Ltd [1915] AC 847 in 1915,[3] where Lord Haldane stated that only a person who was party to a contract could sue on it.[7] This version of the doctrine is commonly known as the original or basic doctrine.[8][9]\n\ndoc564806: South African contract law. There is mounting competition between them. As Hutchison and Pretorius (2009) note, \u2018The law of contract is currently undergoing a process of quite profound change and renewal as it adapts to meet the demands of the new constitutional era in South Africa\u2019.[24] Freedom of contract especially is under pressure, as the courts are increasingly willing to use public policy as grounds to strike down unfair contracts.[24] The legislature, too, is willing to intervene in private contracts in the interests of fairness,[24] most notably with the National Credit Act[25] and the Consumer Protection Act.[26] The latter prohibits certain terms or conditions outright, with the result that they are void to the extent of non-compliance. Where terms are not prohibited outright, they are subject to a requirement of fairness and reasonableness.\n\ndoc565079: South African contract law. The facts and circumstances of each case are determinative.\n\ndoc1153935: United States contract law. The elements of this cause of action are:\n\ndoc1153937: United States contract law. The elements of this cause of action are:\n\ndoc258369: Contract. The common law doctrine of privity of contract provides that only those who are party to a contract may sue or be sued on it.[68][69] The leading case of Tweddle v Atkinson [1861] [70] immediately showed that the doctrine had the effect of defying the intent of the parties. In maritime law, the cases of Scruttons v Midland Silicones [1962] [71] and N.Z. Shipping v Satterthwaite [1975],[72] established how third parties could gain the protection of limitation clauses within a bill of lading. A number of common law exceptions[73] allowed some circumvention,[74] but the unpopular[75] doctrine remained intact until it was amended by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 which provides:[76]\n\ndoc564805: South African contract law.
