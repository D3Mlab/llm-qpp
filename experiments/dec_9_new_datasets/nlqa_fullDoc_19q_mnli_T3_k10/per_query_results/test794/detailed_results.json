In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443788: GNU General Public License. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories. The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.[1]\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\n",

To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events.

In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\ndoc1443788: GNU General Public License. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project.

In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to write a complete operating system free from constraints on use of its source code. Particular incidents that motivated this include a case where an annoying printer couldn't be fixed because the source code was withheld from users.[24] Stallman also published the GNU Manifesto in 1985 to outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of free software. Another probable inspiration for the GNU project and its manifesto was a disagreement between Stallman and Symbolics, Inc. over MIT's access to updates Symbolics had made to its Lisp machine, which was based on MIT code.[25] Soon after the launch, he[17] used[clarification needed] the existing term \"free software\" and founded the Free Software Foundation to promote the concept. The Free Software Definition was published in February 1986.\n\ndoc28244: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software.

The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc681449: History of free and open-source software. The term was given a big boost at an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the \"Freeware Summit\" and later named the \"Open Source Summit\"[37], the event brought together the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski of Netscape, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, the confusion caused by the name free software was brought up. Tiemann argued for \"sourceware\" as a new term, while Raymond argued for \"open source\". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference that evening. Five days later, Raymond made the first public call to the free software community to adopt the new term.[38] The Open Source Initiative was formed shortly thereafter.[35] According to the OSI Richard Stallman initially flirted with the idea of adopting the open source term.[39] But as the enormous success of the open source term buried Stallman's free software term and his message on social values and computer users' freedom,[40][41][42] later Stallman and his FSF strongly objected the OSI's approach and terminology.[43] Due to the rejection of Stallman of the term open-source software, the FOSS ecosystem is being divided in its terminology, see also Alternative terms for free software. For example, a 2002 FOSS developer survey revealed that 32.6% associate themselves with OSS, 48% with free software, and 19.4% in between or undecided.[44] Stallman still maintained, however, that users of each term were allies in the fight against proprietary software.\n\ndoc28248: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Modern free software and Open-source software systems are composed of software by many different authors, including the Linux kernel developers, the GNU project, and other vendors such as those behind the X Window System. Desktop- and server-based distributions use GNU components such as the GNU C Library (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (Coreutils), and bash.\n\ndoc1443786: GNU General Public License. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain.[7][9][10][11][12] Prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community.[13]\n\ndoc2608811: The Free Software Definition. In 1996, when the gnu.org website was launched, \"free software\" was defined referring to \"three levels of freedom\" by adding an explicit mention of the freedom to study the software (which could be read in the two-point definition as being part of the freedom to change the program).[4][5]  Stallman later avoided the word \"levels\", saying that you need all of the freedoms, so it's misleading to think in terms of levels.\n\ndoc1443891: GNU General Public License. In 2005, open source software advocate Eric S. Raymond questioned the relevance of GPL at that point in time for the FOSS ecosystem, stating: \"We don't need the GPL anymore. It's based on the belief that open source software is weak and needs to be protected. Open source would be succeeding faster if the GPL didn't make lots of people nervous about adopting it.\".[169] Richard Stallman replied that: \"GPL is designed to [...] ensure that every user of a program gets the essential freedoms\u2014to run it, to study and change the source code, to redistribute copies, and to publish modified versions\u00a0... [Raymond] addresses the issue in terms of different goals and values\u2014those of \"open source,\" which do not include defending software users' freedom to share and change software.\"[170]\n\ndoc855029: Linux. Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked.[33] As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users weren't legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a \"complete Unix-compatible software system\" composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984.[34] Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.[35]\n\ndoc681467: History of free and open-source software. Microsoft representatives have made regular appearances at various open source and Linux conferences for many years.\n\ndoc1443878: GNU General Public License. In August 2013, according to Black Duck Software, the website's data shows that the GPL license family is used by 54% of open-source projects, with a breakdown of the individual licenses shown in the following table.[117] However, a later study in 2013 showed that software licensed under the GPL license family has increased, and that even the data from Black Duck Software has shown a total increase of software projects licensed under GPL. The study used public information gathered from repositories of the Debian Project, and the study criticized Black Duck Software for not publishing their methodology used in collecting statistics.[134] Daniel German, Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria in Canada, presented a talk in 2013 about the methodological challenges in determining which are the most widely used free software licenses, and showed how he could not replicate the result from Black Duck Software.[135]\n\ndoc681439: History of free and open-source software. Until this point, the GNU project's lack of a kernel meant that no complete free software operating systems existed. The development of Torvalds' kernel closed that last gap. The combination of the almost-finished GNU operating system and the Linux kernel made the first complete free software operating system.\n\ndoc1443828: GNU General Public License. Other licenses created by the GNU project include the GNU Lesser General Public License, the GNU Free Documentation License and Affero General Public License.\n\n"

In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443788: GNU General Public License. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories. The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.[1]\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\n"

In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443788: GNU General Public License. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories. The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.[1]\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\n"

In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443788: GNU General Public License. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories. The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.[1]\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\n",

In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443788: GNU General Public License. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories. The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.[1]\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\n",

We made a list of the programs needed to make a complete free system, and we systematically wrote, or found people to write, everything on the list.\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\ndoc1443788: GNU General Public License. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWho is primarily credited with initiating and leading the GNU Project, what were their key motivations, and what specific contributions did they make to its development and success?

In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443788: GNU General Public License. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events.

The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories. The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.[1]\n\ndoc28266: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In continuing to speak on the subject, in 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project. Because the system is more widely referred as \"Linux\" people tend to \"think it's all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that's the really bad problem.\"[42]\n\ndoc28243: GNU/Linux naming controversy.

It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]\n\n",

The term was given a big boost at an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the \"Freeware Summit\" and later named the \"Open Source Summit\"[37], the event brought together the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski of Netscape, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, the confusion caused by the name free software was brought up. Tiemann argued for \"sourceware\" as a new term, while Raymond argued for \"open source\". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference that evening. Five days later, Raymond made the first public call to the free software community to adopt the new term.[38] The Open Source Initiative was formed shortly thereafter.[35] According to the OSI Richard Stallman initially flirted with the idea of adopting the open source term.[39] But as the enormous success of the open source term buried Stallman's free software term and his message on social values and computer users' freedom,[40][41][42] later Stallman and his FSF strongly objected the OSI's approach and terminology.[43] Due to the rejection of Stallman of the term open-source software, the FOSS ecosystem is being divided in its terminology, see also Alternative terms for free software. For example, a 2002 FOSS developer survey revealed that 32.6% associate themselves with OSS, 48% with free software, and 19.4% in between or undecided.[44] Stallman still maintained, however, that users of each term were allies in the fight against proprietary software.\n\ndoc28248: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Modern free software and Open-source software systems are composed of software by many different authors, including the Linux kernel developers, the GNU project, and other vendors such as those behind the X Window System. Desktop- and server-based distributions use GNU components such as the GNU C Library (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (Coreutils), and bash.\n\ndoc1443786: GNU General Public License. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain.[7][9][10][11][12] Prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community.[13]\n\ndoc2608811: The Free Software Definition. In 1996, when the gnu.org website was launched, \"free software\" was defined referring to \"three levels of freedom\" by adding an explicit mention of the freedom to study the software (which could be read in the two-point definition as being part of the freedom to change the program).[4][5]  Stallman later avoided the word \"levels\", saying that you need all of the freedoms, so it's misleading to think in terms of levels.\n\ndoc1443891: GNU General Public License. In 2005, open source software advocate Eric S. Raymond questioned the relevance of GPL at that point in time for the FOSS ecosystem, stating: \"We don't need the GPL anymore. It's based on the belief that open source software is weak and needs to be protected. Open source would be succeeding faster if the GPL didn't make lots of people nervous about adopting it.\".[169] Richard Stallman replied that: \"GPL is designed to [...] ensure that every user of a program gets the essential freedoms\u2014to run it, to study and change the source code, to redistribute copies, and to publish modified versions\u00a0... [Raymond] addresses the issue in terms of different goals and values\u2014those of \"open source,\" which do not include defending software users' freedom to share and change software.\"[170]\n\ndoc855029: Linux. Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked.[33] As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users weren't legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a \"complete Unix-compatible software system\" composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984.[34] Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.[35]\n\ndoc681467: History of free and open-source software. Microsoft representatives have made regular appearances at various open source and Linux conferences for many years.\n\ndoc1443878: GNU General Public License. In August 2013, according to Black Duck Software, the website's data shows that the GPL license family is used by 54% of open-source projects, with a breakdown of the individual licenses shown in the following table.[117] However, a later study in 2013 showed that software licensed under the GPL license family has increased, and that even the data from Black Duck Software has shown a total increase of software projects licensed under GPL. The study used public information gathered from repositories of the Debian Project, and the study criticized Black Duck Software for not publishing their methodology used in collecting statistics.[134] Daniel German, Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria in Canada, presented a talk in 2013 about the methodological challenges in determining which are the most widely used free software licenses, and showed how he could not replicate the result from Black Duck Software.[135]\n\ndoc681439: History of free and open-source software. Until this point, the GNU project's lack of a kernel meant that no complete free software operating systems existed. The development of Torvalds' kernel closed that last gap. The combination of the almost-finished GNU operating system and the Linux kernel made the first complete free software operating system.\n\ndoc1443828: GNU General Public License.

In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc1443788: GNU General Public License. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989, for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs (1985),[16] the GNU Debugger and the GNU C Compiler.[17] These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.[18] Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1443890: GNU General Public License. In 2000 developer and author Nikolai Bezroukov published an analysis and comprehensive critique of GPL's foundations and Stallman's software development model, called \"Labyrinth of Software Freedom\".[167][168]\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \"information\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project.\n\ndoc2422928: Software categories.

In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to write a complete operating system free from constraints on use of its source code. Particular incidents that motivated this include a case where an annoying printer couldn't be fixed because the source code was withheld from users.[24] Stallman also published the GNU Manifesto in 1985 to outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of free software. Another probable inspiration for the GNU project and its manifesto was a disagreement between Stallman and Symbolics, Inc. over MIT's access to updates Symbolics had made to its Lisp machine, which was based on MIT code.[25] Soon after the launch, he[17] used[clarification needed] the existing term \"free software\" and founded the Free Software Foundation to promote the concept. The Free Software Definition was published in February 1986.\n\ndoc28244: GNU/Linux naming controversy. In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb's Journal detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software.[11][12] Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking. The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable.\n\ndoc22708: History of Linux. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\ndoc771058: Unix. In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the Linux operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\ndoc681429: History of free and open-source software. To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the \u201cfree\u201d status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\n\ndoc1486394: 20th-century events.

The term was given a big boost at an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the \"Freeware Summit\" and later named the \"Open Source Summit\"[37], the event brought together the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski of Netscape, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, the confusion caused by the name free software was brought up. Tiemann argued for \"sourceware\" as a new term, while Raymond argued for \"open source\". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference that evening. Five days later, Raymond made the first public call to the free software community to adopt the new term.[38] The Open Source Initiative was formed shortly thereafter.[35] According to the OSI Richard Stallman initially flirted with the idea of adopting the open source term.[39] But as the enormous success of the open source term buried Stallman's free software term and his message on social values and computer users' freedom,[40][41][42] later Stallman and his FSF strongly objected the OSI's approach and terminology.[43] Due to the rejection of Stallman of the term open-source software, the FOSS ecosystem is being divided in its terminology, see also Alternative terms for free software. For example, a 2002 FOSS developer survey revealed that 32.6% associate themselves with OSS, 48% with free software, and 19.4% in between or undecided.[44] Stallman still maintained, however, that users of each term were allies in the fight against proprietary software.\n\ndoc28248: GNU/Linux naming controversy. Modern free software and Open-source software systems are composed of software by many different authors, including the Linux kernel developers, the GNU project, and other vendors such as those behind the X Window System. Desktop- and server-based distributions use GNU components such as the GNU C Library (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (Coreutils), and bash.\n\ndoc1443786: GNU General Public License. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain.[7][9][10][11][12] Prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community.[13]\n\ndoc2608811: The Free Software Definition. In 1996, when the gnu.org website was launched, \"free software\" was defined referring to \"three levels of freedom\" by adding an explicit mention of the freedom to study the software (which could be read in the two-point definition as being part of the freedom to change the program).[4][5]  Stallman later avoided the word \"levels\", saying that you need all of the freedoms, so it's misleading to think in terms of levels.\n\ndoc1443891: GNU General Public License. In 2005, open source software advocate Eric S. Raymond questioned the relevance of GPL at that point in time for the FOSS ecosystem, stating: \"We don't need the GPL anymore. It's based on the belief that open source software is weak and needs to be protected. Open source would be succeeding faster if the GPL didn't make lots of people nervous about adopting it.\".[169] Richard Stallman replied that: \"GPL is designed to [...] ensure that every user of a program gets the essential freedoms\u2014to run it, to study and change the source code, to redistribute copies, and to publish modified versions\u00a0... [Raymond] addresses the issue in terms of different goals and values\u2014those of \"open source,\" which do not include defending software users' freedom to share and change software.\"[170]\n\ndoc855029: Linux. Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked.[33] As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users weren't legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a \"complete Unix-compatible software system\" composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984.[34] Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.[35]\n\ndoc681467: History of free and open-source software. Microsoft representatives have made regular appearances at various open source and Linux conferences for many years.\n\ndoc1443878: GNU General Public License. In August 2013, according to Black Duck Software, the website's data shows that the GPL license family is used by 54% of open-source projects, with a breakdown of the individual licenses shown in the following table.[117] However, a later study in 2013 showed that software licensed under the GPL license family has increased, and that even the data from Black Duck Software has shown a total increase of software projects licensed under GPL. The study used public information gathered from repositories of the Debian Project, and the study criticized Black Duck Software for not publishing their methodology used in collecting statistics.[134] Daniel German, Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria in Canada, presented a talk in 2013 about the methodological challenges in determining which are the most widely used free software licenses, and showed how he could not replicate the result from Black Duck Software.[135]\n\ndoc681439: History of free and open-source software. Until this point, the GNU project's lack of a kernel meant that no complete free software operating systems existed. The development of Torvalds' kernel closed that last gap. The combination of the almost-finished GNU operating system and the Linux kernel made the first complete free software operating system.\n\ndoc1443828: GNU General Public License.
