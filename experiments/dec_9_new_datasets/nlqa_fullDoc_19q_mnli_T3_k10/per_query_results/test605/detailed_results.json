        "When did Goku first transform into a Super Saiyan 4 in Dragon Ball GT, and what were the specific events and circumstances surrounding this transformation?  I'm interested in the details of his power level increase, any new abilities gained, and the visual differences compared to his previous Super Saiyan forms (e.g., Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, Super Saiyan 3).  Could you also describe the role of the Blutz Wave Generator in this transformation and how it affected Goku's subsequent battles against major antagonists like Baby and Omega Shenron?

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations.

There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n",

Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together!

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21595: Goku. Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc2409398: Vegeta. Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues.[90][91][92] Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS\uff08\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\uff09, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta).\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc834588: Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga and anime.\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains more power, becoming Omega Shenron and overwhelming Goku. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but then Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan 4, thanks to Bulma's new device, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta fuse, using the Fusion Dance technique, creating Gogeta, who uses his immense power to taunt Omega Shenron. However, after being too confident in their ability to defeat Omega Shenron, they use up too much time in an attempt to embarrass Omega Shenron, their fusion then ends and Goku loses his Super Saiyan 4 form along with Vegeta. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku makes a Spirit Bomb powerful enough to destroy Omega Shenron, and end the battle.\n\n",

He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct.

In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains more power, becoming Omega Shenron and overwhelming Goku. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but then Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan 4, thanks to Bulma's new device, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta fuse, using the Fusion Dance technique, creating Gogeta, who uses his immense power to taunt Omega Shenron. However, after being too confident in their ability to defeat Omega Shenron, they use up too much time in an attempt to embarrass Omega Shenron, their fusion then ends and Goku loses his Super Saiyan 4 form along with Vegeta. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku makes a Spirit Bomb powerful enough to destroy Omega Shenron, and end the battle.\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc21596: Goku. Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife.

After a second defeat at the hands of the three Saiyans, Baby infects Trunks and then goes to Earth. On Earth he battles Goten and Gohan, infects them both, and is able to infect Vegeta and make him his primary host. Goku, Trunks, and Pan return to Earth to find the entire population is now under Baby's control. Baby is able to defeat Goku, then he begins using the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats Goku again. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku is able to defeat \"Baby-Vegeta\". He has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a 10x Kamehameha attack, sending it into the sun. The ship is destroyed and Baby is obliterated. He is voiced by Yusuke Numata in Japanese media and by Mike McFarland in the Funimation anime dub.\n\ndoc2341556: Dragon Ball GT. Baby has the ability to invade other people's bodies and turn them into Tuffles, as well as using a body to combine it with his own power and become a fighter. After turning practically all of the Earth's population, including the Saiyans, into Tuffles, Baby decides to remain inside Vegeta's body and use it to confront Goku. Goku fights him and is defeated, but after having his tail regenerated, transforms, achieving the power of Super Saiyan 4 (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin F\u014d), and destroys Baby, propelling him into the sun with a Kamehameha Wave. Piccolo then sacrifices himself to turn the Black Star Dragon Balls into stone permanently when the Earth explodes after Goku and the others helped everyone evacuate to the Tuffle Planet.\n\ndoc1715835: List of Dragon Ball characters. Broly (\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Buror\u012b) is an anime-only character that appears in the eighth, tenth, and eleventh Dragon Ball Z movies as the main villain. He was born with a power greater than most elite adult Saiyans, and is mentally unsettled as an adult, partially due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, partially because of traumatic events during his childhood (including nearly being executed for his power as well as Freeza's genocide) and partially because his power was so extreme. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\" (\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Densetsu no Ch\u014d Saiya-jin) told of in legends, with his destructive tendencies only being quelled by a special controlling device created by scientists for his father, Paragus (\u30d1\u30e9\u30ac\u30b9, Paragasu). In movie eight, after Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Future Trunks as well as Piccolo before killing his father. He is eventually defeated by Goku, but somehow manages to make his way into an escape pod. In movie ten, he lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goku's son Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten by their combined Kamehameha attack after being blasted through the sun. Though in movie eleven, blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone, \"Bio-Broly\" (\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Baio Buror\u012b). The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, transforming him into a bio-mutant of sorts. He is eventually killed by Goten, Trunks, and Kuririn. He is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese films, and Vic Mignogna in the Funimation dub.\n\ndoc21590: Goku. Son Goku (Japanese: \u5b6b \u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Son Gok\u016b) is a fictional character and main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong, a main character in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Goku first made his debut in Dragon Ball chapter #1 Bulma and Son Goku (\u30d6\u30eb\u30de\u3068\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Buruma to Son Gok\u016b), originally published in Japan's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984,[1] as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the wish-granting Dragon Balls.\n\ndoc196098: Bulma. In Dragon Ball GT she becomes possessed by Baby, who takes her as his apparent queen (or second in command), as possessing Vegeta gave him all of his memories and emotions. During this time, she organizes the migration to Planet Vegeta (renamed Planet Tuffle), and creates the Super Bruits Wave Generator (\u8d85\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c4\u6ce2\u767a\u751f\u88c5\u7f6e, Ch\u014d Bur\u016btsuha Hassei S\u014dchi) that helps Baby become the Saiyan's Golden Great Ape transformation. However, the Holy Water hidden in Dende's Lookout is used to free her and the rest of Earth from Baby's enslavement. Later, she helps Vegeta reach Super Saiyan 4 by exposing him to a new Super Bruits Wave Generator, and witnesses Omega Shenron's defeat at the hands of Goku.[35]\n\ndoc2341559: Dragon Ball GT. The real Shenlong appears to grant Goku and his friends one last wish, and then proceeds to disappear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d along with Goku and the Dragon Balls. Several decades later, Goku's great-great-grandson, Goku Jr., participates in the World Tournament against Vegeta Jr., as his grandmother Pan cheers for him. Pan then sees Goku and tries to approach him but Goku disappears into the crowd. Goku then leaves the World Tournament with a flashback of his timeline. After the flashback of his timeline ends, Goku then catches his power pole and rides off on his Flying Nimbus cloud.\n\ndoc227802: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Vegeta soon loses patience with Paragus and decides to return to Earth with the others, but Goku and the others confront Paragus, having realised that Broly is in fact the Legendary Super Saiyan himself. The slaves, upon seeing Broly, also identify him as the one who destroyed their planet, but Broly again becomes fixated on Goku, and his rage erupts so much that he breaks free of the mind control device and transforms into a behemoth of a Super Saiyan: the Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly sets his eyes on Goku and begins fighting him and the others, while Vegeta, frightened of the Legendary Super Saiyan, loses the will to fight. Paragus taunts Vegeta for his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and reveals his true story and intentions: many years ago, on Planet Vegeta, Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, (but Goku was born with a power level of 2), which was an impressive feat for anyone, let alone a baby to achieve. However, King Vegeta feared that the baby would grow up to become a threat to his royal family line and ordered him executed. Paragus barged into the court and begged King Vegeta to spare him, but he refused and severely wounded Paragus. Broly was stabbed in the stomach, and he and Paragus were left for dead. However, that same day, Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, and just before the explosion, Broly manifested his anger to blast him and Paragus away from Planet Vegeta only seconds before demolition. Because of Goku's crying, the attempted execution, and having to survive the Saiyan eradication, Broly grew into a severely unstable child. At one point, he even blinded Paragus in one eye, and Paragus only managed to pacify him via the mind control device. Since then, Paragus' goal has been revenge on King Vegeta through his son, Vegeta, and to take over the Earth as a new Planet Vegeta from which to rule the entire universe. Furthermore, a comet, Camori, is approaching New Vegeta, and will destroy it upon impact.\n\ndoc227801: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. On New Vegeta, Vegeta meets Paragus' son, Broly, and the two leave together to hunt down the Legendary Super Saiyan. Gohan, Trunks and Krillin meet the planet's slaves and defend them from their abusive masters. During the struggle, Goku arrives via Instant Transmission, having followed their energy signals after King Kai's story. The slaves tell them that the Legendary Super Saiyan destroyed their planet, and they were found by Paragus, who made them into his slaves. That night, Vegeta and Broly return, having had no luck. While Vegeta receives Goku coldly, Broly appears agitated at the mere sight of him, and only calms down when Paragus raises his hand and a light shines on his bracelet. Despite this, Broly attacks Goku in the middle of the night. The two fight evenly matched for a while until Paragus appears and calms Broly down again. After the fight Goku suspects that Broly is the Legendary Super Saiyan due to their similar ki and also begins to doubt Paragus' claims. Paragus, for his part, has been controlling Broly with a mind control device, which he suspects may be malfunctioning. Paragus then realises that it is Broly's connection to Goku that has made him angry: Broly and Goku were born on the same day and were in neighbouring pods, and Goku's constant crying agitated Broly so much that it made him resent Goku for many years afterwards, and now, having come face to face with him, old wounds have begun to surface.\n\ndoc83783: Dragon Ball Z. Upon his return to Earth a year later, Goku encounters a time traveler named Trunks, the future son of Bulma and Vegeta, who warns Goku that two Artificial Humans (\u4eba\u9020\u4eba\u9593, Jinz\u014dningen, lit. \"Artificial Humans\") will appear three years later, seeking revenge against Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army when he was a child. During this time, an evil life form called Cell emerges and after absorbing two of the Artificial Humans to achieve his \"perfect form,\" holds his own fighting tournament to decide the fate of the Earth, called the \"Cell Games\". After Goku sacrifices his own life a second time, to no avail, Gohan avenges his father by defeating Cell after ascending to the second level of Super Saiyan. Seven years later Goku, who has been briefly revived for one day and meets his youngest son Goten, and his allies are drawn into a fight by the Kaioshin against a magical being named Majin Buu. After numerous battles resulting in the destruction and recreation of the Earth, Goku (whose life is permanently restored by the Elder Kaioshin) destroys Majin Buu with a Genki Dama attack containing the energy of everyone on Earth. Goku makes a wish for Buu to be reincarnated as a good person and ten years later, at another martial arts tournament, Goku meets Buu's human reincarnation, Uub. Leaving the match between them unfinished, Goku departs with Uub to train him to become Earth's new defender.\n\ndoc2341555: Dragon Ball GT. Five years after the end of the Dragon Ball Z anime (10 years in the Funimation dub),[1] Goku is turned back into a child by the Black Star Dragon Balls (\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb, D\u0101ku Doragon B\u014dru, lit. \"Dark Dragon Balls\") used by Pilaf and is forced to travel across the universe to retrieve them along with his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. The trio go through various adventures in their journey to find the Black Star Dragon Balls, until they encounter the evil artificial Tuffle, Baby, who intends to destroy the Saiyan race.\n\n"

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n"

After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie.

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level.

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie.

An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n",

While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\n***\n\nOutput only your reformulated query:"

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks.

Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors.

Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\n***\n\nOutput only your reformulated query:",

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally.

Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc2409398: Vegeta. Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues.[90][91][92] Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS\uff08\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\uff09, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta).\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc834588: Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga and anime.\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains more power, becoming Omega Shenron and overwhelming Goku. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but then Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan 4, thanks to Bulma's new device, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta fuse, using the Fusion Dance technique, creating Gogeta, who uses his immense power to taunt Omega Shenron. However, after being too confident in their ability to defeat Omega Shenron, they use up too much time in an attempt to embarrass Omega Shenron, their fusion then ends and Goku loses his Super Saiyan 4 form along with Vegeta. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku makes a Spirit Bomb powerful enough to destroy Omega Shenron, and end the battle.\n\n"

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n",

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21595: Goku. Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc2409398: Vegeta. Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues.[90][91][92] Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS\uff08\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\uff09, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta).\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc834588: Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga and anime.\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains more power, becoming Omega Shenron and overwhelming Goku. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but then Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan 4, thanks to Bulma's new device, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta fuse, using the Fusion Dance technique, creating Gogeta, who uses his immense power to taunt Omega Shenron. However, after being too confident in their ability to defeat Omega Shenron, they use up too much time in an attempt to embarrass Omega Shenron, their fusion then ends and Goku loses his Super Saiyan 4 form along with Vegeta. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku makes a Spirit Bomb powerful enough to destroy Omega Shenron, and end the battle.\n\n"

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug.

While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n",

Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21595: Goku. Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc2409398: Vegeta. Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues.[90][91][92] Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS\uff08\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\uff09, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta).\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc834588: Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga and anime.\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains more power, becoming Omega Shenron and overwhelming Goku. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but then Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan 4, thanks to Bulma's new device, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta fuse, using the Fusion Dance technique, creating Gogeta, who uses his immense power to taunt Omega Shenron. However, after being too confident in their ability to defeat Omega Shenron, they use up too much time in an attempt to embarrass Omega Shenron, their fusion then ends and Goku loses his Super Saiyan 4 form along with Vegeta. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku makes a Spirit Bomb powerful enough to destroy Omega Shenron, and end the battle.\n\n",

In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created.

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife.

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n",

He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\n***\n\nOutput only your reformulated query:",

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21595: Goku. Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc2409398: Vegeta. Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues.[90][91][92] Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS\uff08\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\uff09, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta).\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc834588: Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga and anime.\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains more power, becoming Omega Shenron and overwhelming Goku. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but then Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan 4, thanks to Bulma's new device, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta fuse, using the Fusion Dance technique, creating Gogeta, who uses his immense power to taunt Omega Shenron. However, after being too confident in their ability to defeat Omega Shenron, they use up too much time in an attempt to embarrass Omega Shenron, their fusion then ends and Goku loses his Super Saiyan 4 form along with Vegeta. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku makes a Spirit Bomb powerful enough to destroy Omega Shenron, and end the battle.\n\n",

She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\nWhen did Goku first achieve the Super Saiyan 4 transformation in the Dragon Ball GT anime series, and what were the specific circumstances leading up to this transformation, including the events and opponents involved?

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket.

All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n",

Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\n***\n\nOutput only your reformulated query:",

Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc2409398: Vegeta. Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues.[90][91][92] Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS\uff08\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\uff09, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta).\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape.

He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape.

Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc21596: Goku. Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race.

After a second defeat at the hands of the three Saiyans, Baby infects Trunks and then goes to Earth. On Earth he battles Goten and Gohan, infects them both, and is able to infect Vegeta and make him his primary host. Goku, Trunks, and Pan return to Earth to find the entire population is now under Baby's control. Baby is able to defeat Goku, then he begins using the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats Goku again. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku is able to defeat \"Baby-Vegeta\". He has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a 10x Kamehameha attack, sending it into the sun. The ship is destroyed and Baby is obliterated. He is voiced by Yusuke Numata in Japanese media and by Mike McFarland in the Funimation anime dub.\n\ndoc2341556: Dragon Ball GT. Baby has the ability to invade other people's bodies and turn them into Tuffles, as well as using a body to combine it with his own power and become a fighter. After turning practically all of the Earth's population, including the Saiyans, into Tuffles, Baby decides to remain inside Vegeta's body and use it to confront Goku. Goku fights him and is defeated, but after having his tail regenerated, transforms, achieving the power of Super Saiyan 4 (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin F\u014d), and destroys Baby, propelling him into the sun with a Kamehameha Wave. Piccolo then sacrifices himself to turn the Black Star Dragon Balls into stone permanently when the Earth explodes after Goku and the others helped everyone evacuate to the Tuffle Planet.\n\ndoc1715835: List of Dragon Ball characters. Broly (\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Buror\u012b) is an anime-only character that appears in the eighth, tenth, and eleventh Dragon Ball Z movies as the main villain. He was born with a power greater than most elite adult Saiyans, and is mentally unsettled as an adult, partially due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, partially because of traumatic events during his childhood (including nearly being executed for his power as well as Freeza's genocide) and partially because his power was so extreme. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\" (\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Densetsu no Ch\u014d Saiya-jin) told of in legends, with his destructive tendencies only being quelled by a special controlling device created by scientists for his father, Paragus (\u30d1\u30e9\u30ac\u30b9, Paragasu). In movie eight, after Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Future Trunks as well as Piccolo before killing his father. He is eventually defeated by Goku, but somehow manages to make his way into an escape pod. In movie ten, he lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goku's son Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten by their combined Kamehameha attack after being blasted through the sun. Though in movie eleven, blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone, \"Bio-Broly\" (\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Baio Buror\u012b). The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, transforming him into a bio-mutant of sorts. He is eventually killed by Goten, Trunks, and Kuririn. He is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese films, and Vic Mignogna in the Funimation dub.\n\ndoc21590: Goku. Son Goku (Japanese: \u5b6b \u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Son Gok\u016b) is a fictional character and main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong, a main character in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Goku first made his debut in Dragon Ball chapter #1 Bulma and Son Goku (\u30d6\u30eb\u30de\u3068\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Buruma to Son Gok\u016b), originally published in Japan's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984,[1] as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the wish-granting Dragon Balls.\n\ndoc196098: Bulma. In Dragon Ball GT she becomes possessed by Baby, who takes her as his apparent queen (or second in command), as possessing Vegeta gave him all of his memories and emotions. During this time, she organizes the migration to Planet Vegeta (renamed Planet Tuffle), and creates the Super Bruits Wave Generator (\u8d85\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c4\u6ce2\u767a\u751f\u88c5\u7f6e, Ch\u014d Bur\u016btsuha Hassei S\u014dchi) that helps Baby become the Saiyan's Golden Great Ape transformation. However, the Holy Water hidden in Dende's Lookout is used to free her and the rest of Earth from Baby's enslavement. Later, she helps Vegeta reach Super Saiyan 4 by exposing him to a new Super Bruits Wave Generator, and witnesses Omega Shenron's defeat at the hands of Goku.[35]\n\ndoc2341559: Dragon Ball GT. The real Shenlong appears to grant Goku and his friends one last wish, and then proceeds to disappear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d along with Goku and the Dragon Balls. Several decades later, Goku's great-great-grandson, Goku Jr., participates in the World Tournament against Vegeta Jr., as his grandmother Pan cheers for him. Pan then sees Goku and tries to approach him but Goku disappears into the crowd. Goku then leaves the World Tournament with a flashback of his timeline. After the flashback of his timeline ends, Goku then catches his power pole and rides off on his Flying Nimbus cloud.\n\ndoc227802: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Vegeta soon loses patience with Paragus and decides to return to Earth with the others, but Goku and the others confront Paragus, having realised that Broly is in fact the Legendary Super Saiyan himself. The slaves, upon seeing Broly, also identify him as the one who destroyed their planet, but Broly again becomes fixated on Goku, and his rage erupts so much that he breaks free of the mind control device and transforms into a behemoth of a Super Saiyan: the Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly sets his eyes on Goku and begins fighting him and the others, while Vegeta, frightened of the Legendary Super Saiyan, loses the will to fight. Paragus taunts Vegeta for his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and reveals his true story and intentions: many years ago, on Planet Vegeta, Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, (but Goku was born with a power level of 2), which was an impressive feat for anyone, let alone a baby to achieve. However, King Vegeta feared that the baby would grow up to become a threat to his royal family line and ordered him executed. Paragus barged into the court and begged King Vegeta to spare him, but he refused and severely wounded Paragus. Broly was stabbed in the stomach, and he and Paragus were left for dead. However, that same day, Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, and just before the explosion, Broly manifested his anger to blast him and Paragus away from Planet Vegeta only seconds before demolition. Because of Goku's crying, the attempted execution, and having to survive the Saiyan eradication, Broly grew into a severely unstable child. At one point, he even blinded Paragus in one eye, and Paragus only managed to pacify him via the mind control device. Since then, Paragus' goal has been revenge on King Vegeta through his son, Vegeta, and to take over the Earth as a new Planet Vegeta from which to rule the entire universe. Furthermore, a comet, Camori, is approaching New Vegeta, and will destroy it upon impact.\n\ndoc227801: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. On New Vegeta, Vegeta meets Paragus' son, Broly, and the two leave together to hunt down the Legendary Super Saiyan. Gohan, Trunks and Krillin meet the planet's slaves and defend them from their abusive masters. During the struggle, Goku arrives via Instant Transmission, having followed their energy signals after King Kai's story. The slaves tell them that the Legendary Super Saiyan destroyed their planet, and they were found by Paragus, who made them into his slaves. That night, Vegeta and Broly return, having had no luck. While Vegeta receives Goku coldly, Broly appears agitated at the mere sight of him, and only calms down when Paragus raises his hand and a light shines on his bracelet. Despite this, Broly attacks Goku in the middle of the night. The two fight evenly matched for a while until Paragus appears and calms Broly down again. After the fight Goku suspects that Broly is the Legendary Super Saiyan due to their similar ki and also begins to doubt Paragus' claims. Paragus, for his part, has been controlling Broly with a mind control device, which he suspects may be malfunctioning. Paragus then realises that it is Broly's connection to Goku that has made him angry: Broly and Goku were born on the same day and were in neighbouring pods, and Goku's constant crying agitated Broly so much that it made him resent Goku for many years afterwards, and now, having come face to face with him, old wounds have begun to surface.\n\ndoc83783: Dragon Ball Z. Upon his return to Earth a year later, Goku encounters a time traveler named Trunks, the future son of Bulma and Vegeta, who warns Goku that two Artificial Humans (\u4eba\u9020\u4eba\u9593, Jinz\u014dningen, lit. \"Artificial Humans\") will appear three years later, seeking revenge against Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army when he was a child. During this time, an evil life form called Cell emerges and after absorbing two of the Artificial Humans to achieve his \"perfect form,\" holds his own fighting tournament to decide the fate of the Earth, called the \"Cell Games\". After Goku sacrifices his own life a second time, to no avail, Gohan avenges his father by defeating Cell after ascending to the second level of Super Saiyan. Seven years later Goku, who has been briefly revived for one day and meets his youngest son Goten, and his allies are drawn into a fight by the Kaioshin against a magical being named Majin Buu. After numerous battles resulting in the destruction and recreation of the Earth, Goku (whose life is permanently restored by the Elder Kaioshin) destroys Majin Buu with a Genki Dama attack containing the energy of everyone on Earth. Goku makes a wish for Buu to be reincarnated as a good person and ten years later, at another martial arts tournament, Goku meets Buu's human reincarnation, Uub. Leaving the match between them unfinished, Goku departs with Uub to train him to become Earth's new defender.\n\ndoc2341555: Dragon Ball GT. Five years after the end of the Dragon Ball Z anime (10 years in the Funimation dub),[1] Goku is turned back into a child by the Black Star Dragon Balls (\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb, D\u0101ku Doragon B\u014dru, lit. \"Dark Dragon Balls\") used by Pilaf and is forced to travel across the universe to retrieve them along with his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. The trio go through various adventures in their journey to find the Black Star Dragon Balls, until they encounter the evil artificial Tuffle, Baby, who intends to destroy the Saiyan race.\n\n"

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n",

There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug.

It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\n***\n\nPrevious query reformulations:\n***\n\n***\n\nOutput only your reformulated query:",

Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not.[12] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.[13] When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku's massive power up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt that since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable.[14] With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as protagonist, but Toriyama decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role.[6] According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person rather than a hero as his main wish in the story is fighting against strong enemies rather than protecting the innocents. As a result, once Dragon Ball started having animated versions where Goku is portrayed as a hero instead, Toriyama is angry at this.[15]\n\ndoc21597: Goku. During the plans of the final story arc of Dragon Ball Super, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku's previous Super Saiyan transformations.[17]\n\ndoc2409398: Vegeta. Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues.[90][91][92] Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9SS\uff08\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\uff09, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin Goddo S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation beyond Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai\u014d-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation), who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta).\n\ndoc2493018: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc21598: Goku. Goku is usually recognized by his unique hairstyle, which does not change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans.[18] Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises change to blue (hence its nickname \"Super Saiyan Blue\"). Goku prefers dressing in a\n\ndoc21593: Goku. Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku but has a pair of wings.[4] When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[5] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature.[6] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[7] Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin).[8] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[9]\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc311104: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes. Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc834588: Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Four years later, Goku attains the power of a god and faces more challenges. He defends the Earth against powerful destructive deities and travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents and nearly unstoppable foes. Dragon Ball Super reveals the events of the ten year time skip following chapter 517 of the original manga and anime.\n\ndoc2341558: Dragon Ball GT. Due to overuse of the Dragon Balls, seven Shadow Dragons are then created. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated.

Again, Goku is seen transforming from a Golden Great Ape to a Super Saiyan 4, but at the beginning of the episode this time. In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.\n\ndoc21596: Goku. Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT.

After traveling another great distance, Goku runs into a purple pig-like demon, with the ability to manipulate his forearms into weapons. A grizzly bear, thankful to Goku for helping her cub earlier, attacks the demon trying to distract it so Goku and the cub could escape. Goku becomes enraged, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily dismisses the demon, and soon after passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. Goku arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds the old house which Grandpa Gohan harbored his ancestor in. He goes inside the old, dusty house, and finds the four-star Dragon Ball in the same place Goku kept it many years ago. He takes it and, thinking that you can have one ball to grant the wish, tries to summon Shenron. When nothing happens, Goku becomes aggravated and shouts at the Dragon Ball as if there is someone in there. Again, when nothing happens, Goku throws the ball away, and starts yelling, telling himself that he was foolish to believe such a fairy tale about the Dragon Balls. Apparently, the Dragon Ball rolled to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku himself.\n\ndoc2493015: Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy. The special starts off with Baby's defeat at Super Saiyan 4 Goku's hands. The scene then advances 100 years into the future. All of the Z Fighters (Goku, Vegeta and their friends and families) have passed away of natural causes, except Pan, who is old. She has a great-great grandson[note 1] named Goku Jr., who resembles his great-great-great-great grandfather[note 2] Goku, but lacks the latter's courage and fighting spirit. Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather. She then tries to get him to train, but he has no confidence and skills in anything. At school, he is bullied by Puck, a senior classmate, and his gang, who take his favorite pen. Pan is angry that Goku didn't fight back and is so carefree. This causes her blood pressure to rise and she faints, and is hospitalized.\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc21597: Goku.

After a second defeat at the hands of the three Saiyans, Baby infects Trunks and then goes to Earth. On Earth he battles Goten and Gohan, infects them both, and is able to infect Vegeta and make him his primary host. Goku, Trunks, and Pan return to Earth to find the entire population is now under Baby's control. Baby is able to defeat Goku, then he begins using the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats Goku again. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku is able to defeat \"Baby-Vegeta\". He has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a 10x Kamehameha attack, sending it into the sun. The ship is destroyed and Baby is obliterated. He is voiced by Yusuke Numata in Japanese media and by Mike McFarland in the Funimation anime dub.\n\ndoc2341556: Dragon Ball GT. Baby has the ability to invade other people's bodies and turn them into Tuffles, as well as using a body to combine it with his own power and become a fighter. After turning practically all of the Earth's population, including the Saiyans, into Tuffles, Baby decides to remain inside Vegeta's body and use it to confront Goku. Goku fights him and is defeated, but after having his tail regenerated, transforms, achieving the power of Super Saiyan 4 (\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin F\u014d), and destroys Baby, propelling him into the sun with a Kamehameha Wave. Piccolo then sacrifices himself to turn the Black Star Dragon Balls into stone permanently when the Earth explodes after Goku and the others helped everyone evacuate to the Tuffle Planet.\n\ndoc1715835: List of Dragon Ball characters. Broly (\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Buror\u012b) is an anime-only character that appears in the eighth, tenth, and eleventh Dragon Ball Z movies as the main villain. He was born with a power greater than most elite adult Saiyans, and is mentally unsettled as an adult, partially due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, partially because of traumatic events during his childhood (including nearly being executed for his power as well as Freeza's genocide) and partially because his power was so extreme. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\" (\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Densetsu no Ch\u014d Saiya-jin) told of in legends, with his destructive tendencies only being quelled by a special controlling device created by scientists for his father, Paragus (\u30d1\u30e9\u30ac\u30b9, Paragasu). In movie eight, after Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Future Trunks as well as Piccolo before killing his father. He is eventually defeated by Goku, but somehow manages to make his way into an escape pod. In movie ten, he lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goku's son Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten by their combined Kamehameha attack after being blasted through the sun. Though in movie eleven, blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone, \"Bio-Broly\" (\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc, Baio Buror\u012b). The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, transforming him into a bio-mutant of sorts. He is eventually killed by Goten, Trunks, and Kuririn. He is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese films, and Vic Mignogna in the Funimation dub.\n\ndoc21590: Goku. Son Goku (Japanese: \u5b6b \u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Son Gok\u016b) is a fictional character and main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong, a main character in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Goku first made his debut in Dragon Ball chapter #1 Bulma and Son Goku (\u30d6\u30eb\u30de\u3068\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Buruma to Son Gok\u016b), originally published in Japan's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984,[1] as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the wish-granting Dragon Balls.\n\ndoc196098: Bulma. In Dragon Ball GT she becomes possessed by Baby, who takes her as his apparent queen (or second in command), as possessing Vegeta gave him all of his memories and emotions. During this time, she organizes the migration to Planet Vegeta (renamed Planet Tuffle), and creates the Super Bruits Wave Generator (\u8d85\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c4\u6ce2\u767a\u751f\u88c5\u7f6e, Ch\u014d Bur\u016btsuha Hassei S\u014dchi) that helps Baby become the Saiyan's Golden Great Ape transformation. However, the Holy Water hidden in Dende's Lookout is used to free her and the rest of Earth from Baby's enslavement. Later, she helps Vegeta reach Super Saiyan 4 by exposing him to a new Super Bruits Wave Generator, and witnesses Omega Shenron's defeat at the hands of Goku.[35]\n\ndoc2341559: Dragon Ball GT. The real Shenlong appears to grant Goku and his friends one last wish, and then proceeds to disappear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d along with Goku and the Dragon Balls. Several decades later, Goku's great-great-grandson, Goku Jr., participates in the World Tournament against Vegeta Jr., as his grandmother Pan cheers for him. Pan then sees Goku and tries to approach him but Goku disappears into the crowd. Goku then leaves the World Tournament with a flashback of his timeline. After the flashback of his timeline ends, Goku then catches his power pole and rides off on his Flying Nimbus cloud.\n\ndoc227802: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Vegeta soon loses patience with Paragus and decides to return to Earth with the others, but Goku and the others confront Paragus, having realised that Broly is in fact the Legendary Super Saiyan himself. The slaves, upon seeing Broly, also identify him as the one who destroyed their planet, but Broly again becomes fixated on Goku, and his rage erupts so much that he breaks free of the mind control device and transforms into a behemoth of a Super Saiyan: the Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly sets his eyes on Goku and begins fighting him and the others, while Vegeta, frightened of the Legendary Super Saiyan, loses the will to fight. Paragus taunts Vegeta for his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and reveals his true story and intentions: many years ago, on Planet Vegeta, Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, (but Goku was born with a power level of 2), which was an impressive feat for anyone, let alone a baby to achieve. However, King Vegeta feared that the baby would grow up to become a threat to his royal family line and ordered him executed. Paragus barged into the court and begged King Vegeta to spare him, but he refused and severely wounded Paragus. Broly was stabbed in the stomach, and he and Paragus were left for dead. However, that same day, Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, and just before the explosion, Broly manifested his anger to blast him and Paragus away from Planet Vegeta only seconds before demolition. Because of Goku's crying, the attempted execution, and having to survive the Saiyan eradication, Broly grew into a severely unstable child. At one point, he even blinded Paragus in one eye, and Paragus only managed to pacify him via the mind control device. Since then, Paragus' goal has been revenge on King Vegeta through his son, Vegeta, and to take over the Earth as a new Planet Vegeta from which to rule the entire universe. Furthermore, a comet, Camori, is approaching New Vegeta, and will destroy it upon impact.\n\ndoc227801: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. On New Vegeta, Vegeta meets Paragus' son, Broly, and the two leave together to hunt down the Legendary Super Saiyan. Gohan, Trunks and Krillin meet the planet's slaves and defend them from their abusive masters. During the struggle, Goku arrives via Instant Transmission, having followed their energy signals after King Kai's story. The slaves tell them that the Legendary Super Saiyan destroyed their planet, and they were found by Paragus, who made them into his slaves. That night, Vegeta and Broly return, having had no luck. While Vegeta receives Goku coldly, Broly appears agitated at the mere sight of him, and only calms down when Paragus raises his hand and a light shines on his bracelet. Despite this, Broly attacks Goku in the middle of the night. The two fight evenly matched for a while until Paragus appears and calms Broly down again. After the fight Goku suspects that Broly is the Legendary Super Saiyan due to their similar ki and also begins to doubt Paragus' claims. Paragus, for his part, has been controlling Broly with a mind control device, which he suspects may be malfunctioning. Paragus then realises that it is Broly's connection to Goku that has made him angry: Broly and Goku were born on the same day and were in neighbouring pods, and Goku's constant crying agitated Broly so much that it made him resent Goku for many years afterwards, and now, having come face to face with him, old wounds have begun to surface.\n\ndoc83783: Dragon Ball Z.
