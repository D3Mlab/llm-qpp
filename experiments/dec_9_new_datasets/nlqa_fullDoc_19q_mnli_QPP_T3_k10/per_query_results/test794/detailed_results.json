In 1989, the first version of the GNU General Public License was published.[26] A slightly updated version 2 was published in 1991. In 1989, some GNU developers formed the company Cygnus Solutions.[27] The GNU project's kernel, later called \"GNU Hurd\", was continually delayed, but most other components were completed by 1991.

So if you were going to pick a name for the system based on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate single choice would be GNU. But we don't think that is the right way to consider the question. The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific software packages.

In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to write a complete operating system free from constraints on use of its source code. Particular incidents that motivated this include a case where an annoying printer couldn't be fixed because the source code was withheld from users.[24] Stallman also published the GNU Manifesto in 1985 to outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of free software. Another probable inspiration for the GNU project and its manifesto was a disagreement between Stallman and Symbolics, Inc. over MIT's access to updates Symbolics had made to its Lisp machine, which was based on MIT code.[25] Soon after the launch, he[17] used[clarification needed] the existing term \"free software\" and founded the Free Software Foundation to promote the concept.
