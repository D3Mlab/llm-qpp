There are a number of applications for hair transplant surgery, including:\n\ndoc51691: Hair transplantation. Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding, (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp. Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.\n\ndoc51697: Hair transplantation. There are two main ways in which donor grafts are extracted today: strip excision harvesting, and follicular unit extraction.\n\ndoc51714: Hair transplantation. Advancing the theory of donor dominance, Walter P. Unger, M.D. defined the parameters of the \"Safe Donor Zone\" from which the most permanent hair follicles could be extracted for hair transplantation.[11] As transplanted hair will only grow in its new site for as long as it would have in its original one, these parameters continue to serve as the fundamental foundation for hair follicle harvesting, whether by strip method or FUE.\n\ndoc51719: Hair transplantation. Stem cells and dermal papilla cells have been discovered in hair follicles. Research on these follicular cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through hair multiplication (HM), also known as hair cloning.\n\ndoc51713: Hair transplantation. The modern era of hair transplantation in the western world was ushered in the late 1950s, when New York dermatologist Norman Orentreich began to experiment with free donor grafts to balding areas in patients with male pattern baldness. Previously it had been thought that transplanted hair would thrive no more than the original hair at the \"recipient\" site. Orentreich demonstrated that such grafts were \"donor dominant,\" as the new hairs grew and lasted just as they would have at their original home.[10]\n\ndoc51708: Hair transplantation. If donor hair numbers from the back of the head are insufficient, it is possible to perform body hair transplantation (BHT) on appropriate candidates who have available donor hair on the chest, back, shoulders, torso and/or legs. Body hair transplant surgery can only be performed by the FUE harvesting method and, so, requires the skills of an experienced FUE surgeon. However, there are several factors for a potential BHT candidate to consider prior to surgery. These include understanding the natural difference in textural characteristics between body hair and scalp hair, growth rates, and having realistic expectations about the results of BHT surgery.\n\ndoc51710: Hair transplantation. During the first ten days, some of the transplanted hairs, inevitably traumatized by their relocation, may fall out. This is referred to as \"shock loss\".

Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.\n\ndoc51697: Hair transplantation. There are two main ways in which donor grafts are extracted today: strip excision harvesting, and follicular unit extraction.\n\ndoc51714: Hair transplantation. Advancing the theory of donor dominance, Walter P. Unger, M.D. defined the parameters of the \"Safe Donor Zone\" from which the most permanent hair follicles could be extracted for hair transplantation.[11] As transplanted hair will only grow in its new site for as long as it would have in its original one, these parameters continue to serve as the fundamental foundation for hair follicle harvesting, whether by strip method or FUE.\n\ndoc51719: Hair transplantation. Stem cells and dermal papilla cells have been discovered in hair follicles. Research on these follicular cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through hair multiplication (HM), also known as hair cloning.\n\ndoc51713: Hair transplantation. The modern era of hair transplantation in the western world was ushered in the late 1950s, when New York dermatologist Norman Orentreich began to experiment with free donor grafts to balding areas in patients with male pattern baldness. Previously it had been thought that transplanted hair would thrive no more than the original hair at the \"recipient\" site. Orentreich demonstrated that such grafts were \"donor dominant,\" as the new hairs grew and lasted just as they would have at their original home.[10]\n\ndoc51708: Hair transplantation. If donor hair numbers from the back of the head are insufficient, it is possible to perform body hair transplantation (BHT) on appropriate candidates who have available donor hair on the chest, back, shoulders, torso and/or legs. Body hair transplant surgery can only be performed by the FUE harvesting method and, so, requires the skills of an experienced FUE surgeon. However, there are several factors for a potential BHT candidate to consider prior to surgery. These include understanding the natural difference in textural characteristics between body hair and scalp hair, growth rates, and having realistic expectations about the results of BHT surgery.\n\ndoc51710: Hair transplantation. During the first ten days, some of the transplanted hairs, inevitably traumatized by their relocation, may fall out. This is referred to as \"shock loss\". After two to three months new hair will begin to grow from the moved follicles. The patient's hair will grow normally, and continue to thicken through the next six to nine months. Any subsequent hair loss is likely to be only from untreated areas. Some patients elect to use medications to retard such loss, while others plan a subsequent transplant procedure to deal with this eventuality.\n\n"

Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding, (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp. Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants.
