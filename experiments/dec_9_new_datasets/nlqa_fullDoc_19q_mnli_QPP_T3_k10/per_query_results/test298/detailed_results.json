Return only a python list of docID strings with a length of exactly 10 IDs.\n\nExample output format: [\"docID1\",...,\"dockID10\"]\n\nQuery: where does the expression go commando come from\n\nDocuments:\n\ndoc11254: Going commando. The origins of the phrase \"go commando\" are uncertain, with some speculating that it may refer to being \"out in the open\" or \"ready for action\".[5]\n\ndoc11256: Going commando. The term appeared in the 1982 novel Groundrush by Greg Barron, in the sentence, \"Bigfoot's jock snapped underneath, leaving him to 'go commando'.\"[9] In the Chicago Tribune of January 22, 1985, Jim Spencer wrote, \"Furthermore, coloured briefs are 'sleazy' and going without underwear ('going commando', as they say on campus) is simply gross.\" The term gained currency in the popular vernacular after appearing in a 1996 episode of Friends.[10][11]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc2546828: Go-go dancing. The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops. A synonym used in Vietnam for go-go dancers is \"table dancer\".\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\n",

I fear that we may be on the verge of becoming an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control not just the economy, but the political life of this country. And that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have wrestle with.\n\ndoc11249: Politics of the United States. The effects of oligarchy on democracy and the economy were key points of the 2016 presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders[53] and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[54] Bernie Sanders said about the Citizens United verdict and the Republicans' rise to power in Congress,\n\n"

The origins of the phrase \"go commando\" are uncertain, with some speculating that it may refer to being \"out in the open\" or \"ready for action\".[5]\n\ndoc11256: Going commando. The term appeared in the 1982 novel Groundrush by Greg Barron, in the sentence, \"Bigfoot's jock snapped underneath, leaving him to 'go commando'.\"[9] In the Chicago Tribune of January 22, 1985, Jim Spencer wrote, \"Furthermore, coloured briefs are 'sleazy' and going without underwear ('going commando', as they say on campus) is simply gross.\" The term gained currency in the popular vernacular after appearing in a 1996 episode of Friends.[10][11]\n\ndoc11257: Going commando. Whilst going commando solely refers to the practice of not wearing underpants, a number of variations on the theme of not wearing a particular item of clothing do exist. Most notably, and particularly popular among the British expat populations living in Spain is the phrase \"going fommando\", which supplants the 'C' of commando for the letter 'F'. The expression, believed to be coined by Thomas Dobbs Lazaro[12], during the 2013 Spanish heatwave[13], refers to the practice of going outside without shoes (in just barefeet)[14].\n\ndoc11255: Going commando. Slate magazine's Daniel Engber dates the modern usage to United States college campuses circa 1974, where it was perhaps associated with soldiers in the Vietnam War, who were reputed to go without underwear to \"increase ventilation and reduce moisture\".[6] However, more recently, Graeme Donald has pointed out that the US Forces are \"Rangers\" rather than \"Commandos\", and that in any case, the phrase was in use in the UK, referring mainly to women, from the late 1960s.[1] The connection to the UK and women has been suggested to link to a World War II euphemism for prostitutes working in London's West End, who were termed \"Piccadilly Commandos\".[7][8]\n\ndoc11253: Going commando. In Chile, the act of not wearing underwear has been called \"andar a lo gringo\" (to go gringo-style) for decades.[4]\n\ndoc11251: Going commando. Going commando, or free-balling for males and free-buffing for females, is the practice of not wearing underpants under clothes.[1]\n\ndoc2590601: The One Where No One's Ready. Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \"best of\" DVD releases[6] and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004.[7] Joey's use of the phrase \"going commando,\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media.\n\ndoc2546828: Go-go dancing. The term go-go derives from the phrase \"go-go-go\" for a high-energy person,[4] and was influenced by the French expression \u00e0 gogo, meaning \"in abundance, galore\",[5] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \"joy, happiness\".[6]\n\ndoc2546831: Go-go dancing. The phrase go-go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was abandoned by a majority of clubs and appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as go-go dancers. During the Vietnam War there were many go-go bars in Saigon, South Vietnam, to entertain U.S.\u00c2\u00a0troops. A synonym used in Vietnam for go-go dancers is \"table dancer\".\n\ndoc11252: Going commando. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts,[citation needed] some ordinary shorts such as Bermuda shorts, also, jogging pants[citation needed] , kilts and men's sarongs, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underwear.[2][3] This also applies for most clothes worn as swimwear, sportswear or nightwear.\n\n"
