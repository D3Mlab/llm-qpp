Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n",

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly was born with a power level of 10,000, a power level greater than most elite Saiyan warriors. He is mentally unstable due to a culmination of events in his childhood, such as the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, the threatening events pertaining to his birth date, and being born with an extreme power level. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n"

He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", although his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Super Saiyan Gohan, and Super Saiyan Future Trunks, as well as Super Namekian Piccolo, before killing his father by crushing him in his escape pod. Broly is eventually defeated by Goku, but he manages to make his way to an escape pod, and would return as the antagonist of the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie.\n\ndoc1199353: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug. Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, also known by its Japanese title Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku the Super Saiyan (Japanese: \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ \u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u3060\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a, Hepburn: Doragon B\u014dru Zetto S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin da Son Gok\u016b), is the fourth Dragon Ball Z feature movie. It was originally released in Japan on March 9, 1991 between episodes 81 and 82 at the Toei Anime Fair as part of a double feature with the first Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun movie. An American English dub was produced by Funimation and released to VHS and DVD on August 7, 2001. Two other English dubs were also produced, one in France by AB Groupe done for European markets which was released under the misspelt title Super Saiya Son Goku, and another one for a Malaysian VCD release by Speedy Video which had the title Super Saiya People, Goku. While the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown, the AB Groupe dub was revealed to have been recorded by English-speaking actors based in France who have also done voices for animated television series such as Code Lyoko and Chris Colorado.[1]\n\n"

Dragon Ball GT chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku's Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's \u014czaru (\u5927\u733f, lit. \"Great Ape\") form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[16]\n\ndoc2521897: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta featured first in Fusion Reborn through the fusion dance. Gogeta wears a fusion jacket and always appears as a Super Saiyan. In Fusion Reborn, Goku and a reluctant Vegeta fused to become him when they couldn't stand a chance against Janemba. However, the fusion first failed due to Vegeta's uneven finger positions and became a fat warrior dubbed Veku by the South Kai. Gogeta overpowers Janemba by far and quickly gets rid of him with his Stardust Breaker attack. Gogeta can be considered canonical to the anime's chronology, as Goku and Vegeta fuse once more in Dragon Ball GT, both in their Super Saiyan 4 state to create a Super Saiyan 4 version of him. Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta has red, semi long spiky hair with fur and also wears a fusion jacket. Unlike his Dragon Ball Z appearance who is very serious and has no time to waste, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is cocky, playful and fools with Omega Shenron before the fusion wears off. All of Gogeta's forms are done by the combined voice actors of Goku and Vegeta.\n\ndoc761601: Dragon Ball. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (\u8d85 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc)\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba, S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\n\ndoc2341561: Dragon Ball GT. Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations.

There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.[3]\n\ndoc21608: Goku. In the film Fusion Reborn, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta (\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf, Goj\u012bta), who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.[56] In the anime-only sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, Goku is transformed back into a kid by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world.[57] Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb.[58] Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.[59]\n\ndoc21604: Goku. After defeating Frieza and barely escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Id\u014d (\u77ac\u9593\u79fb\u52d5, lit. \"Instant Teleport\", renamed \"Instant Transmission\" in Funimation's dub), taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.[47] However, Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Later, Goku trains his first son Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten. Goku also battles Vegeta again after Vegeta falls under the control of the wizard Babidi. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku teaches Goten and Trunks to take his place. After his life is permanently restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8, Bejitto, \"Vegerot\" in Viz Media's manga translation).[48] Eventually, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu's human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.[49]\n\ndoc21609: Goku. Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film[60] and an unofficial Korean live-action film.[61] He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature Dragonball Evolution.[62] Goku has also appeared in almost every Dragon Ball licensed electronic video game, including crossover games such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and Battle Stadium D.O.N. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World,[63] in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the Dragon Ball timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled Jumpland@Second Life.[64] Goku also appears in the Dr. Slump and Arale-chan video game for the Nintendo DS.[65]\n\ndoc21603: Goku. Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and sacrifices himself to defeat Raditz after he learns about his heritage.[42][43] Goku comes from a race of extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life.[44] While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku suffered a severe head injury and forgets his mission to conquer Earth.[44] In order to fight the Saiyans invading Earth, Goku trains with King Kai in the afterlife. He teaches Goku the Kai\u014d-ken (\u754c\u738b\u62f3, lit. \"World King Fist\"), which multiplies his ki and strength for an instant, but with possible strain to the body.[45] It is also from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the Genki-Dama (\u5143\u6c17\u7389, lit. \"Energy Sphere\", renamed \"Spirit Bomb\" in Funimation's dub), an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans.[22] After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.[46]\n\ndoc227805: Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan.
