Examples of desirable features would include extensive walking or cycling paths, readily available outdoor seating areas in cafes and restaurants, and a variety of museums or historical sites that are not typically overcrowded.  Ideally, the cities should also offer a range of culinary experiences beyond typical tourist traps, showcasing local cuisine and diverse dining options.\n"
