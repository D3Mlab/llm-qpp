I'm looking for cities offering a mix of iconic landmarks, hidden gems, vibrant street art scenes, unique cultural experiences (e.g., festivals, local markets), and opportunities for adventure activities or nature-based content.  Ideally, the cities should also offer good infrastructure for vloggers, such as reliable internet access, safe filming locations, and diverse food options to showcase. For example, I'd like to know which cities offer a blend of historical architecture suitable for aesthetically pleasing shots, alongside modern, trendy areas perfect for showcasing current fashion or street food.\n",
