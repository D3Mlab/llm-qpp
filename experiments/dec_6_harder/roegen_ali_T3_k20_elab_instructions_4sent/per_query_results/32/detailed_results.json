I'm interested in cities offering a balance between amenities (e.g., restaurants, cultural attractions) and opportunities for disconnecting from technology, perhaps with options for hiking, camping, or other nature-based experiences nearby.  Examples of desirable features would include areas with weak or unreliable cellular signals, limited public Wi-Fi hotspots, and a focus on outdoor recreation rather than digital entertainment.  Ideally, the city would also offer a range of accommodation options, from rustic cabins to comfortable hotels, catering to different budgets and preferences.\n",

I'm interested in cities offering a balance between amenities (e.g., restaurants, cultural attractions) and opportunities for disconnecting from technology, perhaps with options for hiking, camping, or other nature-based experiences nearby.  Examples of desirable features would include areas with weak or unreliable cellular signals, limited public Wi-Fi hotspots, and a focus on outdoor recreation rather than digital entertainment.  Ideally, the city would also offer a range of accommodation options, from rustic cabins to comfortable hotels, catering to different budgets and preferences.\n"
