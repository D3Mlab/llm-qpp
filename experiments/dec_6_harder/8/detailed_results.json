I'm interested in cities offering a balance of cultural experiences, outdoor activities, and social opportunities appealing to young adults (18-35),  with a focus on accessibility for those with varying budgets.  For example, I'd like information on cities with affordable yet safe accommodation options (beyond hostels),  free or low-cost activities like museums with youth discounts or free walking tours, and details on transportation options beyond public transit, such as bike rentals or ride-sharing services.
