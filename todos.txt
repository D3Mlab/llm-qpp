- forbid retrieval of documents already in previously retrieved lists
- prompt engineer (FS, phrasing):

- start config writting notebook
- code and track performance over T
- track duplicates
- Store a dict of docIDs-texts for recently looked up docs (after each new retrieval stage) to avoid second and third corpus search during the termination decision (2) and query reformulation (3) prompt
