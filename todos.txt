- fix derivation over time steps 
- prompt engineer (FS, phrasing):
	- format adherance (e.g. "length is not 10!" - buggy llm output)
	- context: all previous retrieved docs? query reform history?
	- reformulation strategies
		- q2d, q2e
- test various llms
- pre-retrieval query reformulation
- start config writting notebook
- track duplicates
- Store a dict of docIDs-texts for recently looked up docs (after each new retrieval stage) to avoid second and third corpus search during the termination decision (2) and query reformulation (3) prompt
